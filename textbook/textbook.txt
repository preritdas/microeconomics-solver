Maya, Talia, and Shira
Sarah and RachelviRevising a textbook every three or four years is hard work, and the last 
edition was well-liked by students. “So why is our publisher pushing for a new edition?” the authors wondered. “Were some of the examples 
becoming stale? Or might it have something to do with the used book market?” Could be both. In any case, here they are again, with a new edition that has sub-stantial improvements and lots of new examples.
Robert S. Pindyck is the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. Professor of Economics 
and Finance in the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T. Daniel L. Rubinfeld is the Robert L. Bridges Professor of Law and Professor of Economics Emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, and Professor of Law at NYU. Both received their Ph.Ds from M.I.T., Pindyck in 1971 and Rubinfeld in 1972. Professor Pindyck’s research and writing have covered a variety of topics in microeconom-ics, including the effects of uncertainty on firm behavior and market structure; the behavior of natural resource, commodity, and financial markets; environmen-tal economics; and criteria for investment decisions. Professor Rubinfeld, who served as chief economist at the Department of Justice in 1997 and 1998, is the author of a variety of articles relating to antitrust, competition policy, law and economics, law and statistics, and public economics.
Pindyck and Rubinfeld are also co-authors of Econometric Models and Economic 
Forecasts , another best-selling textbook that makes a perfect gift (birthdays, 
weddings, bar mitzvahs, you name it) for the man or woman who has every-thing. (Buy several—bulk pricing is available.) These two authors are always looking for ways to earn some extra spending money, so they enrolled as human subjects in a double-blind test of a new hair restoration medication. Rubinfeld strongly suspects that he is being given the placebo.
This is probably more than you want to know about these authors, but for 
further information, see their Web sites: http://web.mit.edu/rpindyck/www  
and http://www.law.berkeley.edu/faculty/rubinfeldd .ABOUT THE AUTHORS
The authors, back again for a 
new edition, reflect on their years of successful textbook collaboration. Pindyck is on the right and Rubinfeld on the left.

PREFACE
For students who care about how the world works, microeconomics is 
probably the most relevant, interesting, and important subject they can study. (Macroeconomics is the second-most important subject.) A good 
grasp of microeconomics is vital for managerial decision making, for design-ing and understanding public policy, and more generally, for appreciating how a  modern economy functions. In fact, even understanding the news each day often requires knowledge of microeconomics.
We wrote this book, Microeconomics , because we believe that students need to 
be exposed to the new topics that have come to play a central role in microeco-nomics over the years—topics such as game theory and competitive strategy, the roles of uncertainty and information, and the analysis of pricing by firms with market power. We also felt that students need to be shown how microeco-nomics can help us to understand what goes on in the world and how it can be used as a practical tool for decision making. Microeconomics is an exciting and dynamic subject, but students need to be given an appreciation of its relevance and usefulness. They want and need a good understanding of how microeco-nomics can actually be used outside the classroom.
To respond to these needs, the eighth edition of Microeconomics  provides a 
treatment of microeconomic theory that stresses its relevance and application to both managerial and public policy decision making. This applied emphasis is accomplished by including examples that cover such topics as the analysis of demand, cost, and market efficiency; the design of pricing strategies; investment and production decisions; and public policy analysis. Because of the importance that we attach to these examples, they are included in the flow of the text. (A complete list is included on the endpapers inside the front cover.)
The coverage in this edition of Microeconomics  incorporates the dramatic 
changes that have occurred in the field in recent years. There has been grow-ing interest in game theory and the strategic interactions of firms (Chapters 12 and 13), in the role and implications of uncertainty and asymmetric informa-tion (Chapters 5 and 17), in the pricing strategies of firms with market power (Chapters 10 and 11), and in the design of policies to deal efficiently with exter-nalities such as environmental pollution (Chapter 18).
That the coverage in Microeconomics  is comprehensive and up to date does 
not mean that it is “advanced” or difficult. We have worked hard to make the exposition clear and accessible as well as lively and engaging. We believe that the study of microeconomics should be enjoyable and stimulating. We hope that our book reflects this belief. Except for appendices and footnotes, Microeconomics  
uses no calculus. As a result, it should be suitable for students with a broad range of backgrounds. (Those sections that are more demanding are marked with an asterisk and can be easily omitted.)xviii  •  PREFACE
Changes in the Eighth Edition
Each new edition of this book has built on the success of prior editions by 
 adding a number of new topics, by adding and updating examples, and by improving the exposition of existing materials.
The eighth edition continues that tradition with a number of new and  modern 
topics.
• We have introduced new material on speculative demand and have 
expanded our discussion of network externalities to include social networks (Chapter 4).
• In Chapter 5 we added a new section on bubbles and informational cas-
cades, along with examples showing applications to housing markets and the financial crisis. We also expanded and updated the material on behav-ioral economics.
• We expanded the Appendix to Chapter 11 so that it now covers the vertically 
integrated firm more broadly, including the problem of double marginaliza-tion and the advantages of vertical integration, along with the analysis of transfer pricing.
We added a number of new examples and updated most of the existing ones. 
• We introduced a series of examples relating to the economics of health care, 
including the demand for and production of health care (Chapters 3, 6, 16, and 17). 
• We also added a series of examples on taxicab markets that illustrate the 
effects of government policies that restrict output (Chapters 8, 9, and 15). 
• We added examples on energy demand and energy efficiency (Chapters 4 
and 7), and “contagion” in global financial markets (Chapter 16). 
• We have even added an example that explains the pricing of this textbook 
(Chapter 12).
As in each new addition, we worked hard to improve the exposition wher-
ever possible. For this edition, we revised and improved the treatment of some of the core material on production and cost (Chapters 7 and 8), as well as the treatment of general equilibrium and economic efficiency (Chapter 16). We made a variety of other changes, including revisions of some of the figures, to make the exposition as clear and readable as possible.
The layout of this edition is similar to that of the prior edition. This has 
allowed us to continue to define key terms in the margins (as well as in the Glossary at the end of the book) and to use the margins to include Concept Links that relate newly developed ideas to concepts introduced previously in the text.
Alternative Course Designs
This new edition of Microeconomics  offers instructors considerable flexibility 
in course design. For a one-quarter or one-semester course stressing the basic core material, we would suggest using the following chapters and 
sections of chapters: 1 through 6, 7.1–7.4, 8 through 10, 11.1–11.3, 12, 14, 15.1–15.4,  18.1–18.2, and 18.5. A somewhat more ambitious course might also include parts PREFACE   •  xix
of Chapters 5 and 16 and additional sections in Chapters 7 and 9. To emphasize 
uncertainty and market failure, an instructor should also include substantial parts of Chapters 5 and 17.
Depending on one’s interests and the goals of the course, other sections could 
be added or used to replace the materials listed above. A course emphasizing modern pricing theory and business strategy would include all of Chapters 11, 12, and 13 and the remaining sections of Chapter 15. A course in managerial economics might also include the appendices to Chapters 4, 7, and 11, as well as the appendix on regression analysis at the end of the book. A course stressing welfare economics and public policy should include Chapter 16 and additional sections of Chapter 18.
Finally, we want to stress that those sections or subsections that are more 
demanding and/or peripheral to the core material have been marked with an asterisk. These sections can easily be omitted without detracting from the flow of the book.
Supplementary Materials
Ancillaries of an exceptionally high quality are available to instructors and students using this book. The Instructor’s Manual , prepared by 
Duncan M. Holthausen of North Carolina State University, provides 
detailed solutions to all end-of-chapter Questions for Review and Exercises. The eighth edition contains many entirely new review questions and exercises, and a number of exercises have been revised and updated. The new instructor’s manual has been revised accordingly. Each chapter also contains Teaching Tips to summarize key points.
The Test Item File , prepared by Douglas J. Miller of the University of Missouri, 
contains approximately 2,000 multiple-choice and short-answer questions with solutions. All of this material has been thoroughly reviewed, accuracy checked, and revised for this edition. The Test Item File is designed for use with TestGen  
test-generating software. TestGen’s graphical interface enables instructors to view, edit, and add questions; transfer questions to tests; and print different forms of tests. Search and sort features let the instructor quickly locate ques-tions and arrange them in a preferred order. QuizMaster, working with your school’s computer network, automatically grades the exams, stores the results on disk, and allows the instructor to view and print a variety of reports.
The PowerPoint Presentation  has been revised for this edition by Fernando 
Quijano of Dickinson State University with editorial consultants Shelly Tefft and Michael Brener. Instructors can edit the detailed outlines to create their own full-color, professional-looking presentations and customized handouts for stu-dents. The PowerPoint Presentation also contains lecture notes and a complete set of animated textbook figures.
The Study Guide , prepared by Valerie Suslow of the University of Michigan 
and Jonathan Hamilton of the University of Florida, provides a wide variety of review materials and exercises for students. Each chapter contains a list of important concepts, chapter highlights, a concept review, problem sets, and a self-test quiz. Worked-out answers and solutions are provided for all exercises, problem sets, and self-test questions.
For your convenience, all instructor resources are available online via our 
centralized supplements Web site, the Instructor Resource Center ( www.

Acknowledgments
As the saying goes, it takes a village to revise a textbook. Because the eighth 
edition of Microeconomics  has been the outgrowth of years of experience 
in the classroom, we owe a debt of gratitude to our students and to the 
colleagues with whom we often discuss microeconomics and its presentation. We have also had the help of capable research assistants. For the first seven editions of the book, these included Peter Adams, Walter Athier, Smita Brunnerneier, Phillip Gibbs, Matt Hartman, Salar Jahedi, Jamie Jue, Rashmi Khare, Jay Kim, Maciej Kotowski, Tammy McGavock, Masaya Okoshi, Kathy O’Regan, Shira Pindyck, Karen Randig, Subi Rangan, Deborah Senior, Ashesh Shah, Nicola Stafford, and Wilson Tai. Kathy Hill helped with the art, while Assunta Kent, Mary Knott, and Dawn Elliott Linahan provided secretarial assistance with the first edition. We especially want to thank Lynn Steele and Jay Tharp, who pro-vided considerable editorial support for the second edition. Mark Glickman and Steve Wiggins assisted with the examples in the third edition, while Andrew Guest, Jeanette Sayre, and Lynn Steele provided valuable editorial support for the third, fourth, and fifth editions, as did Brandi Henson and Jeanette Sayre for the sixth edition, and as did Ida Ng for the seventh edition and Ida Ng and Dagmar Trantinova for the eighth. In addition, Carola Conces and Catherine Martin provided superb research assistance on this eighth  edition.
Writing this book has been both a painstaking and enjoyable process. At each 
stage we received exceptionally fine guidance from teachers of microeconomics throughout the country. After the first draft of the first edition of the book had been edited and reviewed, it was discussed at a two-day focus group meeting in New York. This provided an opportunity to get ideas from instructors with a variety of backgrounds and perspectives. We would like to thank the follow-ing focus group members for advice and criticism: Carl Davidson of Michigan State University; Richard Eastin of the University of Southern California; Judith Roberts of California State University, Long Beach; and Charles Strein of the University of Northern Iowa.

Part 1 surveys the scope of microeconomics  
and introduces some basic concepts and tools. 
Chapter 1 discusses the range of problems that microeconomics 
addresses, and the kinds of answers it can provide. It also explains what a market is, how we determine the boundaries of a market, and how we measure market price.
Chapter 2 covers one of the most important tools of microeco-
nomics: supply-demand analysis. We explain how a competitive market works and how supply and demand determine the prices and quantities of goods and services. We also show how supply-demand analysis can be used to determine the effects of changing market conditions, including government intervention.Introduction: Markets

21This page intentionally left blank  3Economics is divided into two main branches: microeconomics 
and macroeconomics. Microeconomics  deals with the behavior 
of individual economic units. These units include consumers, 
workers, investors, owners of land, business firms—in fact, any indi-vidual or entity that plays a role in the functioning of our economy.
1 
Microeconomics explains how and why these units make economic decisions. For example, it explains how consumers make purchasing decisions and how their choices are affected by changing prices and incomes. It also explains how firms decide how many workers to hire and how workers decide where to work and how much work to do.
Another important concern of microeconomics is how economic units 
interact to form larger units—markets and industries. Microeconomics helps us to understand, for example, why the American automobile industry developed the way it did and how producers and consum-ers interact in the market for automobiles. It explains how automobile prices are determined, how much automobile companies invest in new factories, and how many cars are produced each year. By studying the behavior and interaction of individual firms and consumers, microeco-nomics reveals how industries and markets operate and evolve, why they differ from one another, and how they are affected by government policies and global economic conditions.
By contrast, macroeconomics  deals with aggregate economic quan-
tities, such as the level and growth rate of national output, interest rates, unemployment, and inflation. But the boundary between mac-roeconomics and microeconomics has become less and less distinct in recent years. The reason is that macroeconomics also involves the analysis of markets—for example, the aggregate markets for goods and services, labor, and corporate bonds. To understand how these aggregate markets operate, we must first understand the behavior of the firms, consumers, workers, and investors who constitute them. Thus macroeconomists have become increasingly concerned with the microeconomic foundations of aggregate economic phenomena, and much of macroeconomics is actually an extension of microeconomic analysis.PreliminariesCHAPTER 1

1The prefix micro - is derived from the Greek word meaning “small.” However, many of 
the individual economic units that we will study are small only in relation to the U.S. economy as a whole. For example, the annual sales of General Motors, IBM, or Microsoft are larger than the gross national products of many countries.4  PART 1   •  Introduction: Markets and Prices
1.1  The Themes of Microeconomics
The Rolling Stones once said: “You can’t always get what you want.” This is 
true. For most people (even Mick Jagger), that there are limits to what you can have or do is a simple fact of life learned in early childhood. For economists, however, it can be an obsession.
Much of microeconomics is about limits —the limited incomes that consumers 
can spend on goods and services, the limited budgets and technical know-how that firms can use to produce things, and the limited number of hours in a week that workers can allocate to labor or leisure. But microeconomics is also about ways to make the most of these limits.  More precisely, it is about the allocation of 
scarce resources.  For example, microeconomics explains how consumers can best 
allocate their limited incomes to the various goods and services available for purchase. It explains how workers can best allocate their time to labor instead of leisure, or to one job instead of another. And it explains how firms can best allocate limited financial resources to hiring additional workers versus buying new machinery, and to producing one set of products versus another.
In a planned economy such as that of Cuba, North Korea, or the former Soviet 
Union, these allocation decisions are made mostly by the government. Firms are told what and how much to produce, and how to produce it; workers have little flexibility in choice of jobs, hours worked, or even where they live; and consum-ers typically have a very limited set of goods to choose from. As a result, many of the tools and concepts of microeconomics are of limited relevance in those countries.
Trade-Offs
In modern market economies, consumers, workers, and firms have much more flexibility and choice when it comes to allocating scarce resources. Microeconomics describes the trade-offs  that consumers, workers, and firms face, 
and shows how these trade-offs are best made.
The idea of making optimal trade-offs is an important theme in micro-
economics—one that you will encounter throughout this book. Let’s look at it in more detail.
CONSUMERS  Consumers have limited incomes, which can be spent on a wide 
variety of goods and services, or saved for the future. Consumer theory , the sub-
ject matter of Chapters 3, 4, and 5 of this book, describes how consumers, based on their preferences, maximize their well-being by trading off the purchase of more of some goods for the purchase of less of others. We will also see how con-sumers decide how much of their incomes to save, thereby trading off current consumption for future consumption.
WORKERS  Workers also face constraints and make trade-offs. First, people 
must decide whether and when to enter the workforce. Because the kinds of jobs—and corresponding pay scales—available to a worker depend in part on educational attainment and accumulated skills, one must trade off work-ing now (and earning an immediate income) for continued education (and the hope of earning a higher future income). Second, workers face trade-offs in their choice of employment. For example, while some people choose to work for large  corporations that offer job security but limited potential for advancement,  others prefer to work for small companies where there is more opportunity for • microeconomics  Branch of 
economics that deals with the behavior of individual economic units—consumers, firms, workers, and investors—as well as the markets that these units comprise.
• macroeconomics  Branch 
of economics that deals with aggregate economic variables, 
such as the level and growth rate 
of national output, interest rates, unemployment, and inflation.CHAPTER 1   •  Preliminaries  5
advancement but less security. Finally, workers must sometimes decide how 
many hours per week they wish to work, thereby trading off labor for leisure.
FIRMS  Firms also face limits in terms of the kinds of products that they can pro-
duce, and the resources available to produce them. General Motors, for exam-ple, is very good at producing cars and trucks, but it does not have the ability to produce airplanes, computers, or pharmaceuticals. It is also constrained in terms of financial resources and the current production capacity of its factories. Given these constraints, GM must decide how many of each type of vehicle to produce. If it wants to produce a larger total number of cars and trucks next year or the year after, it must decide whether to hire more workers, build new factories, or do both. The theory of the firm , the subject matter of Chapters 6 and 
7, describes how these trade-offs can best be made.
Prices and Markets
A second important theme of microeconomics is the role of prices.  All of the 
trade-offs described above are based on the prices faced by consumers, workers, or firms. For example, a consumer trades off beef for chicken based partly on his or her preferences for each one, but also on their prices. Likewise, workers trade off labor for leisure based in part on the “price” that they can get for their labor—i.e., the wage.  And firms decide whether to hire more workers or pur-
chase more machines based in part on wage rates and machine prices.
Microeconomics also describes how prices are determined. In a centrally 
planned economy, prices are set by the government. In a market economy, prices are determined by the interactions of consumers, workers, and firms. These interactions occur in markets —collections of buyers and sellers that together 
determine the price of a good. In the automobile market, for example, car prices are affected by competition among Ford, General Motors, Toyota, and other manufacturers, and also by the demands of consumers. The central role of  markets is the third important theme of microeconomics. We will say more about the nature and operation of markets shortly.
Theories and Models
Like any science, economics is concerned with the explanations  of observed 
 phenomena. Why, for example, do firms tend to hire or lay off workers when the prices of their raw materials change? How many workers are likely to be hired or laid off by a firm or an industry if the price of raw materials increases by, say, 10 percent?
In economics, as in other sciences, explanation and prediction are based on 
theories.  Theories are developed to explain observed phenomena in terms of a set 
of basic rules and assumptions. The theory of the firm , for example, begins with 
a simple assumption—firms try to maximize their profits. The theory uses this assumption to explain how firms choose the amounts of labor, capital, and raw materials that they use for production and the amount of output they produce. It also explains how these choices depend on the prices  of inputs, such as labor, 
capital, and raw materials, and the prices that firms can receive for their outputs.
Economic theories are also the basis for making predictions. Thus the theory 
of the firm tells us whether a firm’s output level will increase or decrease in response to an increase in wage rates or a decrease in the price of raw materi-als. With the application of statistical and econometric techniques, theories can be used to construct models from which quantitative predictions can be made. 6  PART 1   •  Introduction: Markets and Prices
A model  is a mathematical representation, based on economic theory, of a firm, a 
market, or some other entity. For example, we might develop a model of a par-ticular firm and use it to predict by how much  the firm’s output level will change 
as a result of, say, a 10-percent drop in the price of raw materials.
Statistics and econometrics also let us measure the accuracy  of our predictions. 
For example, suppose we predict that a 10-percent drop in the price of raw materi-als will lead to a 5-percent increase in output. Are we sure that the increase in out-put will be exactly 5 percent, or might it be somewhere between 3 and 7 percent? 
Quantifying the accuracy of a prediction can be as important as the prediction itself.
No theory, whether in economics, physics, or any other science, is perfectly 
correct. The usefulness and validity of a theory depend on whether it succeeds in explaining and predicting the set of phenomena that it is intended to explain and predict. Theories, therefore, are continually tested against observation. As a result of this testing, they are often modified or refined and occasionally even discarded. The process of testing and refining theories is central to the develop-ment of economics as a science.
When evaluating a theory, it is important to keep in mind that it is invariably 
imperfect. This is the case in every branch of science. In physics, for example, Boyle’s law relates the volume, temperature, and pressure of a gas.
2 The law is 
based on the assumption that individual molecules of a gas behave as though they were tiny, elastic billiard balls. Physicists today know that gas molecules do not, in fact, always behave like billiard balls, which is why Boyle’s law breaks down under extremes of pressure and temperature. Under most conditions, however, it does an excellent job of predicting how the temperature of a gas will change when the pressure and volume change, and it is therefore an essential tool for engineers and scientists.
The situation is much the same in economics. For example, because firms do 
not maximize their profits all the time, the theory of the firm has had only  limited success in explaining certain aspects of firms’ behavior, such as the timing of  capital investment decisions. Nonetheless, the theory does explain a broad range of phenomena regarding the behavior, growth, and evolution of firms and indus-tries, and has thus become an important tool for managers and  policymakers.
Positive versus Normative Analysis
Microeconomics is concerned with both positive  and normative  questions. Positive 
questions deal with explanation and prediction, normative questions with what ought  to be. Suppose the U.S. government imposes a quota on the import of 
foreign cars. What will happen to the price, production, and sales of cars? What impact will this policy change have on American consumers? On workers in the automobile industry? These questions belong to the realm of positive analysis:  
statements that describe relationships of cause and effect.
Positive analysis is central to microeconomics. As we explained above, 
 theories are developed to explain phenomena, tested against observations, and used to construct models from which predictions are made. The use of eco-nomic theory for prediction is important both for the managers of firms and for public policy. Suppose the federal government is considering raising the tax on gasoline. The change would affect the price of gasoline, consumers’ purchasing • positive analysis  Analysis 
describing relationships of cause and effect.
2Robert Boyle (1627–1691) was a British chemist and physicist who discovered experimentally that 
pressure ( P), volume ( V), and temperature ( T) were related in the following way: PV = RT, where 
R is a constant. Later, physicists derived this relationship as a consequence of the kinetic theory of 
gases, which describes the movement of gas molecules in statistical terms.CHAPTER 1   •  Preliminaries  7
choices for small or large cars, the amount of driving that people do, and so 
on. To plan sensibly, oil companies, automobile companies, producers of auto-mobile parts, and firms in the tourist industry would all need to estimate the impact of the change. Government policymakers would also need quantitative estimates of the effects. They would want to determine the costs imposed on consumers (perhaps broken down by income categories); the effects on profits and employment in the oil, automobile, and tourist industries; and the amount of tax revenue likely to be collected each year.
Sometimes we want to go beyond explanation and prediction to ask such 
questions as “What is best?” This involves normative analysis,  which is also 
important for both managers of firms and those making public policy. Again, consider a new tax on gasoline. Automobile companies would want to deter-mine the best (profit-maximizing) mix of large and small cars to produce once the tax is in place. Specifically, how much money should be invested to make cars more fuel-efficient? For policymakers, the primary issue is likely to be whether the tax is in the public interest. The same policy objectives (say, an increase in tax revenues and a decrease in dependence on imported oil) might be met more cheaply with a different kind of tax, such as a tariff on imported oil.
Normative analysis is not only concerned with alternative policy options; it 
also involves the design of particular policy choices. For example, suppose it has been decided that a gasoline tax is desirable. Balancing costs and benefits, we then ask what is the optimal size of the tax.
Normative analysis is often supplemented by value judgments. For example, 
a comparison between a gasoline tax and an oil import tariff might conclude that the gasoline tax will be easier to administer but will have a greater impact on lower-income consumers. At that point, society must make a value judgment, weighing equity against economic efficiency. When value judgments are involved,  microeconomics cannot tell us what the best policy is. However, it can clarify the trade-offs and thereby help to illuminate the issues and sharpen the debate.
1.2  What Is a Market?
Business people, journalists, politicians, and ordinary consumers talk about markets all the time—for example, oil markets, housing markets, bond markets, labor markets, and markets for all kinds of goods and services. But often what they mean by the word “market” is vague or misleading. In economics, markets are a central focus of analysis, so economists try to be as clear as possible about what they mean when they refer to a market.
It is easiest to understand what a market is and how it works by  dividing 
individual economic units into two broad groups according to function— buyers  
and sellers.  Buyers include consumers, who purchase goods and  services, and 
firms, which buy labor, capital, and raw materials that they use to produce goods and services. Sellers include firms, which sell their goods and services; workers, who sell their labor services; and resource owners, who rent land or sell mineral resources to firms. Clearly, most people and most firms act as both buyers and sellers, but we will find it helpful to think of them as simply buyers when they are buying something and sellers when they are selling something.
Together, buyers and sellers interact to form markets.  A market  is the  collection 
of buyers and sellers that, through their actual or potential interactions, determine the price of a product or set of products.  In the market for personal computers, for 
example, the buyers are business firms, households, and students; the sellers are  • normative analysis  Analysis

• market  Collection of buyers 
and sellers that, through their actual or potential interactions, determine the price of a product or set of products.8  PART 1   •  Introduction: Markets and Prices
Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Dell, Apple, and a number of other firms. Note that a 
market includes more than an industry.  An industry is a collection of firms that sell the 
same or closely related products.  In effect, an industry is the supply side of the market.
Economists are often concerned with market definition —with determining 
which buyers and sellers should be included in a particular market. When defin-ing a market, potential  interactions of buyers and sellers can be just as important 
as actual  ones. An example of this is the market for gold. A New Yorker who 
wants to buy gold is unlikely to travel to Zurich to do so. Most buyers of gold in New York will interact only with sellers in New York. But because the cost of transporting gold is small relative to its value, buyers of gold in New York could  
purchase their gold in Zurich if the prices there were significantly lower.
Significant differences in the price of a commodity create a potential for 
 arbitrage:  buying at a low price in one location and selling at a higher price 
somewhere else. The possibility of arbitrage prevents the prices of gold in New York and Zurich from differing significantly and creates a world market for gold.
Markets are at the center of economic activity, and many of the most interest-
ing issues in economics concern the functioning of markets. For example, why do only a few firms compete with one another in some markets, while in others a great many firms compete? Are consumers necessarily better off if there are many firms? If so, should the government intervene in markets with only a few firms? Why have prices in some markets risen or fallen rapidly, while in other markets prices have hardly changed at all? And which markets offer the best opportunities for an entrepreneur thinking of going into business?
Competitive versus Noncompetitive Markets
In this book, we study the behavior of both competitive and noncompetitive markets. A perfectly competitive market  has many buyers and sellers, so that 
no single buyer or seller has any impact on price. Most agricultural markets are close to being perfectly competitive. For example, thousands of farmers produce wheat, which thousands of buyers purchase to produce flour and other prod-ucts. As a result, no single farmer and no single buyer can significantly affect the price of wheat.
Many other markets are competitive enough to be treated as if they were per-
fectly competitive. The world market for copper, for example, contains a few dozen major producers. That number is enough for the impact on price to be small if any one producer goes out of business. The same is true for many other natural resource markets, such as those for coal, iron, tin, or lumber.
Other markets containing a small number of producers may still be treated 
as competitive for purposes of analysis. For example, the U.S. airline industry contains several dozen firms, but most routes are served by only a few firms. Nonetheless, because competition among those firms is often fierce, for some purposes airline markets can be treated as competitive. Finally, some markets contain many producers but are noncompetitive ; that is, individual firms can 
jointly affect the price. The world oil market is one example. Since the early 1970s, that market has been dominated by the OPEC cartel. (A cartel  is a group 
of producers that acts collectively.)
Market Price
Markets make possible transactions between buyers and sellers. Quantities of a good are sold at specific prices. In a perfectly competitive market, a single price—the market price —will usually prevail. The price of wheat in Kansas • market definition

City and the price of gold in New York are two examples. These prices are usu-
ally easy to measure. For example, you can find the price of corn, wheat, or gold each day in the business section of a newspaper.
In markets that are not perfectly competitive, different firms might charge 
different prices for the same product. This might happen because one firm is trying to win customers from its competitors, or because customers have brand loyalties that allow some firms to charge higher prices than others. For exam-ple, two brands of laundry detergent might be sold in the same supermarket at different prices. Or two supermarkets in the same town might sell the same brand of laundry detergent at different prices. In cases such as this, when we refer to the market price, we will mean the price averaged across brands or supermarkets.
The market prices of most goods will fluctuate over time, and for many goods 
the fluctuations can be rapid. This is particularly true for goods sold in competi-tive markets. The stock market, for example, is highly competitive because there are typically many buyers and sellers for any one stock. As anyone who has invested in the stock market knows, the price of any particular stock fluctuates from minute to minute and can rise or fall substantially during a single day. Likewise, the prices of commodities such as wheat, soybeans, coffee, oil, gold, silver, and lumber can rise or fall dramatically in a day or a week.
Market Definition—The Extent of a Market
As we saw, market definition  identifies which buyers and sellers should be 
included in a given market. However, to determine which buyers and sellers to include, we must first determine the extent of a market —its boundaries , both 
geographically  and in terms of the range of products  to be included in it.
When we refer to the market for gasoline, for example, we must be clear about 
its geographic boundaries. Are we referring to downtown Los Angeles, south-ern California, or the entire United States? We must also be clear about the range of products to which we are referring. Should regular-octane and high-octane premium gasoline be included in the same market? Gasoline and diesel fuel?
For some goods, it makes sense to talk about a market only in terms of very 
restrictive geographic boundaries. Housing is a good example. Most people who work in downtown Chicago will look for housing within commuting dis-tance. They will not look at homes 200 or 300 miles away, even though those homes might be much cheaper. And homes (together with the land they are sitting on) 200 miles away cannot be easily moved closer to Chicago. Thus the housing market in Chicago is separate and distinct from, say, that in Cleveland, Houston, Atlanta, or Philadelphia. Likewise, retail gasoline markets, though less limited geographically, are still regional because of the expense of ship-ping gasoline over long distances. Thus the market for gasoline in southern California is distinct from that in northern Illinois. On the other hand, as we mentioned earlier, gold is bought and sold in a world market; the possibility of arbitrage prevents the price from differing significantly from one location to another.
We must also think carefully about the range of products to include in 
a  market. For example, there is a market for single-lens reflex (SLR) digital  cameras, and many brands compete in that market. But what about compact “point-and-shoot” digital cameras? Should they be considered part of the same market? Probably not, because they are typically used for different purposes and so do not compete with SLR cameras. Gasoline is another example. Regular- and premium-octane gasolines might be considered part of the same market because • extent of a market

geographical and in terms of range of products produced and sold within it.10  PART 1   •  Introduction: Markets and Prices
most consumers can use either. Diesel fuel, however, is not part of this market 
because cars that use regular gasoline cannot use diesel fuel, and vice versa.3
Market definition is important for two reasons:
• A company must understand who its actual and potential competitors are for 
the various products that it sells or might sell in the future. It must also know the product boundaries and geographical boundaries of its market in order to set price, determine advertising budgets, and make capital investment  decisions.
• Market definition can be important for public policy decisions. Should the 
government allow a merger or acquisition involving companies that produce similar products, or should it challenge it? The answer depends on the impact of that merger or acquisition on future competition and prices; often this can be evaluated only by defining a market.
3How can we determine the extent of a market? Since the market is where the price of a good is 
established, one approach focuses on market prices. We ask whether product prices in different geographic regions (or for different product types) are approximately the same, or whether they tend to move together. If either is the case, we place them in the same market. For a more detailed discussion, see George J. Stigler and Robert A. Sherwin, “The Extent of the Market,” Journal of Law 
and Economics  27 (October 1985): 555–85.
4This example is based on F. M. Scherer, “Archer-Daniels-Midland Corn Processing,” Case C16-92-1126, 
John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, 1992.EXAMPLE 1.1  THE MARKET FOR SWEETENERS
In 1990, the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM) 
acquired the Clinton Corn Processing Company (CCP).4 
ADM was a large company that produced many agri-cultural products, one of which was high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). CCP was another major U.S. corn syrup producer. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) chal-lenged the acquisition on the grounds that it would lead to a dominant producer of corn syrup with the power to push prices above competitive levels. Indeed, ADM and CCP together accounted for over 70 percent of U.S. corn syrup production.
ADM fought the DOJ decision, and the case 
went to court. The basic issue was whether corn syrup represented a distinct market. If it did, the combined market share of ADM and CCP would have been about 40 percent, and the DOJ’s  concern 
might have been warranted. ADM, however, argued that the correct market definition was much broader—a market for sweeteners which included sugar as well as corn syrup. Because the ADM–CCP combined share of a sweetener market would have been quite small, there would be no concern about the company’s power to raise prices.
ADM argued that sugar and corn syrup should be 
considered part of the same market because they are used interchangeably to sweeten a vast array of 
food products, such as soft drinks, spaghetti sauce, and pancake syrup. ADM also showed that as the level of prices for corn syrup and sugar fluctuated, industrial food producers would change the propor-tions of each sweetener that they used in their prod-ucts. In October 1990, a federal judge agreed with ADM’s argument that sugar and corn syrup were both part of a broad market for sweeteners. The acquisition was allowed to go through.
Sugar and corn syrup continue to be used almost 
interchangeably to satisfy Americans’ strong taste for sweetened foods. The use of all sweeteners rose steadily through the 1990s, reaching 150 pounds per person in 1999. But starting in 2000, sweetener use began to decline as health concerns led people to find substitute snacks with less added sugar. By 2010, American per-capita consumption of sweet-eners had dropped to 130 pounds per  person. 
In addition, for the first time since 1985, people  consumed more sugar (66 pounds per person) than 
corn syrup (64.5 pounds per person). Part of the shift from corn syrup to sugar was due to a growing belief that sugar is somehow more “natural”—and therefore healthier—than corn syrup.CHAPTER 1   •  Preliminaries  11
EXAMPLE 1.2  A BICYCLE IS A BICYCLE. OR IS IT?
Where did you buy your last bicy-
cle? You might have bought a used bike from a friend or from a posting on Craigslist. But if it was new, you probably bought it from either of two types of stores.
If you were looking for something 
inexpensive, just a functional bicycle to get you from A to B, you would have done well by going to a mass merchandiser such as Target, Wal-Mart, or Sears. There you could  easily 
find a decent bike costing around $100 to $200. On the other hand, if you are a serious cyclist (or at least like to think of yourself as one), you would probably go to a bicycle dealer—a store that specializes in bicycles and bicycle equipment. There it would be difficult to find a bike costing less than $400, and you could easily spend far more. But of course you would have been happy to spend more, because you are serious cyclist.
What does a $1000 Trek bike give you that a 
$120 Huffy bike doesn’t? Both might have 21-speed gear shifts (3 in front and 7 in back), but the shift-ing mechanisms on the Trek will be higher quality and probably shift more smoothly and evenly. Both bikes will have front and rear hand brakes, but the brakes on the Trek will likely be stronger and more durable. And the Trek is likely to have a lighter frame than the Huffy, which could be 
important if you are a competitive cyclist.
So there are actually two differ-
ent markets for bicycles, markets that can be identified by the type of store in which the bicycle is sold. This is illustrated in Table 1.1. “Mass market” bicycles, the ones that are sold in Target and Wal-Mart, are made by companies such as Huffy, Schwinn, and Mantis, are priced as low as $90 and rarely cost more than $250. These companies are focused on producing functional bicycles as cheaply as possible, and typically do 
their manufacturing in China. “Dealer” bicycles, the ones sold in your local bicycle store, include such brands as Trek, Cannondale, Giant, Gary Fisher, and Ridley, and are priced from $400 and up—way up. For these companies the emphasis is on performance, as measured by weight and the quality of the brakes, gears, tires, and other  hardware.
Companies like Huffy and Schwinn would never 
try to produce a $1000 bicycle, because that is simply not their forte (or competitive advantage, as economists like to say). Likewise, Trek and Ridley have developed a reputation for quality, and they have neither the skills nor the factories

1.3  Real versus Nominal Prices
We often want to compare the price of a good today with what it was in the past 
or is likely to be in the future. To make such a comparison meaningful, we need to measure prices relative to an overall price level.  In absolute terms, the price of 
a dozen eggs is many times higher today than it was 50 years ago. Relative to prices overall, however, it is actually lower. Therefore, we must be careful to correct for inflation when comparing prices across time. This means measuring prices in real rather than nominal  terms.
The nominal price  of a good (sometimes called its “current-dollar” price) is 
its absolute price. For example, the nominal price of a pound of butter was about $0.87 in 1970, $1.88 in 1980, about $1.99 in 1990, and about $3.42 in 2010. These are the prices you would have seen in supermarkets in those years. The real price  
of a good (sometimes called its “constant-dollar” price) is the price relative to an aggregate measure of prices. In other words, it is the price adjusted for inflation.
For consumer goods, the aggregate measure of prices most often used is the 
Consumer Price Index (CPI).  The CPI is calculated by the U.S. Bureau of Labor 
Statistics by surveying retail prices, and is published monthly. It records how the cost of a large market basket of goods purchased by a “typical” consumer changes over time. Percentage changes in the CPI measure the rate of inflation in the economy.
Sometimes we are interested in the prices of raw materials and other interme-
diate products bought by firms, as well as in finished products sold at wholesale to retail stores. In this case, the aggregate measure of prices often used is the Producer Price Index (PPI).  The PPI is also calculated by the U.S. Bureau of 
Labor Statistics and published monthly, and records how, on average, prices at the wholesale level change over time. Percentage changes in the PPI measure cost inflation and predict future changes in the CPI.
So which price index should you use to convert nominal prices to real prices? 
It depends on the type of product you are examining. If it is a product or service normally purchased by consumers, use the CPI. If instead it is a product nor-mally purchased by businesses, use the PPI.
Because we are examining the price of butter in supermarkets, the relevant 
price index is the CPI. After correcting for inflation, do we find that the price of butter was more expensive in 2010 than in 1970? To find out, let’s calculate the 2010 price of butter in terms of 1970 dollars. The CPI was 38.8 in 1970 and rose to about 218.1 in 2010. (There was considerable inflation in the United States  during the 1970s and early 1980s.) In 1970 dollars, the price of butter was

it up carefully due to the unfortunate reality of yet another market—the black market for used bikes and their parts. We hope that you—and your bike—stay out of that market!CHAPTER 1   •  Preliminaries  13
EXAMPLE 1.3  THE PRICE OF EGGS AND THE PRICE 
OF A COLLEGE EDUCATION
In 1970, Grade A large eggs cost about 61 cents a dozen. In the same year, 
the average annual cost of a college education at a private four-year college, including room and board, was about $2112. By 2010, the price of eggs had risen to $1.54 a dozen, and the average cost of a college  education was 
$21,550. In real terms, were eggs more expensive in 2010 than in 1970? Had a college education become more expensive?
Table 1.2 shows the nominal price of eggs, the nominal cost of a college 
education, and the CPI for 1970–2010. (The CPI is based on 
1983 =100.)

5Two good sources of data on the national economy are the Economic Report of the President  and the 
Statistical Abstract of the United States.  Both are published annually and are available from the U.S. 
Government Printing Office.In real terms, therefore, the price of butter was lower in 2010 than it was in 1970.5 
Put another way, the nominal price of butter went up by about 293 percent, while the CPI went up 462 percent. Relative to the aggregate price level, butter prices fell.
In this book, we will usually be concerned with real rather than nominal prices 
because consumer choices involve analyses of price comparisons. These relative prices can most easily be evaluated if there is a common basis of comparison. Stating all prices in real terms achieves this objective. Thus, even though we will often measure prices in dollars, we will be thinking in terms of the real purchas-ing power of those dollars.
6You can get data on the cost of a college education by visiting the National Center for Education 
Statistics and download the Digest of Education Statistics at http://nces.ed.gov . Historical and cur-
rent data on the average retail price of eggs can be obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at http://www.bls.gov , by selecting CPI—Average Price Data.14  PART 1   •  Introduction: Markets and Prices
Also shown are the real prices of eggs and college education in 1970  dollars, 
calculated as follows:
Real price of eggs in 1980 = CPI 1970
CPI 1980 * nominal price in 1980
Real price of eggs in 1990 = CPI 1970
CPI 1990 * nominal price in 1990
and so forth.
The table shows clearly that the real cost of a college education rose (by 
82 percent) during this period, while the real cost of eggs fell (by 55 percent). It is these relative changes in prices that are important for the choices that consumers make, not the fact that both eggs and college cost more in nomi-nal dollars today than they did in 1970.
In the table, we calculated real prices in terms of 1970 dollars, but we 
could just as easily have calculated them in terms of dollars of some other base year. For example, suppose we want to  calculate the real price of eggs 
in 1990 dollars.  Then:
 Real price of eggs in 1970 = CPI
1990
CPI 1970 * nominal price in 1970
 =130.7
38.8 *0.61=2.05
 Real price of eggs in 2010 = CPI 1990
CPI 2010 * nominal price in 2010
 =130.7
218.1 *1.54=0.92
 Percentage change in real price = real price in 2010 -real price in 1970
real price in  1970
 =0.92 -2.05
2.05=-0.55
Notice that the percentage decline in real price is the same whether we use 
1970 dollars or 1990 dollars as the base year.CHAPTER 1   •  Preliminaries  15

ple, in 2011 the minimum wage in Massachusetts was $8.00 per hour, in New York it was $7.25, and in California it was $8.00 and scheduled to increase to $8.00 in 2008. You can learn more about the minimum wage at http://www.dol.gov .EXAMPLE 1.4  THE MINIMUM WAGE

at a level of 25 cents per hour—has been increased periodically over the years. From 1991 through 1995, for example, it was $4.25 an hour. Congress voted to raise it to $4.75 in 1996 and then to $5.15 in 1997. Legislation in 2007 to increase the  minimum 
wage yet again would raise it to $6.55 an hour in 2008 and $7.25 in 2009.

Figure 1.1 shows the minimum wage from 1938 
through 2015, both in nominal terms and in 2000 constant dollars. Note that although the legislated minimum wage has steadily increased, in real terms the minimum wage today is not much different from what is was in the 1950s.Nonetheless, the 2007 decision to increase the 
minimum wage was a difficult one. Although the higher minimum wage would provide a better standard of living for those workers who had been paid below the minimum, some analysts feared that it would also lead to increased unemployment among young and unskilled workers. The decision to increase the minimum wage, therefore, raises both normative and positive issues. The  normative 
issue is whether any loss of teenage and low-skilled jobs is outweighed by two factors: (1) the direct benefits to those workers who now earn more as a result; and (2) any indirect benefits to other 
 workers whose wages might be increased along

1.4  Why Study Microeconomics?
We think that after reading this book you will have no doubt about the impor-
tance and broad applicability of microeconomics. In fact, one of our major goals is to show you how to apply microeconomic principles to actual decision-making problems. Nonetheless, some extra motivation early on never hurts. Here are two examples that not only show the use of microeconomics in practice, but also  provide a preview of this book.
Corporate Decision Making: The Toyota Prius
In 1997, Toyota Motor Corporation introduced the Prius in Japan, and started selling it worldwide in 2001. The Prius, the first hybrid car to be sold in the United States, can run off both a gasoline engine and a battery, and the momen-tum of the car charges the battery. Hybrid cars are more energy efficient than cars with just a gasoline engine; the Prius, for example, can get 45 to 55 miles per gallon. The Prius was a big success, and within a few years other manufacturers began introducing hybrid versions of some of their cars.
The design and efficient production of the Prius involved not only some 
impressive engineering, but a lot of economics as well. First, Toyota had to think carefully about how the public would react to the design and performance of this new product. How strong would demand be initially, and how fast would it grow? How would demand depend on the prices that Toyota charged? Understanding consumer preferences and trade-offs and predicting demand and its responsive-ness to price are essential to Toyota and every other automobile manufacturer. (We discuss consumer preferences and demand in Chapters 3, 4, and 5.)
Next, Toyota had to be concerned with the cost of manufacturing these cars — 
whether produced in Japan or, starting in 2010, in the United States. How high would production costs be? How would the cost of each car depend on the total number of cars produced each year? How would the cost of labor and the prices of steel and other raw materials affect costs? How much and how fast would costs decline as managers and workers gained experience with the production with the wages of those at the bottom of the pay scale.
An important positive issue is how many fewer 
workers (if any) would be able to get jobs with a higher minimum wage. As we will see in Chapter 14, this issue is still hotly debated. Statistical studies have suggested that an increase in the  minimum wage of about 10 percent would increase teen-
age  unemployment by 1 to 2 percent. (The actual 
increase from $5.15 to $7.25 represents a 41- percent 
increase.) However, one review of the evidence questions whether there are any significant unem-ployment effects.

Press, 1995).CHAPTER 1   •  Preliminaries  17
process? And to maximize profits, how many of these cars should Toyota plan to 
produce each year? (We discuss production and cost in Chapters 6 and 7, and the profit-maximizing choice of output in Chapters 8 and 10.)
Toyota also had to design a pricing strategy and consider how competitors 
would react to it. Although the Prius was the first hybrid car, Toyota knew that it would compete with other small fuel-efficient cars, and that soon other  manufacturers would introduce their own hybrid cars. Should Toyota charge a relatively low price for a basic stripped-down version of the Prius and high prices for individual options like leather seats? Or would it be more profitable to make these options “standard” items and charge a higher price for the whole package? Whatever pricing strategy Toyota chose, how were competitors likely to react? Would Ford or Nissan try to undercut by lowering the prices of its smaller cars, or rush to bring out their own hybrid cars at lower prices? Might Toyota be able to deter Ford and Nissan from lowering prices by threatening to respond with its own price cuts? (We discuss pricing in Chapters 10 and 11, and competitive strategy in Chapters 12 and 13.)
Manufacturing the Prius required large investments in new capital equipment, 
so Toyota had to consider both the risks and possible outcomes of its decisions. Some of this risk was due to uncertainty over the future price of oil and thus the price of gasoline (lower gasoline prices would reduce the demand for small fuel-efficient cars). Some of the risk was due to uncertainty over the wages that Toyota would have to pay its workers at its plants in Japan and in the United States. (Oil and other commodity markets are discussed in Chapters 2 and 9. Labor markets and the impact of unions are discussed in Chapter 14. Investment decisions and the implications of uncertainty are discussed in Chapters 5 and 15.)
Toyota also had to worry about organizational problems. Toyota is an inte-
grated firm in which separate divisions produce engines and parts and then assemble finished cars. How should the managers of different divisions be rewarded? What price should the assembly division be charged for the engines it receives from another division? (We discuss internal pricing and organiza-tional incentives for the integrated firm in Chapters 11 and 17.)
Finally, Toyota had to think about its relationship to the government and the 
effects of regulatory policies. For example, all of its cars sold in the United States must meet federal emissions standards, and U.S. production-line operations must comply with health and safety regulations. How might those regulations and standards change over time? How would they affect costs and profits? (We discuss the role of government in limiting pollution and promoting health and safety in Chapter 18.)
Public Policy Design: Fuel Efficiency Standards for the 
Twenty-First Century
In 1975, the U.S. government imposed regulations designed to improve the 
average fuel economy of domestically-sold cars and light trucks (including vans and sport utility vehicles). The CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) standards have become increasingly stringent over the years. In 2007, President George W. Bush signed into law the Energy Independence and Security Act, which required automakers to boost fleet wide gas mileage to 35 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2020. In 2011, the Obama administration pushed the 35 mpg target forward to 2016, and (with the agreement of 13 auto companies) set a standard of 55 mpg for 2020. While the program’s primary goal is to increase 18  PART 1   •  Introduction: Markets and Prices
SUMMARY
 1. Microeconomics is concerned with the decisions made 
by individual economic units—consumers, workers, investors, owners of resources, and business firms. It is also concerned with the interaction of consumers and firms to form markets and industries.
 2. Microeconomics relies heavily on the use of theory, 
which can (by simplification) help to explain how eco-nomic units behave and to predict what behavior will occur in the future. Models are mathematical represen-tations of theories that can help in this explanation and prediction process. 3. Microeconomics is concerned with positive questions 
that have to do with the explanation and prediction of phenomena. But microeconomics is also important for normative analysis, in which we ask what choices are best—for a firm or for society as a whole. Normative analyses must often be combined with individual value judgments because issues of equity and fairness as well as of economic efficiency may be involved.
 4. A market  refers to a collection of buyers and sell-
ers who interact, and to the possibility for sales and purchases that result from that interaction. energy  security by reducing the U.S. dependence on imported oil, it would also 
generate substantial  environmental benefits, such as a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
A number of important decisions have to be made when designing a fuel 
efficiency program, and most of those decisions involve economics. First, the government must evaluate the monetary impact of the program on consumers. Higher fuel economy standards will increase the cost of purchasing a car (the cost of achieving higher fuel economy will be borne in part by consumers), but will lower the cost of operating it (gas mileage will be higher). Analyzing the ulti-mate impact on consumers means analyzing consumer preferences and demand. For example, would consumers drive less and spend more of their income on other goods? If so, would they be nearly as well off? (Consumer preferences and demand are discussed in Chapters 3 and 4).
Before imposing CAFE standards, it is important to estimate the likely 
impact those standards will have on the cost of producing cars and light trucks. Might automobile companies minimize cost increases by using new light-weight materials or by changing the footprint of new model cars? (Production and cost are discussed in Chapters 6 and 7.) Then the government needs to know how changes in production costs will affect the production levels and prices of new automobiles and light trucks. Are the additional costs likely to be absorbed by manufacturers or passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices? (Output determination is discussed in Chapter 8 and pricing in Chapters 10 through 13.)
The government must also ask why problems related to oil consumption are 
not solved by our market-oriented economy. One answer is that oil prices are determined in part by a cartel (OPEC) that is able to push the price of oil above competitive levels. (Pricing in markets in which firms have the power to control prices are discussed in Chapters 10 through 12.) Finally, the high U.S. demand for oil has led to a substantial outflow of dollars to the oil-producing countries, which in turn has created political and security issues that go beyond the con-fines of economics. What economics can do, however, is help us evaluate how best to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Are standards like those of the CAFE program preferred to fees on oil consumption? What are the environ-mental implications of increasingly stringent standards? (These problems are  discussed in Chapter 18.)
These are just two examples of how microeconomics can be applied in the 
arenas of private and public-policy decision making. You will discover many more applications as you read this book.CHAPTER 1   •  Preliminaries  19
QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW
 1. It is often said that a good theory is one that can be 
refuted by an empirical, data-oriented study. Explain why a theory that cannot be evaluated empirically is not a good theory.
 2. Which of the following two statements involves posi-
tive economic analysis and which normative? How do the two kinds of analysis differ?
 a. Gasoline rationing (allocating to each individual 
a maximum amount of gasoline that can be pur-chased each year) is poor social policy because it interferes with the workings of the competitive market system.
 b. Gasoline rationing is a policy under which more 
people are made worse off than are made better off.
 3. Suppose the price of regular-octane gasoline were 
20 cents per gallon higher in New Jersey than in Oklahoma. Do you think there would be an oppor-tunity for arbitrage (i.e., that firms could buy gas in Oklahoma and then sell it at a profit in New Jersey)? 
Why or why not?
 4. In Example 1.3, what economic forces explain why the 
real price of eggs has fallen while the real price of a col-lege education has increased? How have these changes affected consumer choices?
 5. Suppose that the Japanese yen rises against the U.S. 
dollar—that is, it will take more dollars to buy a given amount of Japanese yen. Explain why this increase simultaneously increases the real price of Japanese cars for U.S. consumers and lowers the real price of U.S. automobiles for Japanese consumers.
 6. The price of long-distance telephone service fell from 
40 cents per minute in 1996 to 22 cents per minute in 1999, a 45-percent (18 cents/40 cents) decrease. The Consumer Price Index increased by 10 percent over this period. What happened to the real price of tele-phone service?Microeconomics involves the study of both perfectly competitive  markets, in which no single buyer or seller has an impact on price, and noncompetitive markets, in which individual entities can affect price.
 5. The market price is established by the interaction of 
buyers and sellers. In a perfectly competitive market, a single price will usually prevail. In markets that are not perfectly competitive, different sellers might charge different prices. In this case, the market price refers to the average prevailing price. 6. When discussing a market, we must be clear about 
its extent in terms of both its geographic boundaries and the range of products to be included in it. Some markets (e.g., housing) are highly localized, whereas  others (e.g., gold) are global in nature.
 7. To account for the effects of inflation, we measure 
real (or constant-dollar) prices, rather than nomi-nal (or current-dollar) prices. Real prices use an aggregate price index, such as the CPI, to correct for  inflation.
EXERCISES
 1. Decide whether each of the following statements is 
true or false and explain why:
 a. Fast-food chains like McDonald’s, Burger King, 
and Wendy’s operate all over the United States. Therefore, the market for fast food is a national market.
 b. People generally buy clothing in the city in which 
they live. Therefore, there is a clothing market in, say, Atlanta that is distinct from the clothing market in Los Angeles.
 c. Some consumers strongly prefer Pepsi and some 
strongly prefer Coke. Therefore, there is no single market for colas.

is to begin with the basics of supply and demand. Supply-demand analysis is a fundamental and powerful tool that can 
be applied to a wide variety of interesting and important problems. To name a few:
• Understanding and predicting how changing world economic con-
ditions affect market price and production
• Evaluating the impact of government price controls, minimum 
wages, price supports, and production incentives
• Determining how taxes, subsidies, tariffs, and import quotas affect 
consumers and producers
We begin with a review of how supply and demand curves are used 
to describe the market mechanism . Without government intervention 
(e.g., through the imposition of price controls or some other regulatory policy), supply and demand will come into equilibrium to determine both the market price of a good and the total quantity produced. What that price and quantity will be depends on the particular characteris-tics of supply and demand. Variations of price and quantity over time depend on the ways in which supply and demand respond to other economic variables, such as aggregate economic activity and labor costs, which are themselves changing.
We will, therefore, discuss the characteristics of supply and demand 
and show how those characteristics may differ from one market to another. Then we can begin to use supply and demand curves to understand a variety of phenomena—for example, why the prices of some basic commodities have fallen steadily over a long period while the prices of others have experienced sharp fluctuations; why short-ages occur in certain markets; and why announcements about plans for future government policies or predictions about future economic conditions can affect markets well before those policies or conditions become reality.
Besides understanding qualitatively  how market price and quantity 
are determined and how they can vary over time, it is also important  
to learn how they can be analyzed quantitatively . We will see how simple 
“back of the envelope” calculations can be used to analyze and predict evolving market conditions. We will also show how markets respond The Basics of Supply

both to domestic and international macroeconomic fluctuations and to the 
effects of government interventions. We will try to convey this understanding through simple examples and by urging you to work through some exercises at the end of the chapter.
2.1  Supply and Demand
The basic model of supply and demand is the workhorse of microeconomics. It helps us understand why and how prices change, and what happens when the government intervenes in a market. The supply-demand model combines two important concepts: a supply curve  and a demand curve . It is important to under-
stand precisely what these curves represent.
The Supply Curve
The supply curve  shows the quantity of a good that producers are willing to sell 
at a given price, holding constant any other factors that might affect the quantity supplied. The curve labeled S in Figure 2.1 illustrates this. The vertical axis of the 
graph shows the price of a good, P, measured in dollars per unit. This is the price 
that sellers receive for a given quantity supplied. The horizontal axis shows the total quantity supplied, Q, measured in the number of units per period.
The supply curve is thus a relationship between the quantity supplied and 
the price. We can write this relationship as an equation:
Q
S=QS(P)
Or we can draw it graphically, as we have done in Figure 2.1.
Note that the supply curve in Figure 2.1 slopes upward. In other words, the 
higher the price, the more that firms are able and willing to produce and sell . For 
example, a higher price may enable current firms to expand production by hir-ing extra workers or by having existing workers work overtime (at greater cost to the firm). Likewise, they may expand production over a longer period of time by increasing the size of their plants. A higher price may also attract new • supply curve  Relationship 
between the quantity of a good that producers are willing to sell 
and the price of the good.
FIGURE 2.1
THE SUPPLY CURVE
The supply curve, labeled S in the figure, shows how the quan-
tity of a good offered for sale changes as the price of the good changes. The supply curve is upward sloping: The higher the price, the more firms are able and willing to produce and sell. If production costs fall, firms can produce the same quantity at a lower price or a larger quantity at the same price. The supply curve then shifts to the right (from S to S’).

firms to the market. These newcomers face higher costs because of their inex-
perience in the market and would therefore have found entry uneconomical at a lower price.
OTHER VARIABLES THAT AFFECT SUPPLY  The quantity supplied can 
depend on other variables besides price. For example, the quantity that produc-ers are willing to sell depends not only on the price they receive but also on their production costs, including wages, interest charges, and the costs of raw materi-als. The supply curve labeled S in Figure 2.1 was drawn for particular values of 
these other variables. A change in the values of one or more of these variables translates into a shift in the supply curve. Let’s see how this might happen.
The supply curve S in Figure 2.1 says that at a price P
1, the quantity produced 
and sold would be Q1. Now suppose that the cost of raw materials falls. How 
does this affect the supply curve?
Lower raw material costs—indeed, lower costs of any kind—make production 
more profitable, encouraging existing firms to expand production and enabling new firms to enter the market. If at the same time the market price stayed con-stant at P
1, we would expect to observe a greater quantity supplied. Figure 2.1 
shows this as an increase from Q1 to Q2. When production costs decrease , output 
increases  no matter what the market price happens to be. The entire supply curve 
thus shifts to the right , which is shown in the figure as a shift from S to S’.
Another way of looking at the effect of lower raw material costs is to imag-
ine that the quantity produced stays fixed at Q1 and then ask what price firms 
would require to produce this quantity. Because their costs are lower, they would accept a lower price— P
2. This would be the case no matter what quantity 
was produced. Again, we see in Figure 2.1 that the supply curve must shift to the right.
We have seen that the response of quantity supplied to changes in price can 
be represented by movements along the supply curve . However, the response of 
supply to changes in other supply-determining variables is shown graphically as a shift of the supply curve itself . To distinguish between these two graphical 
depictions of supply changes, economists often use the phrase change in supply  
to refer to shifts in the supply curve, while reserving the phrase change in the 
quantity supplied  to apply to movements along the supply curve.
The Demand Curve
The demand curve  shows how much of a good consumers are willing to buy 
as the price per unit changes. We can write this relationship between quantity demanded and price as an equation:
Q
D=QD(P)
or we can draw it graphically, as in Figure 2.2. Note that the demand curve in 
that figure, labeled D, slopes downward : Consumers are usually ready to buy 
more if the price is lower. For example, a lower price may encourage consumers who have already been buying the good to consume larger quantities. Likewise, it may allow other consumers who were previously unable to afford the good to begin buying it.
Of course the quantity of a good that consumers are willing to buy can 
depend on other things besides its price. Income  is especially important. With 
greater incomes, consumers can spend more money on any good, and some con-sumers will do so for most goods.• demand curve  Relationship 
between the quantity of a good that consumers are willing to buy and the price of the good.24  PART 1   •  Introduction: Markets and Prices
SHIFTING THE DEMAND CURVE  Let’s see what happens to the demand 
curve if income levels increase. As you can see in Figure 2.2, if the market price were held constant at P
1, we would expect to see an increase in the quan-
tity demanded—say, from Q1 to Q2, as a result of consumers’ higher incomes. 
Because this increase would occur no matter what the market price, the result would be a shift to the right of the entire demand curve . In the figure, this is shown 
as a shift from D to D’. Alternatively, we can ask what price consumers would 
pay to purchase a given quantity Q
1. With greater income, they should be will-
ing to pay a higher price—say, P2 instead of P1 in Figure 2.2. Again, the demand 
curve will shift to the right . As we did with supply, we will use the phrase change in 
demand  to refer to shifts in the demand curve, and reserve the phrase change in the 
quantity demanded  to apply to movements along the demand curve.1
SUBSTITUTE AND COMPLEMENTARY GOODS  Changes in the prices of 
related goods also affect demand. Goods are substitutes  when an increase in 
the price of one leads to an increase in the quantity demanded of the other. For example, copper and aluminum are substitute goods. Because one can often be substituted for the other in industrial use, the quantity of copper demanded will 
increase if the price of aluminum increases . Likewise, beef and chicken are substi-
tute goods because most consumers are willing to shift their purchases from one to the other when prices change.
Goods are complements  when an increase in the price of one leads to a decrease 
in the quantity demanded of the other. For example, automobiles and gasoline are complementary goods. Because they tend to be used together, a decrease in the price of gasoline increases the quantity demanded for automobiles. Likewise, computers and computer software are complementary goods. The price of com-puters has dropped dramatically over the past decade, fueling an increase not only in purchases of computers, but also purchases of software packages.
We attributed the shift to the right of the demand curve in Figure 2.2 to an 
increase in income. However, this shift could also have resulted from either an increase in the price of a substitute good or a decrease in the price of a • substitutes  Two goods for 
which an increase in the price of one leads to an increase in the quantity demanded of the other.
• complements  Two goods 
for which an increase in the price of one leads to a decrease in the quantity demanded of the other.
1Mathematically, we can write the demand curve as
QD=D(P, I)
where I is disposable income. When we draw a demand curve, we are keeping I fixed.FIGURE 2.2
THE DEMAND CURVE
The demand curve, labeled D, shows how the quantity of a good 
demanded by consumers depends on its price. The demand curve is downward sloping; holding other things equal, consum-ers will want to purchase more of a good as its price goes down. The quantity demanded may also depend on other variables, such as income, the weather, and the prices of other goods. For most products, the quantity demanded increases when income rises. A higher income level shifts the demand curve to the right (from D to D’).P2

complementary good. Or it might have resulted from a change in some other 
variable, such as the weather. For example, demand curves for skis and snow-boards will shift to the right when there are heavy snowfalls.
2.2  The Market Mechanism
The next step is to put the supply curve and the demand curve together. We have done this in Figure 2.3. The vertical axis shows the price of a good, P, again 
measured in dollars per unit. This is now the price that sellers receive for a given quantity supplied, and the price that buyers will pay for a given quantity demanded. The horizontal axis shows the total quantity demanded and sup-plied, Q, measured in number of units per period.
EQUILIBRIUM The two curves intersect at the equilibrium,  or market-clear-
ing, price  and quantity. At this price ( P
0 in Figure 2.3), the quantity supplied 
and the quantity demanded are just equal (to Q0). The market mechanism  is 
the tendency in a free market for the price to change until the market clears —
i.e., until the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are equal. At this point, because there is neither excess demand nor excess supply, there is no pressure for the price to change further. Supply and demand might not always be in equilibrium, and some markets might not clear quickly when conditions change suddenly. The tendency , however, is for markets to clear.
To understand why markets tend to clear, suppose the price were initially 
above the market-clearing level—say, P
1 in Figure 2.3. Producers will try to pro-
duce and sell more than consumers are willing to buy. A surplus —a situation 
in which the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded—will result. To sell this surplus—or at least to prevent it from growing—producers would begin to lower prices. Eventually, as price fell, quantity demanded would increase, and quantity supplied would decrease until the equilibrium price P
0 
was reached.
The opposite would happen if the price were initially below P0—say, at P2.

they would like. This would put upward pressure on price as consumers tried to outbid one another for existing supplies and producers reacted by increasing price and expanding output. Again, the price would eventually reach P

WHEN CAN WE USE THE SUPPLY-DEMAND MODEL?  When we draw and 
use supply and demand curves, we are assuming that at any given price, a given quantity will be produced and sold. This assumption makes sense only if a market is at least roughly competitive . By this we mean that both sellers and 
buyers should have little market power —i.e., little ability individually  to affect the 
market price.
Suppose instead that supply were controlled by a single producer—a monop-
olist. In this case, there will no longer be a simple one-to-one relationship between price and the quantity supplied. Why? Because a monopolist’s behav-ior depends on the shape and position of the demand curve. If the demand curve shifts in a particular way, it may be in the monopolist’s interest to keep the quantity fixed but change the price, or to keep the price fixed and change the quantity. (How this could occur is explained in Chapter 10.) Thus when we work with supply and demand curves, we implicitly assume that we are refer-ring to a competitive market.
2.3   Changes in Market Equilibrium
We have seen how supply and demand curves shift in response to changes in such variables as wage rates, capital costs, and income. We have also seen how the market mechanism results in an equilibrium in which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. Now we will see how that equilib-rium changes in response to shifts in the supply and demand curves.
Let’s begin with a shift in the supply curve. In Figure 2.4, the supply curve 
has shifted from S to S’ (as it did in Figure 2.1), perhaps as a result of a decrease 
in the price of raw materials. As a result, the market price drops (from P
1 to 
P3), and the total quantity produced increases (from Q1 to Q3). This is what we

would expect: Lower costs result in lower prices and increased sales. (Indeed, 
gradual decreases in costs resulting from technological progress and better management are an important driving force behind economic growth.)
Figure 2.5 shows what happens following a rightward shift in the demand 
curve resulting from, say, an increase in income. A new price and quan-tity result after demand comes into equilibrium with supply. As shown in Figure 2.5, we would expect to see consumers pay a higher price, P
3, and 
firms produce a greater quantity, Q3, as a result of an increase in income.
In most markets, both the demand and supply curves shift from time to 
time. Consumers’ disposable incomes change as the economy grows (or con-tracts, during economic recessions). The demands for some goods shift with the seasons (e.g., fuels, bathing suits, umbrellas), with changes in the prices of related goods (an increase in oil prices increases the demand for natural gas), or simply with changing tastes. Similarly, wage rates, capital costs, and the prices of raw materials also change from time to time, and these changes shift the supply curve.
Supply and demand curves can be used to trace the effects of these changes. 
In Figure 2.6, for example, shifts to the right of both supply and demand result in a slightly higher price (from P
1 to P2) and a much larger quantity (from Q1 to 
Q2). In general, price and quantity will change depending both on how much 
the supply and demand curves shift and on the shapes of those curves. To predict the sizes and directions of such changes, we must be able to character-ize  quantitatively the dependence of supply and demand on price and other  variables. We will turn to this task in the next section.

Supply and demand curves shift over time as market 
 conditions change. In this example, rightward shifts of the 
supply and demand curves lead to a slightly higher price and a much larger quantity. In general, changes in price and  quantity depend on the amount by which each curve shifts 
and the shape of each curve.28  PART 1   •  Introduction: Markets and Prices

EDUCATION REVISITED
In Example 1.3 (page 13), we saw 
that from 1970 to 2010, the real (constant-dollar) price of eggs fell by 55 percent, while the real price of a college education rose by 82 percent. What caused this large decline in egg prices and large increase in the price of  college?
We can understand these price 
changes by examining the behavior of supply and demand for each good, as shown in Figure 2.7. For eggs, the mechanization of poultry farms sharply reduced the cost of producing eggs, shifting the sup-ply curve downward. At the same time, the demand curve for eggs shifted to the left as a more health-conscious population changed its eating habits and tended to avoid eggs. As a result, the real price of eggs declined sharply while total 
annual consumption increased (from 5300 million dozen to 6392 million dozen).
As for college, supply and 
demand shifted in the opposite directions. Increases in the costs of equipping and maintaining modern classrooms, laboratories, and libraries, along with increases 
in faculty salaries, pushed the supply curve up. At the same time, the demand curve shifted to the right as a larger percentage of a growing number of high school graduates decided that a college edu-cation was essential. Thus, despite the increase in price, 2010 found 12.5 million students enrolled in four-year undergraduate college degree programs, compared with 6.9 million in 1970.

As a result, both price and enrollments rose sharply.CHAPTER 2   •  The Basics of Supply and Demand  29
EXAMPLE 2.3  THE LONG-RUN BEHAVIOR OF NATURAL 
RESOURCE PRICES
Many people are concerned about 
the earth’s natural resources. At issue is whether our energy and mineral resources are likely to be depleted in the near future, leading to sharp price increases that could bring an end to economic growth. An analysis of supply and demand can give us some perspective.The earth does indeed have 
only a finite amount of mineral resources, such as copper, iron, coal, and oil. During the past cen-tury, however, the prices of these and most other natural resources have declined or remained roughly constant relative to over-all prices. Figure 2.8, for example, 
EXAMPLE 2.2  WAGE INEQUALITY IN THE UNITED STATES
Although the U.S. economy has grown vigorously over the past two decades, the gains from this growth have not been shared equally by all. The wages of skilled high-income workers have grown substantially, while the wages of unskilled low-income workers have, in real terms, actually fallen slightly. Overall, there has been growing inequality in the distribution of earnings, a phenomenon which began around 1980 and has accelerated in recent years. For example, from 1978 to 2009, people in the top 20 percent of the income distribution expe-rienced an increase in their average real (inflation-adjusted) pretax household income of 45 percent, while those in the bottom 20 percent saw their aver-age real pretax income increase by only 4 percent.
2
Why has income distribution become so much 
more unequal during the past two decades? The answer is in the supply and demand for workers. While the supply of unskilled workers—people with limited educations—has grown substantially, the demand for them has risen only slightly. This shift of the supply curve to the right, combined with little movement of the demand curve, has caused wages of unskilled workers to fall. On the other hand, while the supply of skilled workers—e.g., engineers, 
 scientists, managers, and economists—has grown 
slowly, the demand has risen dramatically, pushing wages up. (We leave it to you as an exercise to draw supply and demand curves and show how they have shifted, as was done in Example 2.1.)
These trends are evident in the behavior of 
wages for different categories of employment. From 1980 to 2009, for example, the real (inflation-adjusted) weekly earnings of skilled workers (such as finance, insurance, and real estate workers) rose by more than 20 percent. Over the same period, the weekly real incomes of relatively unskilled workers (such as retail trade workers) rose by only 5 percent.
3
Most projections point to a continuation of this 
phenomenon during the coming decade. As the high-tech sectors of the American economy grow, the demand for highly skilled workers is likely to increase further. At the same time, the computer-ization of offices and factories will further reduce the demand for unskilled workers. (This trend is dis-cussed further in Example 14.7.) These changes can only exacerbate wage inequality.
2In after-tax  terms, the growth of inequality has been even greater; the average real after-tax income 
of the bottom 20 percent of the distribution fell over this period. For historical data on income 
inequality in the United States, see the Historical Income Inequality Tables at the U.S. Census Bureau Web site: http://www.census.gov/ .

shows the price of copper in real terms (adjusted 
for inflation), together with the quantity consumed from 1880 to 2010. (Both are shown as an index, with 1880 = 1.) Despite short-term variations in price, no significant long-term increase has occurred, even though annual consumption is now about 100 times greater than in 1880. Similar patterns hold for other mineral resources, such as iron, oil, and coal.

How can we explain this huge increase in cop-
per consumption but very little change in price? The answer is shown graphically in Figure 2.9. As 
you can see from that figure, the demands for these resources grew along with the world economy. But as demand grew, production costs fell. The decline in costs was due, first, to the discovery of new and bigger deposits that were cheaper to mine, and then to technical progress and the economic advantage of mining and refining on a large scale. As a result, the supply curve shifted over time to the right. Over the long term, because increases in supply were

EXAMPLE 2.4  THE EFFECTS OF 9/11 ON THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND 
FOR NEW YORK CITY OFFICE SPACE
The September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the 
World Trade Center (WTC) complex damaged or destroyed 21 buildings, accounting for 31.2 million square feet (msf) of Manhattan office space—nearly 10 percent of the city’s entire inventory. Just prior to the attack, the Manhattan office vacancy rate was 8.0 percent, and the average asking rent was $52.50 per square foot (psf). Given the huge unexpected reduction in the quantity of office space supplied, we might expect the equilibrium rental price of office space to increase and, as a result, the equi-librium quantity of rented office space to decrease. And because it takes time to construct new office buildings and restore damaged ones, we might also expect the vacancy rate to decline sharply.
Surprisingly, however, the vacancy rate in 
Manhattan increased  from 8.0 percent in August 2001 to 9.3 percent in November 2001. Moreover, 
the average rental price fell from $52.50 to $50.75 
per square foot. In downtown Manhattan, the loca-tion of the Trade Center, the changes were even more dramatic: The vacancy rate rose from 7.5 per-cent to 10.6 percent, and the average rental price fell nearly 8 percent, to $41.81. What happened? Rental prices fell because the demand for office space fell.
Figure 2.10 describes the market for office 
space in downtown Manhattan. The supply and  
demand curves before 9/11 appear as S
Aug and DAug. 
The equilibrium price and quantity of downtown Manhattan office space were $45.34 psf and 76.4 msf, respectively. The reduction in supply from August until November is indicated by a leftward shift in the supply curve (from S
Aug to S’Nov); the 
result is a higher equilibrium price P’ and a lower Price

greater than increases in demand, price often fell, as 
shown in Figure 2.9.
This is not to say that the prices of copper, 
iron, and coal will decline or remain constant for-ever. After all, these resources are finite . But as 
prices begin to rise, consumption will likely shift, at least in part, to substitute materials. Copper, 
for example, has already been replaced in many applications by aluminum and, more recently, in electronic applications by fiber optics. (See Example 2.8 for a more detailed discussion of copper prices.)FIGURE 2.9

OF  SUPPLY AND DEMAND 
FOR  MINERAL RESOURCES
Although demand for most re-
sources has increased dramati-cally over the past century,  prices 
have fallen or risen only slightly in real (inflation-adjusted) terms because cost  reductions have 
shifted the supply curve to the right just as dramatically.32  PART 1   •  Introduction: Markets and Prices

on New York City,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Economic Policy Review , November, 2002.

Business Districts? Lessons from the Office Real Estate Market in Downtown Chicago,” National Bureau of Economic Research, Working Paper 12678, November, 2006.equilibrium quantity, Q’. This is the outcome that 
most forecasters predicted for the months follow-ing September 11.
Many forecasters, however, failed to predict the 
significant decrease  in demand for office space 
complementing the loss in supply. First, many firms, both displaced and non-displaced, chose not to relocate downtown because of quality-of-life concerns (i.e., the WTC ruins, pollution, disabled transportation, and aging inventory). Firms dis-placed by the attack were also forced to reevalu-ate their office-space needs, and they ultimately repurchased a little more than 50 percent of their original office space in Manhattan. Others left Manhattan but stayed in New York City; still oth-ers moved to New Jersey.
5 Furthermore, in late 
2001, the U.S. economy was experiencing an eco-nomic slowdown (exacerbated by the events of September 11) that  further reduced the demand for 
office space. Therefore, the cumulative decrease in demand (a shift from D
Aug to D’Nov) actually caused 
the average rental price of downtown Manhattan office space to decrease rather than increase in the months  following September 11. By November, even though the price had fallen to $41.81, there 
were 57.2 msf on the market.
There is evidence that office real estate mar-
kets in other major U.S. cities experienced simi-lar surges in vacancy rates following 9/11. For instance, in Chicago, not only did vacancy rates increase in downtown office buildings, this increase was  significantly more pronounced in properties 
in or near landmark buildings that are considered  preferred targets for terrorist attacks.

The Manhattan commercial real estate market 
bounced back strongly after 2001. In 2007, the office vacancy rate in Manhattan was 5.8 percent, its lowest figure since 9/11 and the average asking rent was over $74 psf. By May 2009, the vacancy rate had risen above 13 percent. Financial services firms occupy more than a quarter of Manhattan office space, and with the financial crisis came a slump in commercial real estate. Goldman Sachs, for exam-ple, vacated more than 1 million square feet of office space. On the supply side, the new skyscraper at the northwest corner of the World Trade Center site will add 2.6 million square feet of office space upon completion.Price

2.4  Elasticities of Supply and Demand
We have seen that the demand for a good depends not only on its price, but 
also on consumer income and on the prices of other goods. Likewise, supply depends both on price and on variables that affect production cost. For example, if the price of coffee increases, the quantity demanded will fall and the quantity supplied will rise. Often, however, we want to know how much  the quantity sup-
plied or demanded will rise or fall. How sensitive is the demand for coffee to its price? If price increases by 10 percent, how much will the quantity demanded change? How much will it change if income rises by 5 percent? We use elasticities  
to answer questions like these.
An elasticity  measures the sensitivity of one variable to another. Specifically, 
it is a number that tells us the percentage change that will occur in one variable in 
response to a 1-percent increase in another variable . For example, the price elasticity of 
demand  measures the sensitivity of quantity demanded to price changes. It tells 
us what the percentage change in the quantity demanded for a good will be fol-lowing a 1-percent increase in the price of that good.
PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND  Let’s look at this in more detail. We write the 
price elasticity of demand,  E
p, as
Ep=(,/H9004Q)/(,/H9004P)
where % /H9004Q means “percentage change in quantity demanded” and % /H9004P means 
“percentage change in price.” (The symbol /H9004 is the Greek capital letter delta ; it 
means “the change in.” So /H9004X means “the change in the variable X,” say, from 
one year to the next.) The percentage change in a variable is just the absolute change 
in the variable divided by the original level of the variable . (If the Consumer Price Index 
were 200 at the beginning of the year and increased to 204 by the end of the year, the percentage change—or annual rate of inflation—would be 
4/200 =.02, or 
2 percent.) Thus we can also write the price elasticity of demand as follows:7
 Ep=/H9004Q/Q
/H9004P/P=P /H9004Q
Q /H9004P (2.1)
The price elasticity of demand is usually a negative number. When the price 
of a good increases, the quantity demanded usually falls. Thus /H9004Q//H9004P (the 
change in quantity for a change in price) is negative, as is Ep. Sometimes we 
refer to the magnitude  of the price elasticity—i.e., its absolute size. For example, 
if Ep=-2, we say that the elasticity is 2 in magnitude.
When the price elasticity is greater than 1 in magnitude, we say that demand is 
price elastic  because the percentage decline in quantity demanded is greater than 
the percentage increase in price. If the price elasticity is less than 1 in magnitude, demand is said to be price inelastic . In general, the price elasticity of demand for 
a good depends on the availability of other goods that can be substituted for it. When there are close substitutes, a price increase will cause the consumer to buy less of the good and more of the substitute. Demand will then be highly price elastic. When there are no close substitutes, demand will tend to be price inelastic.• elasticity  Percentage

7In terms of infinitesimal changes (letting the /H9004P become very small), Ep=(P/Q)(dQ/dP).34  PART 1   •  Introduction: Markets and Prices
LINEAR DEMAND CURVE  Equation (2.1) says that the price elasticity of 
demand is the change in quantity associated with a change in price ( /H9004Q//H9004P) 
times the ratio of price to quantity ( P/Q). But as we move down the demand 
curve, /H9004Q//H9004Pmay change, and the price and quantity will always change. 
Therefore, the price elasticity of demand must be measured at a particular point on 
the demand curve  and will generally change as we move along the curve.
This principle is easiest to see for a linear demand curve —that is, a demand 
curve of the form
Q=a-bP
As an example, consider the demand curve
Q=8-2P
For this curve, /H9004Q//H9004P is constant and equal to -2 (a /H9004P of 1 results in a /H9004Q 
of -2). However, the curve does not have a constant elasticity. Observe from 
Figure 2.11 that as we move down the curve, the ratio P/Q falls; the elastic-
ity therefore decreases in magnitude. Near the intersection of the curve with the price axis, Q is very small, so E
p=-2(P/Q) is large in magnitude. When 
P=2 and Q=4 , Ep=-1. At the intersection with the quantity axis, P=0 
so EP=0.
Because we draw demand (and supply) curves with price on the vertical axis 
and quantity on the horizontal axis, /H9004Q//H9004P=(1/slope of curve). As a result, 
for any price and quantity combination, the steeper the slope of the curve, the less elastic is demand. Figure 2.12 shows two special cases. Figure 2.12(a) shows a demand curve reflecting infinitely elastic demand:  Consumers will buy as 
much as they can at a single price P*. For even the smallest increase in price 
above this level, quantity demanded drops to zero, and for any decrease in price, quantity demanded increases without limit. The demand curve in Figure 2.12(b), on the other hand, reflects completely inelastic demand:  Consumers will buy a 
fixed quantity Q*, no matter what the price.
OTHER DEMAND ELASTICITIES  We will also be interested in elasticities of 
demand with respect to other variables besides price. For example, demand for most goods usually rises when aggregate income rises. The income elasticity of • linear demand curve

LINEAR DEMAND CURVE
The price elasticity of demand depends not only 
on the slope of the demand curve but also on the price and quantity. The elasticity, therefore, var-ies along the curve as price and quantity change. Slope is constant for this linear demand curve. Near the top, because price is high and quantity is small, the elasticity is large in magnitude. The elas-ticity becomes smaller as we move down the curve.CHAPTER 2   •  The Basics of Supply and Demand  35
• income elasticity of demand   
Percentage change in the quantity demanded resulting from a 1-percent increase in income.demand  is the percentage change in the quantity demanded, Q, resulting from a 
1-percent increase in income I:
 EI= /H9004Q/Q
/H9004I/I = I
Q /H9004Q
/H9004I (2.2)
The demand for some goods is also affected by the prices of other goods. For 
example, because butter and margarine can easily be substituted for each other, the demand for each depends on the price of the other. A cross-price elasticity 
of demand  refers to the percentage change in the quantity demanded for a good 
that results from a 1-percent increase in the price of another good. So the elasticity of demand for butter with respect to the price of margarine would be written as
 E
QbPm= /H9004Qb/Qb
/H9004Pm/Pm = Pm
Qb /H9004Qb
/H9004Pm (2.3)
where Qb is the quantity of butter and Pm is the price of margarine.
In this example, the cross-price elasticities will be positive because the 
goods are substitutes : Because they compete in the market, a rise in the price 
of  margarine, which makes butter cheaper relative to margarine, leads to an increase in the quantity of butter demanded. (Because the demand curve for butter will shift to the right, the price of butter will rise.) But this is not always the case. Some goods are complements : Because they tend to be used together, an 
increase in the price of one tends to push down the consumption of the other. Take gasoline and motor oil. If the price of gasoline goes up, the quantity of • cross-price elasticity of

in demand, the elasticity of demand is infinite. (b) For a vertical demand curve, /H9004Q//H9004P is zero. Because the quantity

gasoline demanded falls—motorists will drive less. And because people are 
driving less, the demand for motor oil also falls. (The entire demand curve for motor oil shifts to the left.) Thus, the cross-price elasticity of motor oil with respect to gasoline is negative.
ELASTICITIES OF SUPPLY  Elasticities of supply are defined in a similar man-
ner. The price elasticity of supply  is the percentage change in the quantity 
 supplied resulting from a 1-percent increase in price. This elasticity is usually positive because a higher price gives producers an incentive to increase output.
We can also refer to elasticities of supply with respect to such variables as 
interest rates, wage rates, and the prices of raw materials and other intermedi-ate goods used to manufacture the product in question. For example, for most manufactured goods, the elasticities of supply with respect to the prices of raw materials are negative. An increase in the price of a raw material input means higher costs for the firm; other things being equal, therefore, the quantity sup-plied will fall.
Point versus Arc Elasticities
So far, we have considered elasticities at a particular point on the demand curve or the supply curve. These are called point elasticities . The point elastic-
ity of demand,  for example, is the price elasticity of demand at a particular point 
on the demand curve  and is defined by Equation (2.1). As we demonstrated in 
Figure 2.11 using a linear demand curve, the point elasticity of demand can vary depending on where it is measured along the demand curve.
There are times, however, when we want to calculate a price elasticity 
over some portion of the demand curve (or supply curve) rather than at a single point. Suppose, for example, that we are contemplating an increase in the price of a product from $8.00 to $10.00 and expect the quantity demanded to fall from 6 units to 4. How should we calculate the price elasticity of demand? Is the price increase 25 percent (a $2 increase divided by the origi-nal price of $8), or is it 20 percent (a $2 increase divided by the new price of $10)? Is the percentage decrease in quantity demanded 33 1/3 percent (2/6) or 50 percent (2/4)?
There is no correct answer to such questions. We could calculate the price 
elasticity using the original price and quantity. If so, we would find that 
E
p=(-33 1/3 percent/25 percent) =-1.33. Or we could use the new price 
and quantity, in which case we would find that Ep=(-50 percent/20 percent)
=-2.5. The difference between these two calculated elastici ties is large, and 
neither seems preferable to the other.
ARC ELASTICITY OF DEMAND  We can resolve this problem by using the arc 
elasticity of demand:  the elasticity calculated over a range of prices . Rather than 
choose either the initial or the final price, we use an average of the two, P; for 
the quantity demanded, we use Q. Thus the arc elasticity of demand is given by
 Arc elasticity: Ep=(/H9004Q//H9004P)(P/Q) (2.4)
In our example, the average price is $9 and the average quantity 5 units. Thus 
the arc elasticity is

EXAMPLE 2.5  THE MARKET FOR WHEAT
Wheat is an important agricultural 
commodity, and the wheat market has been studied extensively by agricultural economists. During recent decades, changes in the wheat market had major implications for both American farmers and U.S. agricultural policy. To under-stand what happened, let’s examine the behavior of supply and demand begin-ning in 1981.
From statistical studies, we know that for 1981 the supply curve for wheat 
was approximately as follows:
8
Supply : QS=1800 +240P
where price is measured in nominal dollars per bushel and quantities in 
millions of bushels per year. These studies also indicate that in 1981, the demand curve for wheat was
Demand : Q
D=3550 -266P
By setting the quantity supplied equal to the quantity demanded, we can 
determine the market-clearing price of wheat for 1981:
 QS=QD
 1800 +240P=3550 -266P
 506P=1750
 P=$3.46  per bushel
To find the market-clearing quantity, substitute this price of $3.46 into either 
the supply curve equation or the demand curve equation. Substituting into the supply curve equation, we get
Q=1800 +(240)(3.46) =2630
 million bushels
8For a survey of statistical studies of the demand and supply of wheat and an analysis of evolving 
market conditions, see Larry Salathe and Sudchada Langley, “An Empirical Analysis of Alternative Export Subsidy Programs for U.S. Wheat,” Agricultural Economics Research  38:1 (Winter 1986). The 
supply and demand curves in this example are based on the studies they surveyed.The arc elasticity will always lie somewhere (but not necessarily halfway) 
between the point elasticities calculated at the lower and the higher prices.
Although the arc elasticity of demand is sometimes useful, economists gener-
ally use the word “elasticity” to refer to a point  elasticity. Throughout the rest of 
this book, we will do the same, unless noted otherwise.38  PART 1   •  Introduction: Markets and Prices
What are the price elasticities of demand and supply at this price and 
quantity? We use the demand curve to find the price elasticity of demand:
EPD= P
Q /H9004QD
/H9004P = 3.46
2630 (-266)=-0.35
Thus demand is inelastic. We can likewise calculate the price elasticity of supply:
EPS= P
Q /H9004QS
/H9004P
=3.46
2630 (240) =0.32
Because these supply and demand curves are linear, the price elasticities 
will vary as we move along the curves. For example, suppose that a drought caused the supply curve to shift far enough to the left to push the price up to $4.00 per bushel. In this case, the quantity demanded would fall to 
3550 -(266)(4.00) =2486 million bushels. At this price and quantity, the 
elasticity of demand would be
E
PD= 4.00
2486 (-266)=-0.43
The wheat market has evolved over the years, in part because of changes 
in demand. The demand for wheat has two components: domestic (demand by U.S. consumers) and export (demand by foreign consumers). During the 1980s and 1990s, domestic demand for wheat rose only slightly (due to modest increases in population and income). Export demand, however, fell sharply. There were several reasons. First and foremost was the success of the Green Revolution in agriculture: Developing countries like India, which had been large importers of wheat, became increasingly self-sufficient. In addition, European countries adopted protectionist policies that subsidized their own production and imposed tariff barriers against imported wheat.
In 2007, demand and supply were
 Demand : Q
D=2900 -125P
 Supply : QS=1460 +115P
Once again, equating quantity supplied and quantity demanded yields the 
market-clearing (nominal) price and quantity:
 1460 +115P=2900 -125P
 P=$6.00  per bushel
 Q=1460 +(115)(6) =2150  million bushelsCHAPTER 2   •  The Basics of Supply and Demand  39
2.5   Short-Run versus Long-Run Elasticities
When analyzing demand and supply, we must distinguish between the short 
run and the long run. In other words, if we ask how much demand or supply changes in response to a change in price, we must be clear about how much time 
is allowed to pass before we measure the changes in the quantity demanded or sup-plied . If we allow only a short time to pass—say, one year or less—then we are 
dealing with the short run . When we refer to the long run  we mean that enough 
time is allowed for consumers or producers to adjust fully  to the price change. 
In general, short-run demand and supply curves look very different from their long-run counterparts.Thus the price of wheat (in nominal terms) rose considerably since 1981. In fact, nearly all of this increase occurred during 2005 to 2007. (In 2002, for example, the price of wheat was only $2.78 per bushel.) The causes? Dry weather in 2005, even dryer weather in 2006, and heavy rains in 2007 com-bined with increased export demand. You can check to see that, at the 2007 price and quantity, the price elasticity of demand was -0.35 and the price 
elasticity of supply 0.32. Given these low elasticities, it is not surprising that the price of wheat rose so sharply.
9
International demand for U. S. wheat fluctuates with the weather and 
political conditions in other major wheat producing countries, such as China, India and Russia. Between 2008 and 2010, U.S. wheat exports fell by 30% in the face of robust international production, so the price of wheat reached a low of $4.87 in 2010, down from $6.48 two years earlier. Inclement weather led to shortfalls in 2011, however, and U.S. exports shot up by 33%, driving the price up to $5.70 in 2011.
We found that the market-clearing price of wheat was $3.46 in 1981, but 
in fact the price was greater than this. Why? Because the U.S.  government 
bought wheat through its price support program. In addition, farmers have been receiving direct subsidies for the wheat they produce. This aid to farmers (at the expense of taxpayers) has increased in magnitude. In 2002—and again in 2008—Congress passed legislation continuing (and in some cases expanding) subsidies to farmers. The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 authorized farm aid through 2012, at a projected cost of $284 billion over five years. Recent U.S. budget crises, how-ever, have given support to those in Congress who feel these subsidies  
should end.
10
Agricultural policies that support farmers exist in the United States, 
Europe, Japan, and many other countries. We discuss how these policies work, and evaluate the costs and benefits for consumers, farmers, and the government budget in Chapter 9.

Demand
For many goods, demand is much more price elastic in the long run than in 
the short run. For one thing, it takes time for people to change their consump-tion habits. For example, even if the price of coffee rises sharply, the quantity demanded will fall only gradually as consumers begin to drink less. In addi-tion, the demand for a good might be linked to the stock of another good that changes only slowly. For example, the demand for gasoline is much more elastic in the long run than in the short run. A sharply higher price of gaso-line reduces the quantity demanded in the short run by causing motorists to drive less, but it has its greatest impact on demand by inducing consum-ers to buy smaller and more fuel-efficient cars. But because the stock of cars changes only slowly, the quantity of gasoline demanded falls only slowly. Figure 2.13(a) shows short-run and long-run demand curves for goods such as these.
DEMAND AND DURABILITY  On the other hand, for some goods just the 
opposite is true—demand is more elastic in the short run than in the long run. Because these goods (automobiles, refrigerators, televisions, or the capital equip-ment purchased by industry) are durable , the total stock of each good owned by

(a) GASOLINE: SHORT-RUN AND LONG-RUN DEMAND CURVES 
(b) AUTOMOBILES: SHORT-RUN AND LONG-RUN DEMAND CURVES
(a) In the short run, an increase in price has only a small effect on the quantity of gasoline demanded. 
Motorists may drive less, but they will not change the kinds of cars they are driving overnight. In the  longer run, however, because they will shift to smaller and more fuel-efficient cars, the effect of the 
price increase will be larger. Demand, therefore, is more elastic in the long run than in the short run. (b) The opposite is true for automobile demand. If price increases, consumers initially defer buying new 
cars; thus annual quantity demanded falls sharply. In the longer run, however, old cars wear out and must be replaced; thus annual quantity demanded picks up. Demand, therefore, is less elastic in the long run than in the short run.CHAPTER 2   •  The Basics of Supply and Demand  41
 consumers is large relative to annual production. As a result, a small change 
in the total stock that consumers want to hold can result in a large percentage change in the level of purchases.
Suppose, for example, that the price of refrigerators goes up 10 percent, caus-
ing the total stock of refrigerators that consumers want to hold to drop 5 percent. Initially, this will cause purchases of new refrigerators to drop much more than 5 percent. But eventually, as consumers’ refrigerators depreciate (and units must be replaced), the quantity demanded will increase again. In the long run, the total stock of refrigerators owned by consumers will be about 5 percent less than before the price increase. In this case, while the long-run price elasticity of demand for refrigerators would be -.05/.10 =-0.5, the short-run elasticity would be much 
larger in magnitude.
Or consider automobiles. Although annual U.S. demand—new car pur-
chases—is about 10 to 12 million, the stock of cars that people own is around 130 million. If automobile prices rise, many people will delay buying new cars. The quantity demanded will fall sharply, even though the total stock of cars that consumers might want to own at these higher prices falls only a small amount. Eventually, however, because old cars wear out and must be replaced, the quantity of new cars demanded picks up again. As a result, the long-run change in the quantity demanded is much smaller than the short-run change. Figure 2.13(b) shows demand curves for a durable good like automobiles.
INCOME ELASTICITIES  Income elasticities also differ from the short run to 
the long run. For most goods and services—foods, beverages, fuel, entertain-ment, etc.—the income elasticity of demand is larger in the long run than in the short run. Consider the behavior of gasoline consumption during a period of strong economic growth during which aggregate income rises by 10 percent. Eventually people will increase gasoline consumption because they can afford to take more trips and perhaps own larger cars. But this change in consumption takes time, and demand initially increases only by a small amount. Thus, the long-run elasticity will be larger than the short-run elasticity.
For a durable good, the opposite is true. Again, consider automobiles. If 
aggregate income rises by 10 percent, the total stock of cars that consumers will want to own will also rise—say, by 5 percent. But this change means a much larger increase in current purchases  of cars. (If the stock is 130 million, a 5-percent 
increase is 6.5 million, which might be about 60 to 70 percent of normal demand in a single year.) Eventually consumers succeed in increasing the total number of cars owned; after the stock has been rebuilt, new purchases are made largely to replace old cars. (These new purchases will still be greater than before because a larger stock of cars outstanding means that more cars need to be replaced each year.) Clearly, the short-run income elasticity of demand will be much larger than the long-run elasticity.
CYCLICAL INDUSTRIES  Because the demands for durable goods fluctuate 
so sharply in response to short-run changes in income, the industries that produce these goods are quite vulnerable to changing macroeconomic condi-tions, and in particular to the business cycle—recessions and booms. Thus, these industries are often called cyclical industries —their sales patterns tend

to magnify cyclical changes in gross domestic product (GDP) and national 
income.
Figures 2.14 and 2.15 illustrate this principle. Figure 2.14 plots two variables 
over time: the annual real (inflation-adjusted) rate of growth of GDP and the annual real rate of growth of investment in producers’ durable equipment (i.e., machinery and other equipment purchased by firms). Note that although the durable equipment series follows the same pattern as the GDP series, the changes in GDP are magnified. For example, in 1961–1966 GDP grew by at least 4 percent each year. Purchases of durable equipment also grew, but by much more (over 10 percent in 1963–1966). Equipment investment likewise grew much more quickly than GDP during 1993–1998. On the other hand, during the recessions of 1974–1975, 1982, 1991, 2001, and 2008, equipment purchases fell by much more than GDP .
Figure 2.15 also shows the real rate of growth of GDP , along with the 
annual real rates of growth of spending by consumers on durable goods (automobiles, appliances, etc.) and nondurable goods (food, fuel, clothing, etc.). Note that while both consumption series follow GDP , only the durable goods series tends to magnify changes in GDP . Changes in consumption of nondurables are roughly the same as changes in GDP , but changes in con-sumption of durables are usually several times larger. This is why companies CHAPTER 2   •  The Basics of Supply and Demand  43
EXAMPLE 2.6  THE DEMAND FOR GASOLINE 
AND AUTOMOBILES
Gasoline and automobiles exemplify some of the different characteristics of 
demand discussed above. They are complementary goods—an increase in the price of one tends to reduce the demand for the other. In addition, their respective dynamic behaviors (long-run versus short-run elasticities) are just the opposite from each other. For gasoline, the long-run price and income elastici-ties are larger than the short-run elasticities; for automobiles, the reverse is true.GDPDurables

CONSUMPTION OF DURABLES VERSUS NONDURABLES
Annual growth rates are compared for GDP , consumer expenditures on durable goods (automobiles, appliances,  
 furniture, etc.), and consumer expenditures on nondurable goods (food, clothing, services, etc.). Because the 
stock of durables is large compared with annual demand, short-run demand elasticities are larger than long-run elasticities. Like capital  equipment, industries that produce consumer durables are “cyclical” (i.e., changes in 
GDP are magnified). This is not true for producers of nondurables.

11 Table 2.1 shows price 
and income elasticities of demand for gasoline in the United States for the short run, the long run, and just about everything in between.
Note the large differences between the long-run and the short-run 
 elasticities. Following the sharp increases that occurred in the price of gaso-
line with the rise of the OPEC oil cartel in 1974, many people (including executives in the automobile and oil industries) claimed that the quantity of gasoline demanded would not change much—that demand was not very elastic. Indeed, for the first year after the price rise, they were right. But demand did eventually change. It just took time for people to alter their driving habits and to replace large cars with smaller and more fuel-efficient ones. This response continued after the second sharp increase in oil prices that occurred in 1979–1980. It was partly because of this response that OPEC could not maintain oil prices above $30 per barrel, and prices fell. The oil and gasoline price increases that occurred in 2005–2011 likewise led to a gradual demand response.
Table 2.2 shows price and income elasticities of demand for automo-
biles. Note that the short-run elasticities are much larger than the long-run

 elasticities. It should be clear from the income elasticities why the automobile 
industry is so highly cyclical. For example, GDP fell 2 percent in real (inflation-adjusted) terms during the 1991 recession, but automobile sales fell by about 8 percent. Auto sales began to recover in 1993, and rose sharply between 1995 and 1999. During the 2008 recession, GDP fell by nearly 3 percent, and car and truck sales decreased by 21%. Sales began to recover in 2010, when they increased by nearly 10%.
Supply
Elasticities of supply also differ from the long run to the short run. For most products, long-run supply is much more price elastic than short-run supply: Firms face capacity constraints  in the short run and need time to expand capacity 
by building new production facilities and hiring workers to staff them. This is not to say that the quantity supplied will not increase in the short run if price goes up sharply. Even in the short run, firms can increase output by using their existing facilities for more hours per week, paying workers to work overtime, and hiring some new workers immediately. But firms will be able to expand output much more when they have the time to expand their facilities and hire larger permanent workforces.
For some goods and services, short-run supply is completely inelastic. Rental 
housing in most cities is an example. In the very short run, there is only a fixed number of rental units. Thus an increase in demand only pushes rents up. In the longer run, and without rent controls, higher rents provide an incentive to renovate existing buildings and construct new ones. As a result, the quantity supplied increases.
For most goods, however, firms can find ways to increase output even in the 
short run—if the price incentive is strong enough. However, because various constraints make it costly to increase output rapidly, it may require large price increases to elicit small short-run increases in the quantity supplied. We discuss these characteristics of supply in more detail in Chapter 8.
SUPPLY AND DURABILITY  For some goods, supply is more elastic in the short 
run than in the long run. Such goods are durable and can be recycled as part of supply if price goes up. An example is the secondary supply  of  metals: the supply 
from scrap metal , which is often melted down and refabricated. When the price 
of copper goes up, it increases the incentive to convert scrap copper into new supply, so that, initially, secondary supply increases sharply. Eventually, how-ever, the stock of good-quality scrap falls, making the  melting, purifying, and refabricating more costly. Secondary supply then  contracts. Thus the long-run price elasticity of secondary supply is smaller than the short-run elasticity.
Figures 2.16(a) and 2.16(b) show short-run and long-run supply curves for 
 primary (production from the mining and smelting of ore) and secondary  copper production. Table 2.3 shows estimates of the elasticities for each  component of  supply and for total supply, based on a weighted average of the component elasticities.
12 Because secondary supply is only about 20 percent of total supply, 
the price elasticity of total supply is larger in the long run than in the short run.
12These estimates were obtained by aggregating the regional estimates reported in Franklin M. Fisher, 
Paul H. Cootner, and Martin N. Baily, “An Econometric Model of the World Copper Industry,” Bell 
Journal of Economics  3 (Autumn 1972): 568–609.46  PART 1   •  Introduction: Markets and Prices

COPPER: SHORT-RUN AND LONG-RUN SUPPLY CURVES
Like that of most goods, the supply of primary copper, shown in part ( a), is more elastic in the long run. 
If price increases, firms would like to produce more but are limited by capacity constraints in the short run. In the longer run, they can add to capacity and produce more. Part ( b) shows supply curves for secondary 
 copper. If the price increases, there is a greater incentive to convert scrap copper into new supply. Initially, 
therefore,  secondary supply (i.e., supply from scrap) increases sharply. But later, as the stock of scrap falls, 
 secondary  supply contracts. Secondary supply is therefore less elastic in the long run than in the short run.
EXAMPLE 2.7  THE WEATHER IN BRAZIL AND THE PRICE OF COFFEE 
IN NEW YORK
Droughts or subfreezing weather 
occasionally destroy or dam-age many of Brazil’s coffee trees. Because Brazil is by far the world’s largest coffee producer the result is a decrease in the supply of coffee and a sharp run-up in its price.
In July 1975, for example, a 
frost destroyed most of Brazil’s 1976–1977 coffee crop. (Remember that it is  winter in Brazil when it is summer in 
the northern hemisphere.) As Figure 2.17 shows, the price of a pound of coffee in New York went from 68 cents in 1975 to $1.23 in 1976 and $2.70 in 1977. Prices fell but then jumped again in 1986, after a seven-month drought in 1985 ruined much of 
Brazil’s crop. Finally, starting in June 1994, freezing

weather  followed by a drought destroyed nearly 
half of Brazil’s crop. As a result, the price of coffee in 1994–1995 was about double its 1993 level. By 2002, however, the price had dropped to its low-est level in 30 years. (Researchers predict that over the next 50 years, global warming may eliminate as much as 60 percent of Brazil’s coffee-growing areas, resulting in a major decline in coffee production and an increase in prices. Should that happen, we will discuss it in the twentieth edition of this book.)
The important point in Figure 2.17 is that any 
run-up in price following a freeze or drought is usu-ally short-lived. Within a year, price begins to fall; within three or four years, it returns to its earlier levels. In 1978, for example, the price of coffee in New York fell to $1.48 per pound, and by 1983, it had fallen in real (inflation-adjusted) terms to within a few cents of its prefreeze 1975 price.
13 Likewise, in 
1987 the price of coffee fell to below its predrought 1984 level, and then continued declining until the 
1994 freeze. After hitting a low of 45 cents per pound in 2002, coffee prices increased at an aver-age rate of 17% per year, reaching $1.46—equal to the 1995 peak—in 2010. Brazilian coffee growers have worked to increase their production in the past decade, but bad weather has led to inconsistent crop yields.
Coffee prices behave this way because both 
demand and supply (especially supply) are much more elastic in the long run than in the short run. Figure 2.18 illustrates this fact. Note from part (a) of the figure that in the very short run (within one or two months after a freeze), supply is completely inelastic: There are simply a fixed number of coffee beans, some of which have been damaged by the frost. Demand is also relatively inelastic. As a result of the frost, the supply curve shifts to the left, and price increases sharply, from P
0 to P1.
13During 1980, however, prices temporarily went just above $2.00 per pound as a result of export 
quotas imposed under the International Coffee Agreement (ICA). The ICA is essentially a cartel agreement implemented by the coffee-producing countries in 1968. It has been largely ineffective and has seldom had an effect on the price. We discuss cartel pricing in detail in Chapter 12.48  PART 1   •  Introduction: Markets and Prices

SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR COFFEE
(a) A freeze or drought in Brazil causes the supply curve to shift to the left. In the short run, supply is completely inelastic; 
only a fixed number of coffee beans can be harvested. Demand is also relatively inelastic; consumers change their hab-its only slowly. As a result, the initial effect of the freeze is a sharp increase in price, from P
0 to P1. (b) In the intermediate 
run, supply and demand are both more elastic; thus price falls part of the way back, to P2. (c) In the long run, supply is 
 extremely elastic; because new coffee trees will have had time to mature, the effect of the freeze will have disappeared. 
Price returns to P0.
In the intermediate run—say, one year after the 
freeze—both supply and demand are more elas-tic, supply because existing trees can be harvested more intensively (with some decrease in quality), and demand because consumers have had time to change their buying habits. As part (b) shows, although the intermediate-run supply curve also shifts to the left, price has come down from P
1 to P2. The quantity supplied has also increased somewhat 
from the short run, from Q1 to Q2. In the long run 
shown in part (c), price returns to its normal level because growers have had time to replace trees damaged by the freeze. The long-run supply curve, then, simply reflects the cost of producing coffee, including the costs of land, of planting and caring for the trees, and of a competitive rate of profit.

* 2.6   Understanding and Predicting the 
Effects of Changing Market Conditions
So far, our discussion of supply and demand has been largely qualitative. To 
use supply and demand curves to analyze and predict the effects of changing market conditions, we must begin attaching numbers to them. For example, to see how a 50-percent reduction in the supply of Brazilian coffee may affect the world price of coffee, we must determine actual supply and demand

curves and then calculate the shifts in those curves and the resulting changes 
in price.
In this section, we will see how to do simple “back of the envelope” calcula-
tions with linear supply and demand curves. Although they are often approxi-mations of more complex curves, we use linear curves because they are easier to work with. It may come as a surprise, but one can do some informative  economic analyses on the back of a small envelope with a pencil and a pocket calculator.
First, we must learn how to “fit” linear demand and supply curves to market 
data. (By this we do not mean statistical fitting  in the sense of linear regression 
or other statistical techniques, which we will discuss later in the book.) Suppose we have two sets of numbers for a particular market: The first set consists of the price and quantity that generally prevail in the market (i.e., the price and quantity that prevail “on average,” when the market is in equilibrium or when market conditions are “normal”). We call these numbers the equilibrium price  
and quantity  and denote them by P* and Q*. The second set consists of the price 
elasticities of supply and demand for the market (at or near the equilibrium), which we denote by E
S and ED, as before.
These numbers may come from a statistical study done by someone else; they 
may be numbers that we simply think are reasonable; or they may be numbers that we want to try out on a “what if” basis. Our goal is to write down the sup-
ply and demand curves that fit (i.e., are consistent with) these numbers . We can then 
determine numerically how a change in a variable such as GDP , the price of another good, or some cost of production will cause supply or demand to shift and thereby affect market price and quantity.
Let’s begin with the linear curves shown in Figure 2.19. We can write these 
curves algebraically as follows:
 Demand :  
 Q=a-bP (2.5a)
 Supply :  Q=c+dP (2.5b)
Q*P* Price
Quantity a–c/da/b
Demand: Q = a – bPSupply: Q  = c + dP
ED = –b(P*/Q*)
ES = d(P*/Q*)FIGURE 2.19
FITTING LINEAR SUPPLY 
AND DEMAND CURVES  TO DATA
Linear supply and demand curves 
provide a convenient tool for analysis. Given data for the equi-librium price and quantity P* and 
Q*, as well as estimates of the 
elasticities of demand and sup-ply E
D and ES, we can calculate 
the parameters c and d for the 
supply curve and a and b for the 
demand curve. (In the case drawn here, c < 0.) The curves can then 
be used to analyze the behavior of the market quantitatively.50  PART 1   •  Introduction: Markets and Prices
Our problem is to choose numbers for the constants a, b, c, and d. This is done, 
for supply and for demand, in a two-step procedure:
/L50539 Step 1:  Recall that each price elasticity, whether of supply or demand, can be 
written as
E=(P/Q)(/H9004Q//H9004P)
 where /H9004Q//H9004P is the change in quantity demanded or supplied resulting from 
a small change in price. For linear curves, /H9004Q//H9004P is constant. From equations 
(2.5a) and (2.5b), we see that /H9004Q//H9004P=d for supply and /H9004Q//H9004P=-b for 
 demand. Now, let’s substitute these values for /H9004Q//H9004P into the elasticity formula:
 Demand :  ED=-b(P*/Q*) (2.6a)
 Supply :  ES=d(P*/Q*)  (2.6b)
 where P* and Q* are the equilibrium price and quantity for which we have 
data and to which we want to fit the curves. Because we have numbers for ES, 
ED, P*, and Q*, we can substitute these numbers in equations (2.6a) and (2.6b) 
and solve for b and d.
/L50539 Step 2:  Since we now know b and d, we can substitute these numbers, as 
well as P* and Q*, into equations (2.5a) and (2.5b) and solve for the remaining 
constants a and c. For example, we can rewrite equation (2.5a) as
a=Q*+bP*
 and then use our data for Q* and P*, together with the number we calculated 
in Step 1 for b, to obtain a.
Let’s apply this procedure to a specific example: long–run supply and demand 
for the world copper market. The relevant numbers for this market are as follows:
Quantity Q*=18 million metric tons per year (mmt/yr)
Price P*=$3.00  per pound
Elasticity of suppy E S=1.5
Elasticity of demand E D=-0.5.
(The price of copper has fluctuated during the past few decades between $0.60 
and more than $4.00, but $3.00 is a reasonable average price for 2008–2011).
We begin with the supply curve equation (2.5b) and use our two-step proce-
dure to calculate numbers for c and d. The long-run price elasticity of supply is 
1.5, P* = $3.00, and Q* = 18.
/L50539 Step 1:  Substitute these numbers in equation (2.6b) to determine d:
1.5=d(3/18) =d/6
 so that d=(1.5)(6) =9.
/L50539 Step 2:  Substitute this number for d, together with the numbers for P* and 
Q*, into equation (2.5b) to determine c:
18=c+(9)(3.00) =c+27CHAPTER 2   •  The Basics of Supply and Demand  51
 so that c=18-27=-9. We now know c and d, so we can write our supply 
curve:
Supply :  Q=-9+9P
We can now follow the same steps for the demand curve equation (2.5a). 
An estimate for the long-run elasticity of demand is −0.5.15 First, substitute 
this number, as well as the values for P* and Q*, into equation (2.6a) to 
determine b:
-0.5=-b(3/18) =-b/6
so that b=(0.5)(6) =3. Second, substitute this value for b and the values for P* 
and Q* in equation (2.5a) to determine a:
18=a=(3)(3) =a-9
so that a=18+9=27. Thus, our demand curve is:
Demand :  Q=27-3P
To check that we have not made a mistake, let’s set the quantity supplied 
equal to the quantity demanded and calculate the resulting equilibrium price:
Supply =-9+9P=27-3P=Demand
9P+3P=27+9
or P=36/12 =3.00, which is indeed the equilibrium price with which we began.
Although we have written supply and demand so that they depend only 
on price, they could easily depend on other variables as well. Demand, for example, might depend on income as well as price. We would then write demand as
 Q=a-bP+fI (2.7)
where I is an index of the aggregate income or GDP . For example, I might equal 
1.0 in a base year and then rise or fall to reflect percentage increases or decreases in aggregate income.
For our copper market example, a reasonable estimate for the long-run 
income elasticity of demand is 1.3. For the linear demand curve (2.7), we can then calculate f by using the formula for the income elasticity of demand: 
E=(I/Q)(/H9004Q//H9004I). Taking the base value of I as 1.0, we have
1.3=(1.0/18)( f).
Thus f=(1.3)(18)/(1.0) =23.4. Finally, substituting the values b=3, 
f=23.4, P*=3.00, and Q*=18 into equation (2.7), we can calculate that a 
must equal 3.6.
15See Claudio Agostini, “Estimating Market Power in the U.S. Copper Industry,” Review of Industrial 
Organization  28 (2006), 17 /H1100239.52  PART 1   •  Introduction: Markets and Prices
We have seen how to fit linear supply and demand curves to data. Now, to 
see how these curves can be used to analyze markets, let’s look at Example 2.8, which deals with the behavior of copper prices, and Example 2.9, which  concerns the world oil market.
EXAMPLE 2.8  THE BEHAVIOR OF COPPER PRICES
After reaching a level of about $1.00 per pound in 1980, the price of copper fell sharply to about 60 cents per pound in 1986. In real (inflation-adjusted) terms, this price was even lower than during the Great Depression 50 years earlier. Prices increased in 1988–1989 and in 1995, largely as a result of strikes by miners in Peru and Canada that disrupted  supplies, but then fell again from 1996 through 2003. 
Prices increased sharply, however, between 2003 and 2007, and while copper fell along with many other commodities during the 2008–2009 recession, the price of copper had recovered by early 2010. 
Figure 2.20 shows the behavior of copper prices from 1965 to 2011 in both real and nominal terms.
Worldwide recessions in 1980 and 1982 contrib-
uted to the decline of copper prices; as mentioned above, the income elasticity of copper demand is about 1.3. But copper demand did not pick up as the industrial economies recovered during the mid-1980s. Instead, the 1980s saw a steep decline in demand.
The price decline through 2003 occurred for two 
reasons. First, a large part of copper consumption is

COPPER PRICES, 1965–2011
Copper prices are shown in both nominal (no adjustment for inflation) and real (inflation-adjusted) 
terms. In real terms, copper prices declined steeply from the early 1970s through the mid-1980s as demand fell. In 1988–1990, copper prices rose in response to supply disruptions caused by strikes in Peru and Canada but later fell after the strikes ended. Prices declined during the 1996–2002 period but then increased sharply starting in 2005.CHAPTER 2   •  The Basics of Supply and Demand  53
16Our thanks to Patricia Foley, Executive Director of the American Bureau of Metal Statistics, for sup-
plying the data on China. Other data are from the Monthly Reports of the U.S. Geological Survey Mineral Resources Program— http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/copper .for the construction of equipment for electric power 
generation and transmission. But by the late 1970s, the growth rate of electric power generation had fallen dramatically in most industrialized countries. In the United States, for example, the growth rate fell from over 6 percent per annum in the 1960s and early 1970s to less than 2 percent in the late 1970s and 1980s. This decline meant a big drop in what had been a major source of copper demand. Second, in the 1980s, other materials, such as alu-minum and fiber optics, were increasingly substi-tuted for copper.
Why did the price increase so sharply after 2003? 
First, the demand for copper from China and other Asian countries began increasing dramatically, replacing the demand from Europe and the U.S. Chinese copper consumption, for example, has 
nearly tripled since 2001. Second, because prices had dropped so much from 1996 through 2003, producers in the U.S., Canada, and Chile closed unprofitable mines and cut production. Between 2000 and 2003, for example, U.S. mine production of copper declined by 23 percent.
16
One might expect increasing prices to stimulate 
investments in new mines and increases in pro-duction, and that is indeed what has happened. Arizona, for example, experienced a  copper boom 
as Phelps Dodge opened a major new mine in 2007.
17 By 2007, producers began to worry that 
prices would decline again, either as a result of these new investments or because demand from Asia would level off or even drop.

COPPER SUPPLY AND DEMAND
The shift in the demand curve corresponding to a 20-percent decline in demand leads to a 
10.7-percent decline in price.
17The boom created hundreds of new jobs, which in turn led to increases in housing prices: “Copper 
Boom Creates Housing Crunch,” The Arizona Republic , July 12, 2007.54  PART 1   •  Introduction: Markets and Prices
What would a decline in demand do to the price 
of copper? To find out, we can use the linear supply and demand curves that we just derived. Let’s cal-culate the effect on price of a 20-percent decline in demand. Because we are not concerned here with the effects of GDP growth, we can leave the income term, fI, out of the demand equation.
We want to shift the demand curve to the left by 
20 percent. In other words, we want the quantity demanded to be 80 percent of what it would be oth-erwise for every value of price. For our linear demand curve, we simply multiply the right–hand side by 0.8:Q=(0.8)(27 -3P
 )=21.6 -2.4P
Supply is again Q=-9+9P. Now we can equate 
the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded and solve for price:
-9+9P=21.6 -2.4P
or P=30.6/11.4 =$2.68 per pound. A decline 
in demand of 20 percent, therefore, entails a drop in price of roughly 32 cents per pound, or 10.7 percent.
18
18Note that because we have multiplied the demand function by 0.8—i.e., reduced the quantity 
demanded at every price by 20 percent—the new demand curve is not parallel to the old one. Instead, the curve rotates downward at its intersection with the price axis.EXAMPLE 2.9  UPHEAVAL IN THE WORLD OIL MARKET
Since the early 1970s, the world oil mar-
ket has been buffeted by the OPEC car-tel and by political turmoil in the Persian Gulf. In 1974, by collectively restrain-ing output, OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) pushed world oil prices well above what they would have been in a competitive market. OPEC could do this because it accounted for much of world oil production. During 
1979–1980, oil prices shot up again, as the Iranian revolution and the out-break of the Iran-Iraq war sharply reduced Iranian and Iraqi production. During the 1980s, the price gradually declined, as demand fell and competitive (i.e., non-OPEC) supply rose in response to price. Prices remained relatively stable during 1988–2001, except for a temporary spike in 1990 following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Prices increased again in 2002–2003 as a result of a strike in Venezuela and then the war with Iraq that began in the spring of 2003. Oil prices continued to increase through the summer of 2008 as a result of ris-ing demand in Asia and reductions in OPEC output. By the end of 2008, the recession had reduced demand around the world, leading prices to plummet 127% in six months. Between 2009 and 2011, oil prices have gradually recov-ered, partially buoyed by China’s continuing growth. Figure 2.22 shows the world price of oil from 1970 to 2011, in both nominal and real terms.
19
The Persian Gulf is one of the less stable regions of the world—a fact 
that has led to concern over the possibility of new oil supply disruptions and sharp increases in oil prices. What would happen to oil prices—in both the

short run and longer run—if a war or revolution in the Persian Gulf caused a 
sharp cutback in oil production? Let’s see how simple supply and demand curves can be used to predict the outcome of such an event.
Because this example is set in 2009–2011, all prices are measured in 2011 
dollars. Here are some rough figures:
• 2009–2011 world price =$80 per barrel
• World demand and total supply =32 billion barrels per year (bb/yr)
• OPEC supply =13 bb/yr
• Competitive (non-OPEC) supply =19 bb/yr

demand:

PRICE OF CRUDE OIL
The OPEC cartel and political events caused the price of oil to rise sharply at times. It later 
fell as supply and demand adjusted.
20For the sources of these numbers and a more detailed discussion of OPEC oil pricing, see Robert 
S. Pindyck, “Gains to Producers from the Cartelization of Exhaustible Resources,” Review of Economics 
and Statistics  60 (May 1978): 238–51; James M. Griffin and David J. Teece, OPEC  Behavior and World Oil 
Prices  (London: Allen and Unwin, 1982); and John C. B. Cooper, “Price Elasticity of Demand for Crude 
Oil: Estimates for 23 Countries,” Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Review  (March 2003).56  PART 1   •  Introduction: Markets and Prices
You should verify that these numbers imply the following for demand and 
competitive supply in the short run :
Short-run demand:    D=33.6 -.020P
Short-run competitive  demand:  SC=18.05 +0.012 P
Of course, total supply is competitive supply plus OPEC supply, which we 
take as constant at 13 bb/yr. Adding this 13 bb/yr to the competitive supply curve above, we obtain the following for the total short-run  supply:
Short @run total supply:   S
T=31.05 +0.012 P
You should verify that the quantity demanded and the total quantity supplied 
are equal at an equilibrium price of $80 per barrel.
You should also verify that the corresponding demand and supply curves 
for the long run  are as follows:
Long @run demand :  D     =41.6 -0.120 P
 Long-run competitive supply:   SC=13.3 +0.071 P
Long @run total supply :  ST       =26.3 +0.071 P
Again, you can check that the quantities supplied and demanded equate at 
a price of $80.
Saudi Arabia is one of the world’s largest oil producers, accounting for 
roughly 3 bb/yr, which is nearly 10 percent of total world production. What would happen to the price of oil if, because of war or political upheaval, Saudi Arabia stopped producing oil? We can use our supply and demand curves to find out.
For the short run , simply subtract 3 from short-run total supply:
   Short @run demand :
 D=33.6 -.020P
Short @run total demand : ST=28.05 +0.012 P
By equating this total quantity supplied with the quantity demanded, 
we can see that in the short run, the price will more than double to $173.44 per barrel. Figure 2.23 shows this supply shift and the resulting short-run increase in price. The initial equilibrium is at the intersection of S
T and D. 
After the drop in Saudi production, the equilibrium occurs where S'T and 
D cross.
In the long run , however, things will be different. Because both demand and 
competitive supply are more elastic in the long run, the 3 bb/yr cut in oil pro-duction will no longer support such a high price. Subtracting 3 from long-run total supply and equating with long-run demand, we can see that the price will fall to $95.81, only $15.81 above the initial $80 price.
Thus, if Saudi Arabia suddenly stops producing oil, we should expect 
to see about a doubling in price. However, we should also expect to see the price gradually decline afterward, as demand falls and competitive supply rises.CHAPTER 2   •  The Basics of Supply and Demand  57

will shift to the left by 3 bb/yr. In the short-run, price will increase sharply. Part (b) shows long-run 
curves. In the long run, because demand and competitive supply are much more elastic, the impact on price will be much smaller.58  PART 1   •  Introduction: Markets and Prices
This is indeed what happened following the sharp decline in Iranian and 
Iraqi production in 1979–1980. History may or may not repeat itself, but if it does, we can at least predict the impact on oil prices.

EFFECTS OF PRICE  CONTROLS
Without price controls, the market clears at the 
equilibrium price and quantity P0 and Q0. If price 
is regulated to be no higher than Pmax, the quan-
tity supplied falls to Q1, the quantity demanded 
increases to Q2, and a shortage develops.

Intervention—Price Controls
In the United States and most other industrial countries, markets are rarely free 
of government intervention. Besides imposing taxes and granting subsidies, governments often regulate markets (even competitive markets) in a variety of ways. In this section, we will see how to use supply and demand curves to ana-lyze the effects of one common form of government intervention: price controls. Later, in Chapter 9, we will examine the effects of price controls and other forms of government intervention and regulation in more detail.
Figure 2.24 illustrates the effects of price controls. Here, P
0 and Q0 are 
the equilibrium price and quantity that would prevail without government regulation. The government, however, has decided that P
0 is too high and 
mandated that the price can be no higher than a maximum allowable ceil-
ing price , denoted by Pmax. What is the result? At this lower price, producers 
(particularly those with higher costs) will produce less, and the quantity supplied will drop to Q
1. Consumers, on the other hand, will demand more 
at this low price; they would like to purchase the quantity Q2. Demand there-
fore exceeds supply, and a shortage develops—i.e., there is excess demand . 
The amount of excess demand is Q2-Q1.CHAPTER 2   •  The Basics of Supply and Demand  59
This excess demand sometimes takes the form of queues, as when drivers lined 
up to buy gasoline during the winter of 1974 and the summer of 1979. In both instances, the lines were the result of price controls; the government prevented domestic oil and gasoline prices from rising along with world oil prices. Sometimes excess demand results in curtailments and supply rationing, as with natural gas price controls and the resulting gas shortages of the mid-1970s, when industrial consumers closed factories because gas supplies were cut off. Sometimes it spills over into other markets, where it artificially increases demand. For example, natu-ral gas price controls caused potential buyers of gas to use oil instead.
Some people gain and some lose from price controls. As Figure 2.24 suggests, 
producers lose: They receive lower prices, and some leave the industry. Some but not all consumers gain. While those who can purchase the good at a lower price are better off, those who have been “rationed out” and cannot buy the good at all are worse off. How large are the gains to the winners and how large are the losses to the losers? Do total gains exceed total losses? To answer these ques-tions, we need a method to measure the gains and losses from price controls and other forms of government intervention. We discuss such a method in Chapter 9.
EXAMPLE 2.10  PRICE CONTROLS AND NATURAL GAS SHORTAGES
In 1954, the federal government began regulat-ing the wellhead price of natural gas. Initially the controls were not binding; the ceiling prices were above those that cleared the market. But in about 1962, when these ceiling prices did become binding, excess demand for natural gas developed and slowly began to grow. In the 1970s, this excess demand, spurred by higher oil prices, became severe and led to wide-spread curtailments. Soon ceiling prices were far below prices that would have prevailed in a free  
market.
22
Today, producers and industrial consumers of 
natural gas, oil, and other commodities are con-cerned that the government might respond, once again, with price controls if prices rise sharply. Let’s calculate the likely impact of price controls on natu-ral gas, based on market conditions in 2007.
Figure 2.25 shows the wholesale price of natural 
gas, in both nominal and real (2000 dollars) terms, from 1950 through 2007. The following numbers describe the U.S. market in 2007:• The (free-market) wholesale price of natural 
gas was $6.40 per mcf (thousand cubic feet);
• Production and consumption of gas were 23 
Tcf (trillion cubic feet);
• The average price of crude oil (which affects 
the supply and demand for natural gas) was about $50 per barrel.
A reasonable estimate for the price elastic-
ity of supply is 0.2. Higher oil prices also lead to more natural gas production because oil and gas are often discovered and produced together; an estimate of the cross-price elasticity of supply is 0.1. As for demand, the price elasticity is about  
-0.5, and the cross-price elasticity with respect to 
oil price is about 1.5. You can verify that the fol-lowing linear supply and demand curves fit these numbers:
Supply : 
 Q=15.90 +0.72P G+0.05P O
Demand :  Q=0.02 -1.8P G+0.69P O
22This regulation began with the Supreme Court’s 1954 decision requiring the then Federal Power 
Commission to regulate wellhead prices on natural gas sold to interstate pipeline companies. These price controls were largely removed during the 1980s, under the mandate of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. For a detailed discussion of natural gas regulation and its effects, see Paul W. MacAvoy and Robert S. Pindyck, The Economics of the Natural Gas Shortage  (Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1975); R. S. Pindyck, 
“Higher Energy Prices and the Supply of Natural Gas,” Energy Systems and Policy  2(1978): 177–209; and 
Arlon R. Tussing and Connie C. Barlow, The Natural Gas Industry  (Cambridge, MA: Ballinger, 1984).60  PART 1   •  Introduction: Markets and Prices
where Q is the quantity of natural gas (in Tcf), PG 
is the price of natural gas (in dollars per mcf), and P
O is the price of oil (in dollars per barrel). You can 
also verify, by equating the quantities supplied and demanded and substituting $50 for P
O, that these 
supply and demand curves imply an equilibrium free-market price of $6.40 for  natural gas.
Suppose the government determines that the 
free-market price of $6.40 per mcf is too high, decides to impose price controls, and sets a maxi-mum price of $3.00 per mcf. What impact would this have on the quantity of gas supplied and the 
quantity demanded?
Substitute $3.00 for P
G in both the supply and 
demand equations (keeping the price of oil, PO, fixed 
at $50). You should find that the supply equation gives a quantity supplied of 20.6 Tcf and the demand equa-tion a quantity demanded of 29.1 Tcf. Therefore, these price controls would create an excess demand (i.e., shortage) of 29.1 -20.6=8.5
 Tcf. In Example 9.1 
we’ll show how to measure the resulting gains and loses to producers and consumers.
SUMMARY
 1. Supply-demand analysis is a basic tool of microeco-
nomics. In competitive markets, supply and demand curves tell us how much will be produced by firms and how much will be demanded by consumers as a function of price.
 2. The market mechanism is the tendency for supply and 
demand to equilibrate (i.e., for price to move to the market-clearing level), so that there is neither excess 
demand nor excess supply. The equilibrium price is the price that equates the quantity demanded with the quantity supplied.
 3. Elasticities describe the responsiveness of supply and 
demand to changes in price, income, or other  variables. For example, the price elasticity of demand measures 1950 1960 1970 1980

QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW
 1. Suppose that unusually hot weather causes the 
demand curve for ice cream to shift to the right. Why will the price of ice cream rise to a new market- clearing level?
 2. Use supply and demand curves to illustrate how each 
of the following events would affect the price of but-ter and the quantity of butter bought and sold: (a) an increase in the price of margarine; (b) an increase in the price of milk; (c) a decrease in average income  levels.
 3. If a 3-percent increase in the price of corn flakes causes 
a 6-percent decline in the quantity demanded, what is the elasticity of demand?
 4. Explain the difference between a shift in the supply 
curve and a movement along the supply curve.
 5. Explain why for many goods, the long-run price elas-
ticity of supply is larger than the short-run elasticity.
 6. Why do long-run elasticities of demand differ from 
short-run elasticities? Consider two goods: paper towels and televisions. Which is a durable good? Would you expect the price elasticity of demand for paper towels to be larger in the short run or in the long run? Why? What about the price elasticity of demand for televisions?
 7. Are the following statements true or false? Explain 
your answers.
 a. The elasticity of demand is the same as the slope of 
the demand curve.
 b. The cross-price elasticity will always be positive.
 c. The supply of apartments is more inelastic in the 
short run than the long run.
 8. Suppose the government regulates the prices of beef and 
chicken and sets them below their market-clearing levels. Explain why shortages of these goods will develop and what factors will determine the sizes of the shortages. What will happen to the price of pork? Explain briefly.
 9. The city council of a small college town decides to reg-
ulate rents in order to reduce student living expenses. Suppose the average annual market-clearing rent for a two-bedroom apartment had been $700 per month and that rents were expected to increase to $900 within 
a year. The city council limits rents to their current $700-per-month level.
 a. Draw a supply and demand graph to illustrate 
what will happen to the rental price of an apart-ment after the imposition of rent controls.
 b. Do you think this policy will benefit all students? 
Why or why not?
 10. In a discussion of tuition rates, a university official 
argues that the demand for admission is completely 
price inelastic. As evidence, she notes that while the university has doubled its tuition (in real terms) over the past 15 years, neither the number nor quality of students applying has decreased. Would you accept this argument? Explain briefly. ( Hint : The official 
makes an assertion about the demand for admission, but does she actually observe a demand curve? What else could be going on?)
 11. Suppose the demand curve for a product is given by
Q=10-2P+P
S
where P is the price of the product and PS is the price 
of a substitute good. The price of the substitute good is $2.00.
 a. Suppose P=$1.00. What is the price elasticity 
of demand? What is the cross-price elasticity of demand?
 b. Suppose the price of the good, P, goes to $2.00. 
Now what is the price elasticity of demand? What is the cross-price elasticity of demand?
 12. Suppose that rather than the declining demand 
assumed in Example 2.8, a decrease in the cost of copper production causes the supply curve to shift to the right by 40 percent. How will the price of copper change?
 13. Suppose the demand for natural gas is perfectly 
inelastic. What would be the effect, if any, of natural gas price controls?the percentage change in the quantity demanded resulting from a 1-percent increase in price.
 4. Elasticities pertain to a time frame, and for most goods 
it is important to distinguish between short-run and long-run elasticities.
 5. We can use supply-demand diagrams to see how shifts 
in the supply curve and/or demand curve can explain changes in the market price and quantity.
 6. If we can estimate, at least roughly, the supply and 
demand curves for a particular market, we can calcu-late the market-clearing price by equating the quantity supplied with the quantity demanded. Also, if we know how supply and demand depend on other economic variables, such as income or the prices of other goods, we can calculate how the market-clearing price and quan-
tity will change as these other variables change. This is a means of explaining or predicting market behavior.
 7. Simple numerical analyses can often be done by fit-
ting linear supply and demand curves to data on price and quantity and to estimates of elasticities. For many  markets, such data and estimates are available, and simple “back of the envelope” calculations can help us understand the characteristics and behavior of the market.
 8. When a government imposes price controls, it keeps 
the price below the level that equates supply and demand. A shortage develops; the quantity demanded 
exceeds the quantity supplied.62  PART 1   •  Introduction: Markets and Prices

 3. Refer to Example 2.5 (page 37) on the market for 
wheat. In 1998, the total demand for U.S. wheat was 
Q=3244 -283P and the domestic supply was 
QS=1944 +207P. At the end of 1998, both Brazil 
and Indonesia opened their wheat markets to U.S. farmers. Suppose that these new markets add 200 mil-lion  bushels to U.S. wheat demand. What will be the  free-market price of wheat and what quantity will be produced and sold by U.S. farmers?
 4. A vegetable fiber is traded in a competitive world mar-
ket, and the world price is $9 per pound. Unlimited quantities are available for import into the United States at this price. The U.S. domestic supply and demand for various price levels are shown as  follows:

demand? What is it at a price of $12?
 c. What is the price elasticity of supply at $9? At $12?
 d. In a free market, what will be the U.S. price and 
level of fiber imports?
 *5. Much of the demand for U.S. agricultural output has 
come from other countries. In 1998, the total demand for wheat was Q=3244 -283P. Of this, total domes-
tic demand was 
QD=1700 -107P, and domestic 
supply was QS=1944 +207P. Suppose the export 
demand for wheat falls by 40 percent.
 a. U.S. farmers are concerned about this drop in export 
demand. What happens to the free-market price of wheat in the United States? Do farmers have much reason to worry?
 b. Now suppose the U.S. government wants to buy 
enough wheat to raise the price to $3.50 per bushel. With the drop in export demand, how much wheat would the government have to buy? How much would this cost the government?
 6. The rent control agency of New York City has found 
that aggregate demand is Q
D=160-8P. Quantity is 
measured in tens of thousands of apartments. Price, the average monthly rental rate, is measured in hundreds of dollars. The agency also noted that the increase in Q at lower P results from more three-person families 
coming into the city from Long Island and demanding apartments. The city’s board of realtors acknowledges that this is a good demand estimate and has shown that supply is 
QS=70+7P.
 a. If both the agency and the board are right about 
demand and supply, what is the free-market price? What is the change in city population if the agency sets a maximum average monthly rent of $300 and all those who cannot find an apartment leave the city?
 b. Suppose the agency bows to the wishes of the board 
and sets a rental of $900 per month on all apart-ments to allow landlords a “fair” rate of return. If 50 percent of any long-run increases in apartment offerings comes from new construction, how many apartments are constructed?
 7. In 2010, Americans smoked 315 billion cigarettes, or 
15.75 billion packs of cigarettes. The average retail price (including taxes) was about $5.00 per pack. Statistical studies have shown that the price elasticity of demand is −0.4, and the price elasticity of supply is 0.5.
 a. Using this information, derive linear demand and 
supply curves for the cigarette market.
 b. In 1998, Americans smoked 23.5 billion packs of 
cigarettes, and the retail price was about $2.00 per pack. The decline in cigarette consumption from 1998 to 2010 was due in part to greater pub-lic awareness of the health hazards from smok-ing, but was also due in part to the increase in price. Suppose that the entire decline  was due to the CHAPTER 2   •  The Basics of Supply and Demand  63
increase in price. What could you deduce from that 
about the price elasticity of demand?
 8. In Example 2.8 we examined the effect of a 20-percent 
decline in copper demand on the price of copper, using the linear supply and demand curves developed in Section 2.6. Suppose the long-run price elasticity of copper demand were −0.75 instead of −0.5.
 a. Assuming, as before, that the equilibrium price and 
quantity are P* = $3 per pound and Q* = 18 mil-
lion metric tons per year, derive the linear demand curve consistent with the smaller elasticity.
 b. Using this demand curve, recalculate the effect of a 
20-percent decline in copper demand on the price of copper.
 9. In Example 2.8 (page 52), we discussed the recent 
increase in world demand for copper, due in part to China’s rising consumption.
 a. Using the original elasticities of demand and sup-
ply (i.e., E
S=1.5 and ED=-0.5), calculate the 
effect of a 20-percent increase  in copper demand on 
the price of copper.
 b. Now calculate the effect of this increase in demand 
on the equilibrium quantity, Q*.
 c. As we discussed in Example 2.8, the U.S. produc-
tion of copper declined between 2000 and 2003. Calculate the effect on the equilibrium price and quantity of both a 20-percent increase in copper 
demand (as you just did in part a) and of a 20-per-
cent decline in copper supply.
 10. Example 2.9 (page 54) analyzes the world oil market. 
Using the data given in that example:
 a. Show that the short-run demand and competitive 
supply curves are indeed given by
 D=33.6 -.020P

C=18.05 +0.012 P
 b. Show that the long-run demand and competitive 
supply curves are indeed given by
 D=41.6 -0.120 P
 SC=13.3 +0.071 P
 c. In Example 2.9 we examined the impact on price 
of a disruption of oil from Saudi Arabia. Suppose that instead of a decline in supply, OPEC produc-
tion increases  by 2 billion barrels per year (bb/yr) 
because the Saudis open large new oil fields. Calculate the effect of this increase in production on the price of oil in both the short run and the long run.
 11. Refer to Example 2.10 (page 59), which analyzes the 
effects of price controls on natural gas.
 a. Using the data in the example, show that the fol-
lowing supply and demand curves describe the market for natural gas in 2005–2007:
Supply : 
 Q=15.90 +0.72PG+0.05PO
Demand :  Q=0.02 -1.8PG+0.69PO
Also, verify that if the price of oil is $50, these curves 
imply a free-market price of $6.40 for natural gas.
 b. Suppose the regulated price of gas were $4.50 per 
thousand cubic feet instead of $3.00. How much excess demand would there have been?
 c. Suppose that the market for natural gas remained 
unregulated. If the price of oil had increased from $50 to $100, what would have happened to the free-market price of natural gas?

instant coffee and roasted coffee for two years.

elasticity of demand for roasted coffee. Derive a lin-ear demand curve for roasted coffee.
 b. Now estimate the short-run price elasticity of 
demand for instant coffee. Derive a linear demand curve for instant coffee.

Part Two
Part 2 presents the theoretical core of microeconomics.
Chapters 3 and 4 explain the principles underlying consumer 
demand. We see how consumers make consumption decisions, how their preferences and budget constraints determine their demands for various goods, and why different goods have different demand characteristics. Chapter 5 contains more advanced mate-rial that shows how to analyze consumer choice under uncertainty. We explain why people usually dislike risky situations and show how they can reduce risk and choose among risky alternatives. We also discuss aspects of consumer behavior that can only be explained by delving into the psychological aspects of how people make decisions.
Chapters 6 and 7 develop the theory of the firm. We see how 
firms combine inputs, such as capital, labor, and raw materials, to produce goods and services in a way that minimizes the costs of production. We also see how a firm’s costs depend on its rate of production and production experience. Chapter 8 then shows how firms choose profit-maximizing rates of production. We also see how the production decisions of individual firms combine to deter-mine the competitive market supply curve and its characteristics.
Chapter 9 applies supply and demand curves to the analysis of 
competitive markets. We show how government policies, such as price controls, quotas, taxes, and subsidies, can have wide-ranging effects on consumers and producers, and we explain how supply-demand analysis can be used to evaluate these effects.Producers, Consumers,

Some time ago, General Mills introduced a new breakfast cereal. 
The new brand, Apple-Cinnamon Cheerios, was a sweetened and more flavorful variant on General Mills’ classic Cheerios product. 
But before Apple-Cinnamon Cheerios could be extensively  marketed, the company had to resolve an important problem: How high a price 
should it charge?  No matter how good the cereal was, its profitabil-
ity would depend on the company’s pricing decision. Knowing that consumers would pay more for a new product was not enough. The question was how much more.  General Mills, therefore, had to conduct a 
careful analysis of consumer preferences to determine the demand for Apple-Cinnamon Cheerios.
General Mills’ problem in determining consumer preferences 
 mirrors the more complex problem faced by the U.S. Congress in eval-uating the federal Food Stamps program. The goal of the program is to give low-income households coupons that can be exchanged for food. But there has always been a problem in the program’s design that  complicates its assessment: To what extent do food stamps pro-vide people with more  food, as opposed to simply subsidizing the 
purchase of food that they would have bought anyway? In other words, has the program turned out to be little more than an income supplement that people spend largely on nonfood items instead of a solution to the nutritional problems of the poor? As in the cereal example, we need an analysis of consumer behavior. In this case, the federal government must determine how spending on food, as opposed to spending on other goods, is affected by changing income levels and prices.
Solving these two problems—one involving corporate policy and 
the other public policy—requires an understanding of the theory 
of consumer behavior:  the explanation of how consumers allocate 
incomes to the purchase of different goods and services.
Consumer Behavior
How can a consumer with a limited income decide which goods and services to buy? This is a fundamental issue in microeconomics—one that we address in this chapter and the next. We will see how con-sumers allocate their incomes across goods and explain how these  allocation decisions determine the demands for various goods and 3.1

services. In turn, understanding consumer purchasing decisions will help us to 
understand how changes in income and prices affect the demand for goods and services and why the demand for some products is more sensitive than others to changes in prices and income.
Consumer behavior is best understood in three distinct steps:
 1. Consumer Preferences:  The first step is to find a practical way to describe 
the reasons people might prefer one good to another. We will see how a consumer’s preferences  for various goods can be described graphically and 
algebraically.
 2. Budget Constraints:  Of course, consumers also consider prices.  In Step 2, 
therefore, we take into account the fact that consumers have limited incomes which restrict the quantities of goods they can buy. What does a consumer do in this situation? We find the answer to this question by  putting consumer preferences and budget constraints together in the third step.
 3. Consumer Choices:  Given their preferences and limited incomes, consum-
ers choose to buy combinations of goods that maximize their satisfaction. These combinations will depend on the prices of various goods. Thus,  understanding consumer choice will help us understand demand —i.e., 
how the quantity of a good that consumers choose to purchase depends on its price.
These three steps are the basics of consumer theory, and we will go through 
them in detail in the first three sections of this chapter. Afterward, we will explore a number of other interesting aspects of consumer behavior. For  example, we will see how one can determine the nature of consumer preferences from actual observations of consumer behavior. Thus, if a consumer chooses one good over a similarly priced alternative, we can infer that he or she prefers the first good. Similar kinds of conclusions can be drawn from the actual decisions that  consumers make in response to changes in the prices of the various goods and services that are available for purchase.
At the end of this chapter, we will return to the discussion of real and nomi-
nal prices that we began in Chapter 1. We saw that the Consumer Price Index can provide one measure of how the well-being of consumers changes over time. In this chapter, we delve more deeply into the subject of purchasing power by describing a range of indexes that measure changes in purchasing power over time. Because they affect the benefits and costs of numerous social-welfare programs, these indexes are significant tools in setting government policy in the United States.
WHAT DO CONSUMERS DO?  Before proceeding, we need to be clear about 
our assumptions regarding consumer behavior, and whether those assump-tions are realistic. It is hard to argue with the proposition that consumers have preferences among the various goods and services available to them, and that they face budget constraints which put limits on what they can buy. But we might take issue with the proposition that consumers decide which combinations of goods and services to buy so as to maximize their satisfac-tion. Are consumers as rational and informed as economists often make them out to be?
We know that consumers do not always make purchasing decisions 
 rationally. Sometimes, for example, they buy on impulse, ignoring or not • theory of consumer 
behavior  Description of how 
consumers allocate incomes 
among different g oods and 
services to maximize their  well-being.CHAPTER 3   •  Consumer Behavior  69
fully accounting for their budget constraints (and going into debt as a result). 
Sometimes consumers are unsure about their preferences or are swayed by the consumption  decisions of friends and neighbors, or even by changes in mood. And even if consumers do behave rationally, it may not always be fea-sible for them to account fully for the multitude of prices and choices that they face daily.
Economists have recently been developing models of consumer behavior 
that incorporate more realistic assumptions about rationality and decision making. This area of research, called behavioral economics , has drawn heav-
ily from findings in psychology and related fields. We will discuss some key results from behavioral economics in Chapter 5. At this point we simply want to make it clear that our basic model of consumer behavior necessarily makes some simplifying assumptions. But we also want to emphasize that this model has been extremely successful in explaining much of what we  actually observe regarding consumer choice and the characteristics of con-sumer demand. As a result, this model is a basic “workhorse” of economics. It is used widely, not only in  economics, but also in related fields such as finance and marketing.
3.1  Consumer Preferences
Given both the vast number of goods and services that our industrial economy provides for purchase and the diversity of personal tastes, how can we describe consumer preferences in a coherent way? Let’s begin by thinking about how a consumer might compare different groups of items available for purchase. Will one group of items be preferred to another group, or will the consumer be indif-ferent between the two groups?
Market Baskets
We use the term market basket  to refer to such a group of items. Specifically, a 
market basket  is a list with specific quantities of one or more goods. A mar-
ket basket might contain the various food items in a grocery cart. It might also refer to the quantities of food, clothing, and housing that a consumer buys each month. Many economists also use the word bundle  to mean the same thing as 
market basket.
How do consumers select market baskets? How do they decide, for example, 
how much food versus clothing to buy each month? Although selections may occasionally be arbitrary, as we will soon see, consumers usually select market baskets that make them as well off as possible.
Table 3.1 shows several market baskets consisting of various amounts of 
food and clothing purchased on a monthly basis. The number of food items can be measured in any number of ways: by total number of containers, by number of packages of each item (e.g., milk, meat, etc.), or by number of pounds or grams. Likewise, clothing can be counted as total number of pieces, as number of pieces of each type of clothing, or as total weight or  volume. Because the method of measurement is largely arbitrary, we will simply describe the items in a market basket in terms of the total number of units  of 
each commodity. Market basket A, for example, consists of 20 units of food 
and 30 units of clothing, basket B consists of 10 units of food and 50 units of 
clothing, and so on.• market basket ( or bundle)

Note:  We will avoid the use of the letters C and F to represent market baskets, whenever market baskets might be 
confused with the number of units of food and clothing.
To explain the theory of consumer behavior, we will ask whether consumers 
prefer  one market basket to another. Note that the theory assumes that consumers’ 
preferences are consistent and make sense. We explain what we mean by these assumptions in the next subsection.
Some Basic Assumptions about Preferences
The theory of consumer behavior begins with three basic assumptions about people’s preferences for one market basket versus another. We believe that these assumptions hold for most people in most situations.
 1. Completeness:  Preferences are assumed to be complete.  In other words, 
consumers can compare and rank all possible baskets. Thus, for any two market baskets A and B, a consumer will prefer A to B, will prefer B to A, 
or will be indifferent between the two. By indifferent  we mean that a per-
son will be equally satisfied with either basket. Note that these preferences ignore costs. A consumer might prefer steak to hamburger but buy ham-burger because it is cheaper.
 2. Transitivity: Preferences are transitive.  Transitivity means that if a consumer 
prefers basket A to basket B and basket B to basket C, then the consumer 
also prefers A to C. For example, if a Porsche is preferred to a Cadillac and 
a Cadillac to a Chevrolet, then a Porsche is also preferred to a Chevrolet. Transitivity is normally regarded as necessary for consumer consistency.
 3. More is better than less: Goods are assumed to be desirable—i.e., to be 
good.  Consequently, consumers always prefer more of any good to less.  In addi-
tion, consumers are never satisfied or satiated; more is always better, even if 
just a little better.
1 This assumption is made for pedagogic reasons; name-
ly, it simplifies the graphical analysis. Of course, some goods, such as air pollution, may be undesirable, and consumers will always prefer less. We  ignore these “bads” in the context of our immediate discussion of consumer choice because most consumers would not choose to purchase them. We will, however, discuss them later in the chapter.
These three assumptions form the basis of consumer theory. They do not 
explain consumer preferences, but they do impose a degree of rationality and reasonableness on them. Building on these assumptions, we will now explore  consumer behavior in greater detail.
1Thus some economists use the term nonsatiation  to refer to this third assumption.CHAPTER 3   •  Consumer Behavior  71
Indifference Curves
We can show a consumer’s preferences graphically with the use of indifference 
curves.  An indifference curve  represents all combinations of market baskets that pro-
vide a consumer with the same level of satisfaction.  That person is therefore indiffer-
ent among the market baskets represented by the points graphed on the curve.
Given our three assumptions about preferences, we know that a consumer 
can always indicate either a preference for one market basket over another or indifference between the two. We can then use this information to rank all pos-sible consumption choices. In order to appreciate this principle in graphic form, let’s assume that there are only two goods available for consumption: food F 
and clothing C. In this case, all market baskets describe combinations of food 
and clothing that a person might wish to consume. As we have already seen, Table 3.1 provides some examples of baskets containing various amounts of food and clothing.
In order to graph a consumer’s indifference curve, it helps first to graph his or 
her individual preferences. Figure 3.1 shows the same baskets listed in Table 3.1. The horizontal axis measures the number of units of food purchased each week; the vertical axis measures the number of units of clothing. Market basket A, with 
20 units of food and 30 units of clothing, is preferred to basket G because A con-
tains more food and more clothing (recall our third assumption that more is better 
than less). Similarly, market basket E, which contains even more food and even 
more clothing, is preferred to A. In fact, we can easily compare all market baskets 
in the two shaded areas (such as E and G) to A because they contain either more 
or less of both food and clothing. Note, however, that B contains more cloth-
ing but less food than A. Similarly, D contains more food but less clothing than 
A. Therefore, comparisons of market basket A with baskets B, D, and H are not 
 possible without more information about the consumer’s ranking.
This additional information is provided in Figure 3.2, which shows an indiffer-
ence curve, labeled U
1, that passes through points A, B, and D. This curve indi-
cates that the consumer is indifferent among these three market baskets. It tells us that in moving from market basket A to market basket B, the consumer feels 
neither better nor worse off in giving up 10 units of food to obtain 20 additional • indifference curve  Curve

DESCRIBING INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES
Because more of each good is preferred to 
less, we can compare market baskets in the shaded areas. Basket A is clearly preferred 
to basket G, while E is clearly preferred to A. 
However, A cannot be compared with B, D, or 
H without additional  information.72  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets 
units of clothing. Likewise, the consumer is indifferent between points A and D: 
He or she will give up 10 units of clothing to obtain 20 more units of food. On the other hand, the consumer prefers A to H, which lies below U
1.
Note that the indifference curve in Figure 3.2 slopes downward from left to right. 
To understand why this must be the case, suppose instead that it sloped upward from A to E. This would violate the assumption that more of any  commodity is 
preferred to less. Because market basket E has more of both food and clothing than 
market basket A, it must be preferred to A and therefore cannot be on the same 
indifference curve as A. In fact, any market basket lying above and to the right of  
indifference curve U
1 in Figure 3.2 is preferred to any market basket on U1.
Indifference Maps
To describe a person’s preferences for all combinations of food and clothing, we 
can graph a set of indifference curves called an indifference map.  Each indif-
ference curve in the map shows the market baskets among which the person is indifferent. Figure 3.3 shows three indifference curves that form part of an indifference map (the entire map includes an infinite number of such curves). Indifference curve U
3 generates the highest level of satisfaction, followed by 
indifference curves U2 and U1.
Indifference curves cannot intersect. To see why, we will assume the con-
trary and see how the resulting graph violates our assumptions about consumer behavior. Figure 3.4 shows two indifference curves, U
1 and U2, that intersect 
at A. Because A and B are both on indifference curve U1, the consumer must 
be indifferent between these two market baskets. Because both A and D lie on 
indifference curve U2, the consumer is also indifferent between these market 
baskets. Consequently, using the assumption of transitivity, the consumer is also • indifference map  Graph

AN INDIFFERENCE CURVE
The indifference curve U1 that passes 
through market basket A shows all baskets 
that give the consumer the same level of satisfaction as does market basket A; these 
include baskets B and D. Our consumer 
prefers basket E, which lies above U
1, to A, 
but prefers A to H or G, which lie below U1.CHAPTER 3   •  Consumer Behavior  73
indifferent between B and D. But this conclusion can’t be true: Market basket 
B must be preferred to D because it contains more of both food and clothing. 
Thus, intersecting indifference curves contradicts our assumption that more is preferred to less.
Of course, there are an infinite number of  nonintersecting indifference curves, 
one for every possible level of satisfaction. In fact, every possible market  basket (each corresponding to a point on the graph) has an indifference curve passing through it.
The Shape of Indifference Curves
Recall that indifference curves are all downward sloping. In our example of food and clothing, when the amount of food increases along an indifference curve, the amount of clothing decreases. The fact that indifference curves slope downward follows directly from our assumption that more of a good is better than less. If an indifference curve sloped upward, a consumer would be indif-ferent between two market baskets even though one of them had more of both 
food and  clothing.
As we saw in Chapter 1, people face trade-offs. The shape of an indifference 
curve describes how a consumer is willing to substitute one good for another. Look, for example, at the indifference curve in Figure 3.5. Starting at market 
basket A and moving to basket B, we see that the consumer is willing to give up 
6 units of clothing to obtain 1 extra unit of food. However, in moving from B to 
D, he is willing to give up only 4 units of clothing to obtain an additional unit of U1U2Clothing

INDIFFERENCE CURVES CANNOT INTERSECT
If indifference curves U1 and U2 intersect, one of the 
 assumptions of consumer theory is violated. Accord-
ing to this diagram, the consumer should be indiffer-ent among market baskets A, B, and D. Yet B should be 
 preferred to D because B has more of both goods.FIGURE 3.3
AN INDIFFERENCE MAP
An indifference map is a set of indifference curves that 
 describes a person’s preferences. Any market basket on 
indifference curve U3, such as basket A, is preferred to 
any basket on curve U2 (e.g., basket B), which in turn is 
preferred to any basket on U1, such as D.U1U2U3Clothing

food; in moving from D to E, he will give up only 2 units of clothing for 1 unit 
of food. The more clothing and the less food a person consumes, the more cloth-ing he will give up in order to obtain more food. Similarly, the more food that a person possesses, the less clothing he will give up for more food.
The Marginal Rate of Substitution
To quantify the amount of one good that a consumer will give up to obtain more of another, we use a measure called the marginal rate of substitution (MRS).  
The MRS of food F for clothing C is the maximum amount of clothing that a person is willing to give up to obtain one additional unit of food.  Suppose, for example, the 
MRS is 3. This means that the consumer will give up 3 units of clothing to obtain 1 additional unit of food. If the MRS is 1/2, the consumer is willing to give up only 1/2 unit of clothing. Thus, the MRS measures the value that the individual 
places on 1 extra unit of a good in terms of another.
Look again at Figure 3.5. Note that clothing appears on the vertical axis 
and food on the horizontal axis. When we describe the MRS, we must be clear about which good we are giving up and which we are getting more of. To be consistent throughout the book, we will define the MRS in terms of the amount 
of the good on the vertical axis that the consumer is willing to give up in order to obtain 1 extra unit of the good on the horizontal axis.  Thus, in Figure 3.5 the MRS 
refers to the amount of clothing that the consumer is willing to give up to obtain an additional unit of food. If we denote the change  in clothing by /H9004C 
and the change in food by /H9004F, the MRS can be written as -/H9004C//H9004F. We add 
the negative sign to make the  marginal rate of substitution a positive num-ber. (Remember that /H9004C is always negative; the consumer gives up  clothing to 
obtain additional food.)• marginal rate of

THE MARGINAL RATE  
OF SUBSTITUTION
The magnitude of the slope of an indifference 
curve measures the consumer’s marginal rate of substitution (MRS) between two goods. In this figure, the MRS between clothing ( C) and 
food ( F) falls from 6 (between A and B) to 4 
(between B and D) to 2 (between D and E) 
to 1 (between E and G). When the MRS 
 diminishes along an indifference curve, the 
curve is convex.CHAPTER 3   •  Consumer Behavior  75
Thus the MRS at any point is equal in magnitude to the slope of the indiffer-
ence curve. In Figure 3.5, for example, the MRS between points A and B is 6: The 
consumer is willing to give up 6 units of clothing to obtain 1 additional unit of food. Between points B and D, however, the MRS is 4: With these quantities of 
food and clothing, the consumer is willing to give up only 4 units of clothing to obtain 1 additional unit of food.
CONVEXITY  Also observe in Figure 3.5 that the MRS falls as we move down 
the indifference curve. This is not a coincidence. This decline in the MRS reflects an important characteristic of consumer preferences. To understand this, we will add an additional assumption regarding consumer preferences to the three that we discussed earlier in this chapter (see page 70):
 4. Diminishing marginal rate of substitution: Indifference curves are usu-
ally convex , or bowed inward. The term convex  means that the slope of the 
indifference curve increases  (i.e., becomes less negative) as we move down 
along the curve. In other words, an indifference curve is convex if the MRS 
diminishes along the curve.  The indifference curve in Figure 3.5 is convex. 
As we have seen, starting with market basket A in Figure 3.5 and moving 
to basket B, the MRS of food F for clothing C is -/H9004C//H9004F=-(-6)/1=6. 
However, when we start at basket B and move from B to D, the MRS falls 
to 4. If we start at basket D and move to E, the MRS is 2. Starting at E 
and moving to G, we get an MRS of 1. As food consumption increases, 
the slope of the indifference curve falls in magnitude. Thus the MRS also falls.
2
Is it reasonable to expect indifference curves to be convex? Yes. As more and 
more of one good is consumed, we can expect that a consumer will prefer to give up fewer and fewer units of a second good to get additional units of the first one. As we move down the indifference curve in Figure 3.5 and consump-tion of food increases, the additional satisfaction that a consumer gets from still more food will diminish. Thus, he will give up less and less clothing to obtain additional food.
Another way of describing this principle is to say that consumers generally 
prefer balanced market baskets to market baskets that contain all of one good and none of another. Note from Figure 3.5 that a relatively balanced market bas-ket containing 3 units of food and 6 units of clothing (basket D) generates as 
much satisfaction as another market basket containing 1 unit of food and 16 units of clothing (basket A). It follows that a balanced market basket containing, 
for example, 6 units of food and 8 units of clothing will generate a higher level of satisfaction.
Perfect Substitutes and Perfect Complements
The shape of an indifference curve describes the willingness of a consumer to substitute one good for another. An indifference curve with a different shape implies a different willingness to substitute. To see this principle, look at the two somewhat extreme cases illustrated in Figure 3.6.In §2.1, we explain that two 
goods are substitutes  when 
an increase in the price of one leads to an increase in the quantity demanded of the other.
2With nonconvex preferences, the MRS increases as the amount of the good measured on the hori-
zontal axis increases along any indifference curve. This unlikely possibility might arise if one or both goods are addictive. For example, the willingness to substitute an addictive drug for other goods might increase as the use of the addictive drug increased.76  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets

PERFECT SUBSTITUTES AND PERFECT COMPLEMENTS
In (a), Bob views orange juice and apple juice as perfect substitutes: He is always indifferent 
between a glass of one and a glass of the other. In (b), Jane views left shoes and right shoes 
as perfect complements: An additional left shoe gives her no extra satisfaction unless she also obtains the matching right shoe.
Figure 3.6 (a) shows Bob’s preferences for apple juice and orange juice. 
These two goods are perfect substitutes for Bob because he is entirely indiffer-ent between having a glass of one or the other. In this case, the MRS of apple juice for orange juice is 1: Bob is always willing to trade 1 glass of one for 1 glass of the other. In general, we say that two goods are perfect  substitutes  
when the marginal rate of substitution of one for the other is a constant. Indifference curves describing the trade-off between the consumption of the goods are straight lines. The slope of the indifference curves need not be /H110021 
in the case of perfect substitutes. Suppose, for example, that Dan believes that one 16-megabyte memory chip is equivalent to two 8-megabyte chips because both combinations have the same memory capacity. In that case, the slope of Dan’s indifference curve will be /H110022 (with the number of 8-megabyte chips on 
the vertical axis).
Figure 3.6 (b) illustrates Jane’s preferences for left shoes and right shoes. 
For Jane, the two goods are perfect complements because a left shoe will not increase her satisfaction unless she can obtain the matching right shoe. In this case, the MRS of left shoes for right shoes is zero whenever there are more right shoes than left shoes; Jane will not give up any left shoes to get additional right shoes. Correspondingly, the MRS is infinite whenever there are more left shoes than right because Jane will give up all but one of her excess left shoes in order to obtain an additional right shoe. Two goods are perfect complements  when the indifference curves for both are shaped as 
right angles.
BADS  So far, all of our examples have involved products that are “goods”—i.e., 
cases in which more of a product is preferred to less. However, some things are bads:  Less of them is preferred to more.  Air pollution is a bad; asbestos in housing • perfect substitutes  Two

EXAMPLE 3.1  DESIGNING NEW AUTOMOBILES (I)
Suppose you worked for the Ford 
Motor Company and had to help plan 
new models to introduce. Should the 
new models emphasize interior space 
or handling? Horsepower or gas mile-
age? To decide, you would want to 
know how people value the various 
attributes of a car, such as power, size, 
handling, gas mileage, interior fea-
tures, and so on. The more desirable the attributes, 
the more people would be willing to pay for a car. 
However, the better the attributes, the more the car 
will cost to manufacture. A car with a more power-
ful engine and more interior space, for example, 
will cost more to produce than a car with a smaller 
engine and less space. How should Ford trade off 
these different attributes and decide which ones to 
emphasize?
The answer depends in part on the cost of pro-
duction, but it also depends on consumer pref-
erences. To find out how much people are will-
ing to pay for various attributes, economists and 
marketing experts look at the prices that people 
actually do pay for a wide range of models with a 
range of attributes. For example, if the only dif-
ference between two cars is interior space, and if 
the car with 2 additional cubic feet sells for $1000 
more than its smaller counterpart, then interior 
space will be valued at $500 per cubic foot. By 
evaluating car purchases over a range of buy-
ers and a range of models, one can estimate the values associated with various 
attributes, while accounting for 
the fact that these valuations 
may diminish as more and more 
of each attribute is included in 
a car. One way to obtain such 
information is by conducting 
surveys in which individuals are 
asked about their preferences 
for various automobiles with different combina-
tions of attributes. Another way is to statistically 
analyze past consumer purchases of cars whose 
attributes varied.
One recent statistical study looked at a 
wide range of Ford models with varying attributes.3 
Figure 3.7 describes two sets of indifference curves, 
derived from an analysis that varies two attributes: 
interior  size (measured in cubic feet) and accelera-
tion  (measured in horsepower) for typical consum-
ers of Ford automobiles.  Figure 3.7 (a) describes 
the preferences of typical owners of Ford Mustang 
coupes. Because they tend to place greater value 
on acceleration than size, Mustang owners have a 
high marginal rate of substitution for size versus 
acceleration; in other words, they are willing to 
give up quite a bit of size to get better accelera-
tion. Compare these preferences to those of Ford 
Explorer owners, shown in Figure 3.7 (b). They have 
a lower MRS and will consequently give up a con-
siderable amount of acceleration to get a car with a 
roomier interior.

Economy  110 (2002): 705–729. We wish to thank Amil Petrin for providing some of the empirical 
 information in this example.
insulation is another. How do we account for bads in the analysis of consumer 
preferences?
The answer is simple: We redefine the product under study so that consumer 
tastes are represented as a preference for less of the bad. This reversal turns the 
bad into a good. Thus, for example, instead of a preference for air pollution, we 
will discuss the preference for clean air, which we can measure as the degree of 
reduction in air pollution. Likewise, instead of referring to asbestos as a bad, we 
will refer to the corresponding good, the removal of asbestos.
With this simple adaptation, all four of the basic assumptions of consumer 
theory continue to hold, and we are ready to move on to an analysis of consumer 
budget constraints.78  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets

PREFERENCES FOR AUTOMOBILE ATTRIBUTES
Preferences for automobile attributes can be described by indifference curves. Each curve shows the combination of 
acceleration and interior space that give the same satisfaction. Owners of Ford Mustang coupes (a) are willing to give 
up considerable interior space for additional acceleration. The opposite is true for owners of Ford Explorers (b).
UTILITY  You may have noticed a convenient feature of the theory of consumer 
behavior as we have described it so far: It has not been necessary to associate a 
numerical level of satisfaction with each market basket consumed.  For example, with 
respect to the three indifference curves in Figure 3.3 (page 73), we know that market basket A (or any other basket on indifference curve U
3) gives more 
satisfaction than any market basket on U2, such as B. Likewise, we know that 
the market baskets on U2 are preferred to those on U1. The indifference curves 
simply allow us to describe consumer preferences graphically, building on the assumption that consumers can rank alternatives.
We will see that consumer theory relies only on the assumption that con-
sumers can provide relative rankings of market baskets. Nonetheless, it is often useful to assign numerical values  to individual baskets. Using this numer-
ical approach, we can describe consumer preferences by assigning scores to the levels of satisfaction associated with each indifference curve. The concept is known as utility. In everyday language, the word utility  has rather broad 
connotations, meaning, roughly, “benefit” or “well-being.” Indeed, people obtain “utility” by getting things that give them pleasure and by avoiding things that give them pain. In the language of economics, the concept of  utility  refers to the numerical score representing the satisfaction that a consumer 
gets from a market basket.  In other words, utility is a device used to simplify 
the ranking of market baskets. If buying three copies of this textbook makes you happier than buying one shirt, then we say that the three books give you more utility than the shirt.

UTILITY FUNCTIONS  A utility function  is a formula that assigns a level of util-
ity to each market basket. Suppose, for example, that Phil’s utility function for food ( F) and clothing ( C) is u(F,C) /H11005 F /H11001 2C. In that case, a market basket con-
sisting of 8 units of food and 3 units of clothing generates a utility of 8 /H11001 (2)(3) /H11005 
14. Phil is therefore indifferent between this market basket and a market basket containing 6 units of food and 4 units of clothing [6 /H11001 (2)(4) /H11005 14]. On the other 
hand, either market basket is preferred to a third containing 4 units of food and 4 units of clothing. Why? Because this last market basket has a utility level of only 4 /H11001 (4)(2) /H11005 12.
We assign utility levels to market baskets so that if market basket A is pre-
ferred to basket B, the number will be higher for A than for B. For example, 
market basket A on the highest of three indifference curves U
3 might have a 
utility level of 3, while market basket B on the second-highest indifference curve 
U2 might have a utility level of 2; on the lowest indifference curve U1, basket D 
has a utility level of 1. Thus the utility function provides the same information about preferences that an indifference map does: Both order consumer choices in terms of levels of satisfaction.
Let’s examine one particular utility function in some detail. The utility 
 function  u(F,C) /H11005 FC tells us that the level of satisfaction obtained from consum-
ing F units of food and C units of clothing is the product of F and C. Figure 3.8 
shows indifference curves associated with this function. The graph was drawn by initially choosing one particular market basket—say, F /H11005 5 and C /H11005 5 at point 
A. This market basket generates a utility level U
1 of 25. Then the indifference 
curve (also called an isoutility curve ) was drawn by finding all market baskets 
for which FC /H11005 25 (e.g., F /H11005 10, C /H11005 2.5 at point B; F /H11005 2.5, C /H11005 10 at point D). 
The second indifference curve, U2, contains all market baskets for which FC /H11005 50 
and the third, U3, all market baskets for which FC /H11005 100.
It is important to note that the numbers attached to the indifference curves 
are for convenience only. Suppose the utility function were changed to u(F,C) 
/H11005 4FC. Consider any market basket that previously generated a utility level 
of 25—say, F /H11005 5 and C /H11005 5. Now the level of utility has increased, by a factor 
of 4, to 100. Thus the indifference curve labeled 25 looks the same, although it should now be labeled 100 rather than 25. In fact, the only difference between the indifference curves associated with the utility function 4 FC and the utility • utility function  Formula

UTILITY FUNCTIONS AND INDIFFERENCE CURVES
A utility function can be represented by a set of indifference 
curves, each with a numerical indicator. This figure shows three indifference curves (with utility levels of 25, 50, and 100, respectively) associated with the utility function FC.80  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets 
function FC is that the curves are numbered 100, 200, and 400, rather than 25, 
50, and 100. It is important to stress that the utility function is simply a way of ranking  different market baskets; the magnitude  of the utility difference between 
any two market baskets does not really tell us anything. The fact that U
3 has a 
level of utility of 100 and U2 has a level of 50 does not mean that market baskets 
on U3 generate twice as much satisfaction as those on U2. This is so because we 
have no means of objectively measuring a person’s satisfaction or level of well-being from the consumption of a market basket. Thus whether we use indif-ference curves or a measure of utility, we know only that U
3 is better than U2 
and that U2 is better than U1. We do not, however, know by how much  one is 
preferred to the other.
ORDINAL VERSUS CARDINAL UTILITY  The three indifference curves in 
Figure 3.3 (page 73) provide a ranking of market baskets that is ordered, or ordi-
nal. For this reason, a utility function that generates a ranking of market baskets 
is called an ordinal utility function.  The ranking associated with the ordinal 
utility function places market baskets in the order of most to least preferred. However, as explained above, it does not indicate by how much  one is preferred 
to another. We know, for example, that any market basket on U
3, such as A, is 
preferred to any on U2, such as B. However, the amount  by which A is preferred 
to B (and B to D) is not revealed by the indifference map or by the ordinal utility 
function that generates it.
When working with ordinal utility functions, we must be careful to avoid a 
trap. Suppose that Juan’s ordinal utility function attaches a utility level of 5 to a copy of this textbook; meanwhile Maria’s utility function attaches a level of 10. Will Maria be happier than Juan if each of them gets a copy of this book? We don’t know. Because these numerical values are arbitrary, interpersonal  comparisons of utility are impossible.
When economists first studied utility and utility functions, they hoped that 
individual preferences could be quantified or measured in terms of basic units and could therefore provide a ranking that allowed for interpersonal compari-sons. Using this approach, we could say that Maria gets twice as much satisfac-tion as Juan from a copy of this book. Or if we found that having a second copy increased Juan’s utility level to 10, we could say that his happiness has doubled. If the numerical values assigned to market baskets did have meaning in this way, we would say that the numbers provided a cardinal  ranking of alternatives. 
A utility function that describes by how much  one market basket is preferred to 
another is called a cardinal utility function.  Unlike ordinal utility functions, a 
cardinal utility function attaches to market baskets numerical values that cannot arbitrarily be doubled or tripled without altering the differences between the values of various market baskets.
Unfortunately, we have no way of telling whether a person gets twice as 
much satisfaction from one market basket as from another. Nor do we know whether one person gets twice as much satisfaction as another from consum-ing the same basket. (Could you tell whether you get twice as much satisfaction 
from consuming one thing versus another?) Fortunately, this constraint is unim-portant. Because our objective is to understand consumer behavior, all that mat-ters is knowing how consumers rank different baskets. Therefore, we will work only with ordinal utility functions. This approach is sufficient for understanding both how individual consumer decisions are made and what this knowledge implies about the characteristics of consumer demand.• ordinal utility function

EXAMPLE 3.2  CAN MONEY BUY HAPPINESS?
Economists use the term utility  to represent a 
measure of the satisfaction or happiness that indi-viduals get from the consumption of goods and services. Because a higher income allows one to consume more goods and services, we say that utility increases with income. But does greater income and consumption really translate into greater happiness? Research comparing various measures of happiness suggests that the answer is a qualified yes.
4
In one study, an ordinal scale for happiness was 
derived from the answer to the following question. “How satisfied are you at present with your life, all things considered?”
5 Possible responses ran on a 
scale from 0 (completely dissatisfied) to 10 (com-pletely satisfied). Income was found to be a very strong predictor of happiness (another strong predictor was whether a person was employed or not). On average, as income increased by one percent, the satisfaction score increased one half a point. Knowing that there is a positive relation-ship between utility or satisfaction and income, it is reasonable to assign utility values to the baskets of goods and services that consumers buy. Whether that relationship is cardinal or ordinal remains an ongoing debate.
Let’s take this inquiry one step further. Can one 
compare levels of happiness across  as well as within  
countries? Once again, the evidence says yes. In a  separate survey of individuals in 67 countries, a 
team of researchers asked: “All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days?” Responses were given on a ten-point scale, with 1 representing the most dissatisfied and 10 the most satisfied.
6 Income was measured by each 
country’s per-capita gross domestic product in U.S. dollars. Figure 3.9 shows the results, with each data 
point representing a different country. You can see that as we move from poor countries with incomes below $5000 per capita to those with incomes closer to $10,000 per capita, satisfaction increases substantially. Once we move past the $10,000 level, the index scale of satisfaction increases at a lower rate.
Comparisons across countries are difficult 
because there are likely to be many other fac-tors that explain satisfaction besides income (e.g., health, climate, political environment, human rights, etc.). Interestingly, a recent survey of 136,000 indi-viduals over 132 countries shows that the United States, which had the highest GDP per capita, was ranked 16th overall in happiness. The number 1 rated country was Denmark. Generally, countries in Northern Europe and English-speaking countries 
did well overall, as did a number of Latin American countries. However, South Korea and Russia were not rated as high as their incomes would predict. Does location affect feelings of well-being within the United States? The answer is apparently yes, with the top-ranked states (in order) being Utah, Hawaii, Wyoming, and Colorado, all west of the Mississippi River. (The lowest four, in reverse order, were West Virginia, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Ohio, all east of the Mississippi.) Moreover, it is possible that the relationship between income and satisfaction goes two ways: Although higher incomes generate more satisfaction, greater sat-isfaction offers greater motivation for individu-als to work hard and generate higher incomes. Interestingly, even when studies account for other factors, the positive relationship between income and satisfaction remains.

3.2  Budget Constraints
So far, we have focused only on the first element of consumer theory—consumer 
preferences. We have seen how indifference curves (or, alternatively, utility func-tions) can be used to describe how consumers value various baskets of goods. Now we turn to the second element of consumer theory: the budget constraints  
that consumers face as a result of their limited incomes.
The Budget Line
To see how a budget constraint limits a consumer’s choices, let’s consider a situ-ation in which a woman has a fixed amount of income, I, that can be spent on 
food and clothing. Let F be the amount of food purchased and C be the amount 
of clothing. We will denote the prices of the two goods P
F and PC. In that case, 
PFF (i.e., price of food times the quantity) is the amount of money spent on food 
and PCC the amount of money spent on clothing.
The budget line  indicates all combinations of F and C for which the total amount 
of money spent is equal to income.  Because we are considering only two goods (and 
ignoring the possibility of saving), our hypothetical consumer will spend her entire income on food and clothing. As a result, the combinations of food and clothing that she can buy will all lie on this line:

A cross-country comparison shows that individuals living in countries with higher GDP per

Suppose, for example, that our consumer has a weekly income of $80, the 
price of food is $1 per unit, and the price of clothing is $2 per unit. Table 3.2 shows various combinations of food and clothing that she can purchase each week with her $80. If her entire budget were allocated to clothing, the most that she could buy would be 40 units (at a price of $2 per unit), as repre-sented by market basket A. If she spent her entire budget on food, she could 
buy 80 units (at $1 per unit), as given by market basket G. Market baskets B, 
D, and E show three additional ways in which her $80 could be spent on food 
and clothing.
Figure 3.10 shows the budget line associated with the market baskets given in 
Table 3.2. Because giving up a unit of clothing saves $2 and buying a unit of food costs $1, the amount of clothing given up for food along the budget line must be the same everywhere. As a result, the budget line is a straight line from point A to point 
G. In this particular case, the budget line is given by the equation F /H11001 2C /H11005 $80.
The intercept of the budget line is represented by basket A. As our consumer 
moves along the line from basket A to basket G, she spends less on clothing and 
more on food. It is easy to see that the extra clothing which must be given up to consume an additional unit of food is given by the ratio of the price of food to the price of clothing ($1/$2 /H11005 1/2). Because clothing costs $2 per unit and food 
only $1 per unit, 1/2 unit of clothing must be given up to get 1 unit of food. In Figure 3.10, the slope of the line, /H9004C//H9004F /H11005 −1/2, measures the relative cost of 
food and clothing.

A BUDGET LINE
A budget line describes the combinations of goods 
that can be purchased given the consumer’s income and the prices of the goods. Line AG (which passes 
through points B, D, and E) shows the budget as-
sociated with an income of $80, a price of food of P
F = $1 per unit, and a price of clothing of PC = $2 
per unit. The slope of the budget line (measured between points B and D) is − P
F/PC = −10/20 = −1/2.TABLE 3.2 MARKET BASKETS AND THE BUDGET LINE

D 40 20 $80
E 60 10 $80
G 80  0 $8084  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets 
Using equation (3.1), we can see how much of C must be given up to consume 
more of F. We divide both sides of the equation by PC and then solve for C:
 C=(I/PC)-(PF/PC)F (3.2)
Equation (3.2) is the equation for a straight line; it has a vertical intercept of 
I/PC and a slope of −( PF/PC).
The slope of the budget line, −( PF/PC), is the negative of the ratio of the prices of 
the two goods.  The magnitude of the slope tells us the rate at which the two goods 
can be substituted for each other without changing the total amount of money spent. The vertical intercept ( I/P
C) represents the maximum amount of C that 
can be purchased with income I. Finally, the horizontal intercept ( I/PF) tells us 
how many units of F can be purchased if all income were spent on F.
The Effects of Changes in Income and Prices
We have seen that the budget line depends both on income and on the prices 
of the goods, PF and PC. But of course prices and income often change. Let’s see 
how such changes affect the budget line.
INCOME CHANGES  What happens to the budget line when income changes? 
From the equation for the straight line (3.2), we can see that a change in income alters the vertical intercept of the budget line but does not change the slope (because the price of neither good changed). Figure 3.11 shows that if income is doubled (from $80 to $160), the budget line shifts outward, from budget line L
1 
to budget line L2. Note, however, that L2 remains parallel to L1. If she desires, our 
consumer can now double her purchases of both food and clothing. Likewise, if her income is cut in half (from $80 to $40), the budget line shifts inward, from L
1 to L3.
FIGURE 3.11
EFFECTS OF A CHANGE IN INCOME 
ON THE BUDGET LINE
A change in income (with prices unchanged) 
causes the budget line to shift parallel to the original line ( L
1). When the income of 
$80 (on L1) is increased to $160, the budget 
line shifts outward to L2. If the income falls 
to $40, the line shifts inward to L3.

PRICE CHANGES  What happens to the budget line if the price of one 
good changes but the price of the other does not? We can use the equation  C /H11005 (I/P
C) − (PF/PC)F to describe the effects of a change in the price of food on 
the budget line. Suppose the price of food falls by half, from $1 to $0.50. In that case, the vertical intercept of the budget line remains unchanged, although the slope changes from − P
F/PC /H11005 /H11002$1/$2 /H11005 /H11002$1/2 to /H11002$0.50/$2 /H11005 /H11002$1/4. In 
Figure 3.12, we obtain the new budget line L2 by rotating the original bud-
get line L1 outward, pivoting from the C-intercept. This rotation makes sense 
because a person who consumes only clothing and no food is unaffected by the price change. However, someone who consumes a large amount of food will experience an increase in his purchasing power. Because of the decline in the price of food, the maximum amount of food that can be purchased has doubled.
On the other hand, when the price of food doubles from $1 to $2, the budget 
line rotates inward to line L
3 because the person’s purchasing power has dimin-
ished. Again, a person who consumed only clothing would be unaffected by the food price increase.
What happens if the prices of both food and clothing change, but in a way 
that leaves the ratio  of the two prices unchanged? Because the slope of the bud-
get line is equal to the ratio of the two prices, the slope will remain the same. The intercept of the budget line must shift so that the new line is parallel to the old one. For example, if the prices of both goods fall by half, then the slope of the budget line does not change. However, both intercepts double, and the budget line is shifted outward.
This exercise tells us something about the determinants of a consumer’s 
 purchasing power —her ability to generate utility through the purchase of goods 
and services. Purchasing power is determined not only by income, but also by prices. For example, our consumer’s purchasing power can double either because her income doubles or because the prices of all the goods that she buys 
fall by half.
Finally, consider what happens if everything doubles—the prices of both 
food and clothing and the consumer’s income. (This can happen in an inflation-
ary economy.) Because both prices have doubled, the ratio of the prices has not changed; neither, therefore, has the slope of the budget line. Because the price of clothing has doubled along with income, the maximum amount of cloth-ing that can be purchased (represented by the vertical intercept of the budget

EFFECTS OF A CHANGE  
IN PRICE ON THE  BUDGET LINE
A change in the price of one good (with income 
unchanged) causes the budget line to rotate about one intercept. When the price of food falls from $1.00 to $0.50, the budget line rotates outward from L
1 to L2. However, when the price 
increases from $1.00 to $2.00, the line rotates  inward from L

line) is unchanged. The same is true for food. Therefore, inflationary conditions 
in which all prices and income levels rise proportionately will not affect the  consumer’s budget line or purchasing power.
3.3  Consumer Choice
Given preferences and budget constraints, we can now determine how individual consumers choose how much of each good to buy. We assume that consumers make this choice in a rational way—that they choose goods to maximize the sat-
isfaction they can achieve, given the limited budget available to them.  The maximizing 
market basket must satisfy two conditions:
 1. It must be located on the budget line. To see why, note that any market 
basket to the left of and below the budget line leaves some income unallo-cated—income which, if spent, could increase the consumer’s satisfaction. Of course, consumers can—and often do—save some of their incomes for future consumption. In that case, the choice is not just between food and clothing, but between consuming food or clothing now and consuming food or clothing in the future. At this point, however, we will keep things simple by assuming that all income is spent now. Note also that any market basket to the right of and above the budget line cannot be purchased with available income. Thus, the only rational and feasible choice is a basket on the budget line.
 2. It must give the consumer the most preferred combination of goods and 
services.  
These two conditions reduce the problem of maximizing consumer satisfaction 
to one of picking an appropriate point on the budget line.
In our food and clothing example, as with any two goods, we can graphically 
illustrate the solution to the consumer’s choice problem. Figure 3.13 shows how

MAXIMIZING CONSUMER  
SATISFACTION
A consumer maximizes satisfaction 
by choosing market basket A. At this 
point, the budget line and indiffer-ence curve U
2 are tangent, and no 
higher level of satisfaction (e.g., mar-ket basket D) can be attained. At A, 
the point of maximization, the MRS between the two goods equals the price ratio. At B, however, because 
the MRS [−(−10/10) = 1] is greater than the price ratio (1/2), satisfaction is not maximized.CHAPTER 3   •  Consumer Behavior  87
the problem is solved. Here, three indifference curves describe a consumer’s 
preferences for food and clothing. Remember that of the three curves, the outer-most curve, U
3, yields the greatest amount of satisfaction, curve U2 the next 
greatest amount, and curve U1 the least.
Note that point B on indifference curve U1 is not the most preferred choice, 
because a reallocation of income in which more is spent on food and less on clothing can increase the consumer’s satisfaction. In particular, by moving to point A, the consumer spends the same amount of money and achieves the 
increased level of satisfaction associated with indifference curve U
2. In addi-
tion, note that baskets located to the right and above indifference curve U2, like 
the basket associated with D on indifference curve U3, achieve a higher level of 
satisfaction but cannot be purchased with the available income. Therefore, A 
maximizes the consumer’s satisfaction.
We see from this analysis that the basket which maximizes satisfaction must lie 
on the highest indifference curve that touches the budget line. Point A is the point 
of tangency between indifference curve U2 and the budget line. At A, the slope of 
the budget line is exactly equal to the slope of the indifference curve. Because the MRS (− /H9004C//H9004F) is the negative of the slope of the indifference curve, we can say 
that satisfaction is maximized (given the budget constraint) at the point where
 MRS =P
F/PC (3.3)
This is an important result: Satisfaction is maximized when the marginal rate of 
substitution  (of F for C) is equal to the ratio of the prices  (of F to C). Thus the con-
sumer can obtain maximum satisfaction by adjusting his consumption of goods F and C so that the MRS equals the price ratio.
The condition given in equation (3.3) illustrates the kinds of optimization 
conditions that arise in economics. In this instance, satisfaction is maximized when the marginal benefit —the benefit associated with the consumption of one 
additional unit of food—is equal to the marginal cost —the cost of the additional 
unit of food. The marginal benefit is measured by the MRS. At point A, it equals 
1/2 (the magnitude of the slope of the indifference curve), which implies that the consumer is willing to give up 1/2 unit of clothing to obtain 1 unit of food. At the same point, the marginal cost is measured by the magnitude of the slope of the budget line; it too equals 1/2 because the cost of getting one unit of food is giving up 1/2 unit of clothing ( P
F /H11005 1 and PC /H11005 2 on the budget line).
If the MRS is less or greater than the price ratio, the consumer’s satisfaction 
has not been maximized. For example, compare point B in Figure 3.13 to point A. 
At point B, the consumer is purchasing 20 units of food and 30 units of clothing. 
The price ratio (or marginal cost) is equal to 1/2 because food costs $1 and cloth-ing $2. However, the MRS (or marginal benefit) is greater than 1/2; it is approxi-mately 1. As a result, the consumer is able to substitute 1 unit of food for 1 unit of clothing without loss of satisfaction. Because food is cheaper than clothing, it is in her interest to buy more food and less clothing. If our consumer purchases 1 less unit of clothing, for example, the $2 saved can be allocated to two units of food, even though only one unit is needed to maintain her level of satisfaction.
The reallocation of the budget continues in this manner (moving along the 
budget line), until we reach point A, where the price ratio of 1/2 just equals the 
MRS of 1/2. This point implies that our consumer is willing to trade one unit of clothing for two units of food. Only when the condition MRS /H11005 1/2 /H11005 P
F/PC 
holds is she maximizing her satisfaction.
The result that the MRS equals the price ratio is deceptively powerful. 
Imagine two consumers who have just purchased various quantities of food and • marginal benefit  Benefit 
from the consumption of one additional unit of a good.
• marginal cost  Cost of one 
additional unit of a good.88  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets 
clothing. If both are maximizing, you can tell the value of each person’s MRS 
by looking at the prices of the two goods. What you cannot tell, however, is the quantity of each good purchased, because that decision is determined by their individual preferences. If the two consumers have different tastes, they will consume different quantities of food and clothing, even though each MRS is the same.
EXAMPLE 3.3  DESIGNING NEW AUTOMOBILES (II)
Our analysis of consumer choice allows us to see how different preferences of consumer groups for automobiles can affect their purchasing decisions. Following up on Example 3.1 (page 77), we con-
sider two groups of consumers planning to buy new cars. Suppose that each consumer has an overall car budget of $20,000, but has decided to allo-cate $10,000 to interior size and acceleration and $10,000 to all the other attributes of a new car. Each group, however, has different preferences for size and acceleration.Figure 3.14 shows the car-buying budget con-
straint faced by individuals in each group. Those in the first group, who are typical of Ford Mustang coupe owners with preferences similar to those in Figure 3.7 (page 78), prefer acceleration to size. By finding the point of tangency between a typical individual’s indifference curve and the budget con-straint, we see that consumers in this group would prefer to buy a car whose acceleration was worth $7000 and whose size was worth $3000. Individuals in the second group, who are typical of Ford

CONSUMER CHOICE OF AUTOMOBILE ATTRIBUTES
The consumers in (a) are willing to trade off a considerable amount of interior space for some additional 
 acceleration. Given a budget constraint, they will choose a car that emphasizes acceleration. The opposite is 
true for consumers in (b).CHAPTER 3   •  Consumer Behavior  89
Corner Solutions
Sometimes consumers buy in extremes, at least within categories of goods. Some 
people, for example, spend no money on travel and entertainment. Indifference curve analysis can be used to show conditions under which consumers choose not to consume a particular good.
In Figure 3.15, a man faced with  budget line AB for snacks chooses to purchase 
only ice cream ( IC) and no frozen yogurt ( Y). This decision reflects what is called a 
corner solution.  When one of the goods is not consumed, the consumption bundle 
appears at the corner of the graph. At B, which is the point of maximum satisfaction, 
the MRS of ice cream for frozen yogurt is greater than the slope of the budget line. This inequality  suggests that if the consumer had more frozen yogurt to give up, he would gladly trade it for additional ice cream. At this point, however, our consumer is already consuming all ice cream and no frozen yogurt, and it is impossible to con-sume negative  amounts of frozen yogurt.
When a corner solution arises, the  consumer’s MRS does not necessarily equal the price 
ratio.  Unlike the condition expressed in equation (3.3), the necessary condition for 
satisfaction to be maximized when choosing between ice cream and frozen yogurt in a corner solution is given by the following inequality.

in which the marginal rate of substitution of one good for another in a chosen market basket is not equal to the  slope of the budget line.
7The first set of indifference curves for the Ford Mustang coupe will be of the following form: U (level 
of utility) /H11005 b0 (constant) /H11001 b1 *S (space in cubic feet) * b2*S2 /H11001 b3*H (horsepower) /H11001 b4*H2 /H11001 b5*O (a list 
of other attributes). Each indifference curve represents the combinations of S and H that generate the 
same level of utility. The comparable relationship for the Ford Explorer will have the same form, but different b’s.
8The survey design and the results are described in Steven Berry, James Levinsohn, and Ariel Pakes, 
“Differentiated Products Demand Systems from a Combination of Micro and Macro Data: The New Car Market,” Journal of Political Economy , 112 (February 2004): 68–105.
9Strict equality could hold if the slope of the budget constraint happened to equal the slope of the 
indifference curve—a condition that is unlikely.Explorer users, would prefer cars with $2500 worth 
of acceleration and $7500 worth of size.7
We have simplified matters for this example by 
considering only two attributes. In practice, an auto-mobile company will use marketing and statistical studies to learn how different groups of consum-ers value a broad set of attributes. Combined with information about how these attributes will affect manufacturing costs, the company can design a production and marketing plan.
In the context of our example, one potentially 
profitable option is to appeal to both groups of consumers by manufacturing a model emphasiz-ing acceleration to a slightly lesser degree than  preferred by those in Figure 3.14 (a). A second 
option is to produce a relatively large number of cars that emphasize size and a smaller number emphasizing acceleration.Knowledge about the preferences of each group 
(i.e., the actual indifference curves), along with infor-mation about the number of consumers in each, would help the firm make a sensible business deci-sion. In fact, an exercise similar to the one we’ve described here was carried out by General Motors in a survey of a large number of automobile buyers.
8 
Some of the results were expected. For example, households with children tended to prefer functional-ity over style and so tended to buy minivans rather than sedans and sporty cars. Rural households, on the other hand, tended to purchase pickups and all-wheel drives. More interesting was the strong corre-lation between age and attribute preferences. Older consumers tended to prefer larger and heavier cars with more safety features and accessories (e.g., power windows and steering). Further, younger consumers preferred greater horsepower and more stylish cars.90  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets 
This inequality would, of course, be reversed if the corner solution were at 
point A rather than B. In either case, we can see that the marginal benefit–mar-
ginal cost equality that we described in the previous section holds only when positive quantities of all goods are consumed.
An important lesson here is that predictions about how much of a prod-
uct consumers will purchase when faced with changing economic conditions depend on the nature of consumer preferences for that product and related products and on the slope of the consumer’s budget line. If the MRS of ice cream for frozen yogurt is substantially greater than the price ratio, as in Figure 3.15, then a small decrease in the price of frozen yogurt will not alter the consumer’s choice; he will still choose to consume only ice cream. But if the price of frozen yogurt falls far enough, the consumer could quickly choose to consume a lot of frozen yogurt.U1A

A CORNER SOLUTION
When the consumer’s marginal rate of sub-
stitution is not equal to the price ratio for all levels of consumption, a corner solution aris-es. The consumer maximizes satisfaction by consuming only one of the two goods. Given budget line AB, the highest level of satisfac-
tion is achieved at B on indifference curve U
1, 
where the MRS (of ice cream for frozen yo-gurt) is greater than the ratio of the price of ice cream to the price of frozen yogurt.
EXAMPLE 3.4  CONSUMER CHOICE OF HEALTH CARE
Expenditures on health care in the 
United States have risen dramati-cally over the past few decades, a phenomenon that some people find alarming. Some economists have argued that these expen-ditures have increased so much because our health care system is inefficient. That may well be, but there 
could also be another reason: As con-sumers become better off economi-cally, their preferences shift toward health care and away from other goods. After all, if you already own a nice home and two cars, what would give you more satisfaction—a third 
CHAPTER 3   •  Consumer Behavior  91
car, or additional  medical care that might extend 
your life by a year? Many would choose the extra health care.
The preferences for health care are illustrated in 
Figure 3.16, which shows a series of indifference curves and budget lines that characterize the trade-off between consumption of health care (H) versus other goods (O). Indifference curve U
1 applies to a 
consumer with low income; the consumer’s budget line is tangent at point A, so that the consumption of health care and consumption of other goods that maximize the consumer’s satisfaction are H
1 and 
O1. Indifference curve U2 yields a greater amount 
of satisfaction, but is only feasible for a consumer with higher income. In this case utility is maximized at point B. Curve U
3 applies to a high-income 
consumer, and implies less willingness to give up health care for other goods. Moving from point B to point C, the consumer’s consumption of health care increases considerably (from H
2 to H3), while her 
consumption of other goods increases only mod-estly (from O
2 to O3).
Does Figure 3.16 correctly characterize the 
preferences of consumers? At least one recent statistical study indicates that it does.
10 So does 
common sense. If your income were high enough so that you could have most of the things you wanted, would you prefer to spend additional income on life-extending health care or on another car?
10See the interesting article by Robert E. Hall and Charles I. Jones, “The Value of Life and the Rise in 
Health Spending,” Quarterly Journal of Economics , February 2007, pp. 39–72. The authors explain that 
the optimal composition of total spending shifts toward health as income increases. They predict that the optimal heath share of spending is likely to exceed 30 percent by 2050.U1U2U3Health

These indifference curves show the

3 applies to a

EXAMPLE 3.5  A COLLEGE TRUST FUND
Jane Doe’s parents have provided a trust fund for 
her college education. Jane, who is 18, can receive the entire trust fund on the condition that she spend it only on education. The fund is a welcome gift but perhaps not as welcome as an unrestricted trust. To see why Jane feels this way, consider Figure 3.17, in which dollars per year spent on education are shown on the horizontal axis and dollars spent on other forms of consumption on the vertical.
The budget line that Jane faces before being 
awarded the trust is given by line PQ. The trust fund 
expands the budget line outward as long as the full amount of the fund, shown by distance PB, is spent 
on education. By accepting the trust fund and going to college, Jane increases her satisfaction, moving from A on indifference curve U
1 to B on indifference 
curve U2.Note that B represents a corner solution because 
Jane’s marginal rate of substitution of education for other consumption is lower than the relative price of other consumption. Jane would prefer to spend a portion of the trust fund on other goods in addi-tion to education. Without restriction on the trust fund, she would move to C on indifference curve 
U
3, decreasing her spending on education (perhaps 
going to a junior college rather than a four-year col-lege) but increasing her spending on items that she enjoys more than education.
Recipients usually prefer unrestricted to restricted 
trusts. Restricted trusts are popular, however, because they allow parents to control children’s expenditures in ways that they believe are in the children’s long-run best interests.

3.4  Revealed Preference
In Section 3.1, we saw how an individual’s preferences could be represented by a 
series of indifference curves. Then in Section 3.3, we saw how preferences, given budget constraints, determine choices. Can this process be reversed? If we know the choices that a consumer has made, can we determine his or her preferences?CHAPTER 3   •  Consumer Behavior  93
We can if we have information about a sufficient number of choices that 
have been made when prices and income levels varied. The basic idea is simple. If a consumer chooses one market basket over another, and if the chosen 
market basket is more expensive than the alternative, then the consumer must pre-fer the chosen market basket.
Suppose that an individual, facing the budget constraint given by line l
1 
in Figure 3.18, chooses market basket A. Let’s compare A to baskets B and 
D. Because the individual could have purchased basket B (and all baskets 
below line l1) and did not, we say that A is preferred to B.
It might seem at first glance that we cannot make a direct comparison 
between baskets A and D because D is not on l1. But suppose the relative 
prices of food and clothing change, so that the new budget line is l2 and the 
individual then chooses market basket B. Because D lies on budget line l2 and 
was not chosen, B is preferred to D (and to all baskets below line l2). Because 
A is preferred to B and B is preferred to D, we conclude that A is preferred to 
D. Furthermore, note in Figure 3.18 that basket A is preferred to all of the bas-
kets that appear in the green-shaded areas. However, because food and cloth-ing are “goods” rather than “bads,” all baskets that lie in the pink-shaded area in the rectangle above and to the right of A are preferred to A. Thus, the 
indifference curve passing through A must lie in the unshaded area.
Given more information about choices when prices and income levels vary, we 
can get a better fix on the shape of the indifference curve. Consider Figure 3.18. Suppose that facing line l
3 (which was chosen to pass through A), the individ-
ual chooses market basket E. Because E was chosen even though A was equally 
expensive (it lies on the same budget line), E is preferred to A, as are all points in 
the rectangle above and to the right of E. Now suppose that facing line l4 (which 
passes through A), the individual chooses market basket G. Because G was cho-
sen and A was not, G is preferred to A, as are all market baskets above and to the 
right of G.
We can go further by making use of the assumption that indifference curves 
are convex. In that case, because E is preferred to A, all market baskets above 
and to the right of line AE in Figure 3.19 must be preferred to A. Otherwise, the 
indifference curve passing through A would have to pass through a point above

EXAMPLE 3.6  REVEALED PREFERENCE FOR RECREATION
A health club has been offering 
the use of its facilities to anyone who is willing to pay an hourly fee. Now the club decides to alter its pricing policy by charging both an annual membership fee and a lower hourly fee. Does this new financial arrangement make individuals better off or worse off than they were under the old arrangement? The answer depends on people’s preferences.
Suppose that Roberta has $100 of income avail-
able each week for recreational activities, includ-ing exercise, movies, restaurant meals, and so on. When the health club charged a fee of $4 per hour, Roberta used the facility 10 hours per week. Under the new arrangement, she is required to pay $30 per week but can use the club for only $1 per hour.Is this change beneficial for 
Roberta? Revealed preference analysis provides the answer. In Figure 3.20, line l
1 represents the 
budget constraint that Roberta faced under the original pricing arrangement. In this case, she maximized her satisfaction by choosing market basket A, with 
10 hours of exercise and $60 of other recreational activities. Under the new arrangement, which shifts the  budget line to l
2, she could still choose mar-
ket basket A. But because U1 is clearly not tangent 
to l2, Roberta will be better off choosing another 
basket, such as B, with 25 hours of exercise and 
$45 worth of other recreational activities. Because she would choose B when she could still choose A, 
she prefers B to A. The new pricing arrangement

which is revealed to be preferred to A (because

and to the right of AE and then fall below the line at E—in which case the indif-
ference curve would not be convex. By a similar argument, all points on AG or 
above are also preferred to A. Therefore, the indifference curve must lie within 
the unshaded area.
The revealed preference approach is valuable as a means of checking 
whether individual choices are consistent with the assumptions of consumer theory. As Example 3.6 shows, revealed preference analysis can help us understand the implications of choices that consumers must make in particu-lar  circumstances.CHAPTER 3   •  Consumer Behavior  95

3.5  Marginal Utility and Consumer Choice
In Section 3.3, we showed graphically how a consumer can maximize his or 
her satisfaction, given a budget constraint. We do this by finding the highest indifference curve that can be reached, given that budget constraint. Because the highest indifference curve also has the highest attainable level of utility, it is natural to recast the consumer’s problem as one of maximizing utility subject to a budget constraint.
The concept of utility can also be used to recast our analysis in a way that 
provides additional insight. To begin, let’s distinguish between the total  utility obtained by consumption and the satisfaction obtained from the last item  consumed. Marginal utility (MU)  measures the additional satisfaction obtained 
from consuming one additional unit of a good.  For example, the marginal utility 
associated with a consumption increase from 0 to 1 unit of food might be 9; from 1 to 2, it might be 7; from 2 to 3, it might be 5.
These numbers imply that the consumer has diminishing marginal  utility:  
As more and more of a good is consumed, consuming additional amounts will yield smaller and smaller additions to utility. Imagine, for example, the  consumption of television: Marginal utility might fall after the second or third hour and could become very small after the fourth or fifth hour of viewing.
We can relate the concept of marginal utility to the consumer’s 
 utility-maximization problem in the following way. Consider a small  movement • marginal utility (MU)
Additional satisfaction obtained 
from consuming one additional unit of a good.
• diminishing marginal utility
Principle that as more of a good 
is consumed, the consumption of additional amounts will yield smaller additions to utility. therefore makes Roberta better off. (Note that B is 
also preferred to C, which represents the option of 
not using the health club at all.)
We could also ask whether this new pricing 
system—called a two-part tariff —will increase the 
club’s profits. If all members are like Roberta and more use generates more profit, then the answer 
is yes. In general, however, the answer depends on two factors: the preferences of all members and the costs of operating the facility. We discuss the two-part tariff in detail in Chapter 11, where we study ways in which firms with market power set prices.96  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets 
down an indifference curve in Figure 3.8 (page 79). The additional consump-
tion of food, /H9004F, will generate marginal utility MUF. This shift results in a total 
increase in utility of MUF/H9004F. At the same time, the reduced consumption of 
clothing, /H9004C, will lower utility per unit by MUC, resulting in a total loss of 
MUC/H9004C.
Because all points on an indifference curve generate the same level of utility, 
the total gain in utility associated with the increase in F must balance the loss 
due to the lower consumption of C. Formally,
0=MU F(/H9004F)+MU C(/H9004C)
Now we can rearrange this equation so that
-(/H9004C//H9004F)=MU F/MU C
But because −( /H9004C//H9004F) is the MRS of F for C, it follows that
 MRS =MU F/MU C (3.5)
Equation (3.5) tells us that the MRS is the ratio of the marginal utility of F to 
the marginal utility of C. As the consumer gives up more and more of C to 
obtain more of F, the marginal utility of F falls and that of C increases, so MRS 
decreases.
We saw earlier in this chapter that when consumers maximize their satisfac-
tion, the MRS of F for C is equal to the ratio of the prices of the two goods:
 MRS =PF/PC (3.6)
Because the MRS is also equal to the ratio of the marginal utilities of consuming 
F and C (from equation 3.5), it follows that
MU F/MU C=PF/PC
or
 MU F/PF=MU C/PC (3.7)
Equation (3.7) is an important result. It tells us that utility maximization is 
achieved when the budget is allocated so that the marginal utility per dollar of 
expenditure is the same for each good.  To see why this principle must hold, sup-
pose that a person gets more utility from spending an additional dollar on food than on clothing. In this case, her utility will be increased by spending more on food. As long as the marginal utility of spending an extra dollar on food exceeds the marginal utility of spending an extra dollar on clothing, she can increase her utility by shifting her budget toward food and away from clothing. Eventually, the marginal utility of food will decrease (because there is diminishing marginal utility in its consumption) and the marginal utility of clothing will increase (for the same reason). Only when the consumer has sat-isfied the equal marginal principle —i.e., has equalized the marginal utility per 
dollar of expenditure across all goods —will she have maximized utility. The equal 
marginal principle is an important concept in microeconomics. It will reap-pear in different forms throughout our analysis of consumer and producer behavior.

EXAMPLE 3.7  MARGINAL UTILITY AND HAPPINESS
In Example 3.2 (page 81), we saw that 
money (i.e., a higher income) can buy happiness, at least to a degree. But what, if anything, does research on consumer satisfaction tell us about the relationship between happiness and the concepts of utility and marginal utility? Interestingly, that research is consistent with a pattern of diminishing marginal utility of income, both in the U.S. and across countries. To see why, let’s re-examine Figure 3.9 (page 82) in Example 3.2. The data sug-
gest that as incomes increase from one country to the next, satisfaction, happiness, or utility (we are using the three words interchangeably) all increase as per-capita income increases. The incremental  increase in satisfac-
tion, however, declines as income increases. If one is willing to accept that the satisfaction index resulting from the survey is a cardinal index, then 
the results are consistent with a diminish-ing marginal utility of income.
The results for the U.S. are qualitatively 
very similar to those for the 67 countries that make up the data for Figure 3.9. Figure 3.21 calculates the mean level of life satisfaction for nine separate income groups in the population; the lowest has a mean income of $6,250, the next a mean income of $16,250, and so on until the highest group, whose mean income 
is $87,500. The solid curve is the one that best fits the data. Once again, we can see that reported happi-ness increases with income, but at a diminishing rate. For those students concerned about future income prospects, a recent survey by psychologist Daniel Kahneman and economist Angus Deaton shows that

A comparison of mean levels of satisfaction with life across income classes in the United States shows that

Rationing
In times of war and other crises, governments sometimes ration food, gasoline, 
and other products, rather than allow prices to increase to competitive levels. During World War II, for example, individual households in the United States were limited to twelve ounces of sugar per week, one pound of coffee every five weeks, and three gallons of gasoline per week. Rationing has often been used with respect to water in periods of drought. Within the United States, California has often faced water rationing for both household consumption and agricul-tural production. Outside the United States, countries such as Rwanda, India, Pakistan, and Egypt have imposed water rationing as recently as 2010.
Nonprice rationing is an alternative that some consider more equitable than 
relying on uncontested market forces. Under a market system, those with higher incomes can outbid those with lower incomes to obtain goods that are in scarce supply. However, if products are rationed through a mechanism such as the allocation of coupons to households or  businesses, everyone will have an equal chance to purchase a rationed good.
To understand how we can analyze rationing using the basic consumer model, 
let’s use the gasoline rationing that occurred during 1979 as an example. Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, oil prices jumped, but the United States imposed price controls that prevented increases in the price of gasoline, resulting in short-ages. Gasoline was allocated by long lines at the gas pump: While those who were willing to give up their time waiting got the gas they wanted, others did not. By guaranteeing every eligible person a minimum amount of gasoline, rationing can provide some people with access to a product that they could not otherwise afford. But rationing hurts others by limiting the amount of gasoline that they can buy.
12
We can see this principle clearly in Figure 3.22, which applies to a woman 
with an annual income of $20,000. The horizontal axis shows her annual con-sumption of gasoline, the vertical axis her remaining income after purchasing 
12For a more extensive discussion of gasoline rationing, see H. E. Frech III and William C. Lee,

tional money does not improve a person’s ability to enjoy leisure time and good health—all of which fac-tor into one’s overall well-being.
11
These results offer strong support for the 
modern theory of economic decision making that underlies this text, but they are still being carefully scrutinized. For example, they do not account for the fact that satisfaction tends to vary with age, with younger people often expressing less satisfaction than older folks. Or we can look at this a different way. Students have something positive to look forward to as they get older and wiser.A second issue arises when we compare the results 
of happiness studies over time. Per-capita incomes in the U.S., U.K., Belgium, and Japan have all risen substantially over the past 20 years. Average happi-ness, however, has remained relatively unchanged. (Denmark, Germany, and Italy did show some increased satisfaction.) One  plausible interpretation 
is that happiness is a relative, not absolute, measure of well-being. As a country’s income increases over time, its citizens increase their expectations; in other words, they aspire to having higher incomes. To the extent that satisfaction is tied to whether those aspirations are met, satisfaction may not increase as income grows over time.

RATIONING
When a good is rationed, less is 
available than consumers would like to buy. Consumers may be worse off. Without gasoline  rationing, up 
to 20,000 gallons of  gasoline are 
available for consumption (at point B). The  consumer chooses point C

gasoline. Suppose the controlled gasoline price is $1 per gallon. Because her 
income is $20,000, she is limited to the points on budget line AB, which has a 
slope of −1. Point A represents her total income of $20,000. (If no gasoline were 
purchased, she would have $20,000 to spend on other goods.) At point B she 
would be spending her entire income on gasoline. At $1 per gallon, she might wish to buy 5000 gallons of gasoline per year and spend $15,000 on other goods, represented by C. At this point, she would have maximized her utility (by being 
on the highest possible indifference curve U
2), given her budget constraint of 
$20,000.
Let’s assume that with rationing, our consumer can purchase up to a maxi-
mum of 2000 gallons of gasoline. Thus, she now faces budget line ADE , which is 
not a straight line because purchases above 2000 gallons are not possible. Point D represents the point of consumption of 2000 gallons per year. At that point, 
the budget line become vertical, declining to point E, since rationing has lim-
ited gasoline consumption. The figure shows that her choice to consume at D 
involves a lower level of utility, U
1, than would be achieved without rationing, 
U2, because she is consuming less gasoline and more of other goods than she 
would otherwise prefer.
It is clear that at the rationed price the woman would be better off if her con-
sumption were not constrained. But is she better off under a rationing system than she would be if there were no rationing at all? The answer, not surprisingly, depends on what the competitive market price of gasoline would have been without rationing. Figure 3.23 illustrates this point. Recall that had the price of gasoline been determined by the market to be $1 per gallon, our consumer would have been able to buy up to 20,000 gallons of gasoline per year—hence the original budget line. With rationing, she chooses to buy the maximum allowable 2000 gallons per year, putting her on indifference curve U
1. Now suppose that 
the competitive market price had been $2.00 per gallon rather than $1.00. Now the relevant budget line would be the line that was associated with a maximum gasoline consumption of only 10,000 gallons per year, and with no rationing she 100  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets 
would choose point F, which lies below indifference curve U1. (At point F, she 
purchases 3,000 gallons of gasoline and has $14,000 to spend on other goods.)
But, consider what would happen if the price of gasoline were only $1.33 per 
gallon. Then the relevant budget line would be the line associated with a maxi-mum gasoline consumption of about 15,000 gallons per year ($20,000/$1.33). She would choose a point such as G, where she purchases more than 3,000 
galls of gasoline and has more than $14,000 to spend on other goods. In this case, she would be better off without rationing, since point G lies above indif-ference curve U
1. We can conclude, therefore, that while rationing is a less 
efficient means of allocating goods and serves, under any particular rationing scheme some individuals may well be better off, even though others will nec-essarily be worse off.
*3.6  Cost-of-Living Indexes
The Social Security system has been the subject of heated debate for some time now. Under the present system, a retired person receives an annual benefit that is initially determined at the time of retirement and is based on his or her work history. The benefit then increases from year to year at a rate equal to the rate of increase of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Does the CPI accu-rately reflect the cost of living for retirees? Is it appropriate to use the CPI as we now do—as a cost-of-living index  for other government programs, for 
private union pensions, and for private wage agreements? On a similar note, we might ask whether the Producer Price Index (PPI) accurately measures the change over time in the cost of production. The answers to these questions lie in the economic theory of consumer behavior. In this section, we describe the theoretical underpinnings of cost indexes such as the CPI, using an example that describes the hypothetical price changes that students and their parents might face.• cost-of-living index  Ratio

a measure of the cost of a “typical” consumer’s entire market basket. As such, changes in the CPI also mea-sure the rate of inflation.Spending

Ideal Cost-of-Living Index
Let’s look at two sisters, Rachel and Sarah, whose preferences are identical. When 
Sarah began her college education in 2000, her parents gave her a “discretion-ary” budget of $500 per quarter. Sarah could spend the money on food, which was available at a price of $2.00 per pound, and on books, which were avail-able at a price of $20 each. Sarah bought 100 pounds of food (at a cost of $200) and 15 books (at a cost of $300). Ten years later, in 2010, when Rachel (who had worked during the interim) is about to start college, her parents promise her a budget that is equivalent in buying power to the budget given to her older sister. Unfortunately, prices in the college town have increased, with food now $2.20 per pound and books $100 each. By how much should the discretionary budget be increased to make Rachel as well off in 2010 as her sister Sarah was in 2000? Table 3.3 summarizes the relevant data and Figure 3.24 provides the answer.
The initial budget constraint facing Sarah in 2000 is given by line l
1 in 
Figure 3.24; her utility-maximizing combination of food and books is at point A on indifference curve U
1. We can check that the cost of achieving this level of 
utility is $500, as stated in the table:
$500 =100  lbs.  of food *$2.00/lb. +15 books *$20/book
As Figure 3.24 shows, to achieve the same level of utility as Sarah while  facing the 
new higher prices, Rachel requires a budget sufficient to purchase the food-book TABLE 3.3 IDEAL COST-OF-LIVING INDEX

COST-OF-LIVING INDEXES
A price index, which represents the cost of

to the cost of bundle A at base-year prices, 
overstates the ideal cost-of-living index.102  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets 
consumption bundle given by point B on line l2 (and tangent to indifference curve 
U1), where she chooses 300 lbs. of food and 6 books. Note that in doing so, Rachel 
has taken into account the fact that the price of books has increased relative to food. Therefore, she has substituted toward food and away from books.
The cost to Rachel of attaining the same level of utility as Sarah is given by
$1260 =300
 lbs.  of food *$2.20/lb. +6 books *$100/book
The ideal cost-of-living adjustment  for Rachel is therefore $760 (which is $1260 
minus the $500 that was given to Sarah). The ideal cost-of-living index is
$1260/$500 =2.52
Our index needs a base year, which we will set at 2000 /H11005 100, so that the value of 
the index in 2010 is 252. A value of 252 implies a 152 percent increase in the cost of living, whereas a value of 100 would imply that the cost of living has not changed. This ideal cost-of-living index  represents the cost of attaining a given level of utility at 
current (2010) prices relative to the cost of attaining the same utility at base (2010) prices.
Laspeyres Index
Unfortunately, such an ideal cost-of-living index would entail large amounts of information. We would need to know individual preferences (which vary across the population) as well as prices and expenditures. Actual price indexes are there-fore based on consumer purchases , not preferences. A price index that uses a fixed 
consumption bundle in the base period  is called a Laspeyres price index. The Laspeyres 
price index  answers the question: What is the amount of money at current-year prices 
that an individual requires to purchase the bundle of goods and  services that was chosen in the base year divided by the cost of purchasing the same bundle at base-year prices?
The Laspeyres price index was illustrated in Figure 3.24. Calculating a 
Laspeyres cost-of-living index for Rachel is a straightforward process. Buying 100 pounds of food and 15 books in 2010 would require an expenditure of $1720 (100 *$2.20 +15*$100). This expenditure allows Rachel to choose 
bundle A on budget line l
3 (or any other bundle on that line). Line l3 was con-
structed by shifting line l2 outward until it intersected point A. Note that l3 is 
the budget line that allows Rachel to purchase, at current 2010 prices, the same consumption bundle that her sister purchased in 2000. To compensate Rachel for the increased cost of living, we must increase her discretionary budget by $1220. Using 100 as the base in 2000, the Laspeyres index is  therefore
100 *$1720/$500 =344
COMPARING IDEAL COST-OF-LIVING AND LASPEYRES INDEXES  In our 
example, the Laspeyres price index is clearly much higher than the ideal price index. Does a Laspeyres index always overstate the true cost-of-living index? The answer is yes, as you can see from Figure 3.24. Suppose that Rachel was given the budget associated with line l
3 during the base year of 2000. She could choose 
bundle A, but clearly she could achieve a higher level of utility if she purchased 
more food and fewer books (by moving to the right on line l3). Because A and B 
generate equal utility, it follows that Rachel is better off receiving a Laspeyres cost-of-living adjustment rather than an ideal adjustment. The Laspeyres index overcompensates Rachel for the higher cost of living, and the Laspeyres cost-of-living index is, therefore, greater than the ideal cost-of-living index.• ideal cost-of-living index

This result holds generally. Why? Because the Laspeyres price index assumes that 
consumers do not alter their consumption patterns as prices change.  By changing con-
sumption, however—increasing purchases of items that have become relatively cheaper and decreasing purchases of relatively more expensive items—consum-ers can achieve the same level of utility without having to consume the same bundle of goods that they did before the price change.
Paasche Index
Another commonly used cost-of-living index is the Paasche index.  Unlike the 
Laspeyres index, which focuses on the cost of buying a base-year bundle, the Paasche index focuses on the cost of buying the current year’s bundle.  In partic-
ular, the Paasche index answers another question: What is the amount of money 
at current-year prices that an individual requires to purchase the current bundle of goods and services divided by the cost of purchasing the same bundle in the base year?
COMPARING THE LASPEYRES AND PAASCHE INDEXES  It is helpful to 
compare the Laspeyres and the Paasche cost-of-living indexes.
• Laspeyres index:  The amount of money at current-year prices that an individ-
ual requires to purchase the bundle of goods and services that was chosen in the 
base year  divided by the cost of purchasing the same bundle at base-year prices.
• Paasche index:  The amount of money at current-year prices that an individ-
ual requires to purchase the bundle of goods and services chosen in the current 
year divided by the cost of purchasing the same bundle in the base year.
Both the Laspeyres (LI) and Paasche (PI) indexes are fixed-weight indexes:  
The quantities of the various goods and services in each index remain unchanged. For the Laspeyres index, however, the quantities remain unchanged at base-year  
levels; for the Paasche they remain unchanged at current-year  levels. Suppose 
generally that there are two goods, food ( F) and clothing ( C). Let:
P
Ft and PCt be current-year prices
PFb and PCb be base-year prices
Ft and Ct be current-year quantities
Fb and Cb be base-year quantities
We can write the two indexes as:
LI= PFtFb+PCtCb
PFbFb+PCbCb
PI= PFtFt+PCtCt
PFbFt+PCbCt
Just as the Laspeyres index will overstate the ideal cost of living, the Paasche 
will understate it because it assumes that the individual will buy the  current-year bundle in the base period. In actuality, facing base-year prices, consumers would have been able to achieve the same level of utility at a lower cost by changing their consumption bundles. Because the Paasche index is a ratio of the cost of • Paasche index  Amount of 
money at current-year prices that an individual requires to purchase a current bundle of goods and services divided by the cost of purchasing the same bundle in a base year.
• fixed-weight index
Cost-of-living index in which the 
quantities of goods and services remain unchanged.104  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets 
buying the current bundle divided by the cost of buying the current bundle at 
base-year prices, overstating the cost of the base-year bundle (the denominator in the ratio) will cause the Paasche index itself to be understated.
To illustrate the Laspeyres-Paasche comparison, let’s return to our earlier 
example and focus on Sarah’s choices of books and food. For Sarah (who went to college in 2000), the cost of buying the base-year bundle of books and food at current-year prices is $1720 (100
 lbs. *$2.20/lb. +15 books *$100/book). 
The cost of buying the same bundle at base-year prices is $500 
(100  lbs *$2/lb. +15 books *$20/book). The Laspeyres price index, LI, 
is therefore 100 *$1720/$500 =344, as reported previously. In contrast, 
the cost of buying the current-year bundle at current-year prices is $1260 
(300  lbs. *$2.20/lb. +6 books *$100/book). The cost of buying the same 
bundle at base-year prices is $720 (300  lbs *$2/lb. +6 books *$20/book). 
Consequently, the Paasche price index, PI, is 100 *$1260/$720 =175. As 
expected, the Paasche index is lower than the Laspeyres index and lower than the ideal index of 252.
Price Indexes in the United States: Chain Weighting
Historically, both the CPI and the PPI were measured as Laspeyres price indexes. The overall CPI was calculated each month by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics as the ratio of the cost of a typical bundle of consumer goods and services to the cost during a base period. A CPI for a particular category of goods and services (e.g., housing) would utilize a bundle of goods and services from that category. Similar calculations were done for the PPI using bundles of intermediate and wholesale goods.
We have seen that the Laspeyres index overstates the amount needed to 
compensate individuals for price increases. With respect to Social Security and other government programs, this means that using the CPI with base weights to adjust retirement benefits would tend to overcompensate most recipients and would thus require greater government expenditure.
While economists have known of this problem for years, it was not until the 
energy-price shocks of the 1970s, more recent fluctuations in food prices, and concerns surrounding federal deficits that dissatisfaction with the Laspeyres index grew. It was estimated, for example, that a failure to account for changes in computer-buying patterns in response to a sharp decrease in computer prices had caused the CPI to overstate the cost of living substantially.
For this reason, the U.S. government changed the construction of the CPI and 
the PPI, switching from a simple Laspeyres index to an index in which the base weights are updated every few years. A chain-weighted price index  is a cost-
of-living index that accounts for changes in quantities of goods and services over time. Chain weighting was not new to the U.S. It had been adopted in 1995 as an improvement to the GDP deflator, a Paasche price index used to deflate measures of gross domestic product (GDP) in order to obtain an estimate of real GDP (GDP adjusted for inflation).
13 Using chain-weighted versions of the CPI, 
PPI, and GDP deflator has reduced the biases associated with the use of simple Laspeyres and Paasche indexes, but because the weights are changed only infre-quently, the biases have not been eliminated.

14Failures to account adequately for the appearance of new goods and improvements in the quality

 1. The theory of consumer choice rests on the assumption 
that people behave rationally in an attempt to maxi-mize the satisfaction that they can obtain by purchas-ing a particular combination of goods and services.
 2. Consumer choice has two related parts: the study of 
the consumer’s preferences and the analysis of the budget line that constrains consumer choices. 3. Consumers make choices by comparing market bas-
kets or bundles of commodities. Preferences are assumed to be complete (consumers can compare all possible market baskets) and transitive (if they prefer basket A to B, and B to C, then they prefer A to C). In 
addition, economists assume that more of each good is always preferred to less.EXAMPLE 3.8  THE BIAS IN THE CPI
In the past decade, there has been growing public 
concern about the solvency of the Social Security system. At issue is the fact that retirement benefits are linked to the Consumer Price Index. Because the CPI was a Laspeyres index that could overstate the cost of living substantially, Congress has asked sev-eral economists to look into the matter.
A commission chaired by Stanford University pro-
fessor Michael Boskin concluded that the CPI over-stated inflation by approximately 1.1 percentage points—a significant amount given the relatively low rate of inflation in the United States in recent years.
15 
According to the commission, approximately 0.4 percentage points of the 1.1-percentage-point bias was due to the failure of the Laspeyres price index to account for changes in the current year mix of consumption of the products in the base-year  bundle. The remainder of the bias was due to the 
failure of the index to account for the growth of dis-count stores (approximately 0.1 percentage points), for improvements in the quality of existing products, and, most significantly, for the introduction of new products (0.6 percentage points).
The bias in the CPI was particularly acute when 
evaluating the costs of medical care. From 1986 to 1996, the average increase in the CPI was 3.6 percent, but the medical component of the CPI increased at an average annual rate of 6.5 percent 
per year. Thus, one estimate placed the total bias of the medical insurance part of the CPI at approxi-mately 3.1 percentage points annually. This bias has enormous policy implications as the nation struggles to contain medical-care costs and provide health care to an aging population.
16
If any remaining bias in the CPI were to be elimi-
nated, in whole or in part, the cost of a number of federal programs would decrease substantially (as would, of course, the corresponding benefits to eli-gible recipients in the programs). In addition to Social Security, affected programs would include federal retirement programs (for railroad employees and mili-tary veterans), Supplemental Security Income (income support for the poor), food stamps, and child nutri-tion. According to one study, a 1-percentage-point reduction in the CPI would increase national savings and thereby reduce the national debt by approxi-mately $95 billion per year in year 2000 dollars.
17
In addition, the effect of any CPI adjustments 
would not be restricted to the expenditure side of the federal budget. Because personal income tax brack-ets are inflation-adjusted, a CPI adjustment decreas-ing the rate of measured price increase would neces-sitate a smaller upper adjustment in tax brackets and, consequently, increase federal tax revenues.106  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets 
 4. Indifference curves, which represent all combinations 
of goods and services that give the same level of sat-isfaction, are downward-sloping and cannot intersect one another.
 5. Consumer preferences can be completely described by 
a set of indifference curves known as an indifference map. An indifference map provides an ordinal ranking of all choices that the consumer might make.
 6. The marginal rate of substitution (MRS) of F for C is 
the maximum amount of C that a person is willing 
to give up to obtain 1 additional unit of F. The MRS 
diminishes as we move down along an indifference curve. When there is a diminishing MRS, indifference curves are convex.
 7. Budget lines represent all combinations of goods for 
which consumers expend all their income. Budget lines shift outward in response to an increase in con-sumer income. When the price of one good (on the horizontal axis) changes while income and the price of the other good do not, budget lines pivot and rotate about a fixed point (on the vertical axis).
 8. Consumers maximize satisfaction subject to budget 
constraints. When a consumer maximizes satisfaction by consuming some of each of two goods, the marginal rate of substitution is equal to the ratio of the prices of the two goods being purchased.
 9. Maximization is sometimes achieved at a corner solu-
tion in which one good is not consumed. In such cases, the marginal rate of substitution need not equal the ratio of the prices.
 10. The theory of revealed preference shows how the 
choices that individuals make when prices and income vary can be used to determine their preferences. When an individual chooses basket A even though he or she 
could afford B, we know that A is preferred to B.
 11. The theory of the consumer can be presented by 
two different approaches. The indifference curve approach uses the ordinal properties of utility (that 
is, it allows for the ranking of alternatives). The util-
ity function approach obtains a utility function by attaching a number to each market basket; if basket A is preferred to basket B, A generates more utility 
than B.
 12. When risky choices are analyzed or when comparisons 
must be made among individuals, the cardinal proper-ties of the utility function can be important. Usually the utility function will show diminishing marginal utility: As more and more of a good is consumed, the consumer obtains smaller and smaller increments of utility.
 13. When the utility function approach is used and both 
goods are consumed, utility maximization occurs when the ratio of the marginal utilities of the two goods (which is the marginal rate of substitution) is equal to the ratio of the prices.
 14. In times of war and other crises, governments some-
times ration food, gasoline, and other products, rather than allow prices to increase to competitive levels. Some consider nonprice rationing to be more equitable than relying on uncontested market forces.
 15. An ideal cost-of-living index measures the cost of buy-
ing, at current prices, a bundle of goods that generates the same level of utility  as was provided by the bundle 
of goods consumed at base-year prices. The Laspeyres price index, however, represents the cost of buying the bundle of goods chosen in the base year at current prices relative to the cost of buying the same bundle  at 
base-year prices. The CPI, even with chain weighting, overstates the ideal cost-of-living index. By contrast, the Paasche index measures the cost at current-year prices of buying a bundle of goods chosen in the cur-rent year divided by the cost of buying the same bun-dle at base-year prices. It thus understates the ideal cost-of-living index.

Each index runs from 1 to 10, with 10 representing either the most styling or the best gas mileage. While looking at the list of cars, Brenda observes that on aver-age, as the style index increases by one unit, the price of the car increases by $5000.

F and clothing C is given by U(F,C) /H11005 FC. Suppose that 
Meredith’s income in 1990 is $1200 and that the prices of food and clothing are $1 per unit for each. By 2000, however, the price of food has increased to $2 and the price of clothing to $3. Let 100 represent the cost of living index for 1990. Calculate the ideal and the Laspeyres cost-of-living index for Meredith for 2000. (Hint:  Meredith will spend equal amounts on food and 
clothing with these preferences.)This page intentionally left blank  111Chapter 3 laid the foundation for the theory of consumer demand. 
We discussed the nature of consumer preferences and saw how, given budget constraints, consumers choose market baskets 
that maximize utility. From here it’s a short step to analyzing demand and showing how the demand for a good depends on its price, the prices of other goods, and income.
Our analysis of demand proceeds in six steps:
 1. We begin by deriving the demand curve for an individual con-
sumer. Because we know how changes in price and income affect a person’s budget line, we can determine how they affect con-sumption choice. We will use this information to see how the quantity of a good demanded varies in response to price changes as we move along an individual’s demand curve. We will also see how this demand curve shifts in response to changes in the individual’s income.
 2. With this foundation, we will examine the effect of a price change 
in more detail. When the price of a good goes up, individual demand for it can change in two ways. First, because it has now become more expensive relative to other goods, consumers will buy less of it and more of other goods. Second, the higher price reduces the consumer’s purchasing power. This reduction is just like a reduction in income and will lead to a reduction in con-sumer demand. By analyzing these two distinct effects, we will better understand the characteristics of demand.
 3. Next, we will see how individual demand curves can be aggre-
gated to determine the market demand curve. We will also study the characteristics of market demand and see why the demands for some kinds of goods differ considerably from the demands for others.
 4. We will go on to show how market demand curves can be used 
to measure the benefits that people receive when they consume products, above and beyond the expenditures they make. This information will be especially important later, when we study the effects of government intervention in a market.
 5. We then describe the effects of network externalities —i.e., what 
happens when a person’s demand for a good also depends on the 4.1

demands of other  people. These effects play a crucial role in the demands 
for many high-tech products, such as computer hardware and software, and telecommunications systems.
 6. Finally, we will briefly describe some of the methods that economists use 
to obtain empirical information about demand.
4.1  Individual Demand
This section shows how the demand curve of an individual consumer follows from the consumption choices that a person makes when faced with a  budget constraint. To illustrate these concepts graphically, we will limit the avail-able goods to food and clothing, and we will rely on the utility-maximization approach described in Section 3.3 (page 86).
Price Changes
We begin by examining ways in which the consumption of food and cloth-ing changes when the price of food changes. Figure 4.1 shows the consump-tion choices that a person will make when allocating a fixed amount of income between the two goods.
Initially, the price of food is $1, the price of clothing $2, and the consum-
er’s income $20. The utility-maximizing consumption choice is at point B in 
Figure 4.1 (a). Here, the consumer buys 12 units of food and 4 units of clothing, thus achieving the level of utility associated with indifference curve U
2.
Now look at Figure 4.1 (b), which shows the relationship between the price of 
food and the quantity demanded. The horizontal axis measures the quantity of food consumed, as in Figure 4.1 (a), but the vertical axis now measures the price of food. Point G in Figure 4.1 (b) corresponds to point B in Figure 4.1 (a). At G, 
the price of food is $1, and the consumer  purchases 12 units of food.
Suppose the price of food increases to $2. As we saw in Chapter 3, the budget 
line in Figure 4.1 (a) rotates inward about the vertical intercept, becoming twice as steep as before. The higher relative price of food has increased the magnitude of the slope of the budget line. The consumer now achieves maximum utility  at A, which is found on a lower indifference curve, U
1. Because the price of food 
has risen, the consumer’s purchasing power—and thus attainable utility—has fallen. At A, the consumer chooses 4 units of food and 6 units of clothing. In 
Figure 4.1 (b), this modified consumption choice is at E, which shows that at a 
price of $2, 4 units of food are demanded.
Finally, what will happen if the price of food decreases  to 50 cents? Because the 
budget line now rotates outward, the consumer can achieve the higher level of utility associated with indifference curve U
3 in Figure 4.1 (a) by selecting D, with 
20 units of food and 5 units of clothing. Point H in Figure 4.1 (b) shows the price 
of 50 cents and the quantity demanded of 20 units of food.
The Individual Demand Curve
We can go on to include all possible changes in the price of food. In Figure 4.1 (a),  
the price-consumption curve  traces the utility-maximizing combinations of 
food and clothing associated with every possible price of food. Note that as the price of food falls, attainable utility increases and the consumer buys more food. This pattern of increasing consumption of a good in response to a decrease in In §3.3, we explain how 
a consumer chooses the market basket on the high-est indifference curve that touches the consumer’s  budget line.
In §3.2, we explain how 
the budget line shifts in response to a price change.

price almost always holds. But what happens to the consumption of clothing 
as the price of food falls? As Figure 4.1 (a) shows, the consumption of clothing may either increase or decrease. The consumption of both food and clothing can 
increase because the decrease in the price of food has increased the consumer’s ability to purchase both goods.
An individual demand curve  relates the quantity of a good that a single 
consumer will buy to the price of that good. In Figure 4.1 (b), the individual demand curve relates the quantity of food that the consumer will buy to the price of food. This demand curve has two important properties:
1. The level of utility that can be attained changes as we move along the curve.  
The lower the price of the product, the higher the level of utility. Note from Figure 4.1 (a) that a higher indifference curve is reached as the price falls. Again, this result simply reflects the fact that as the price of a product falls, the consumer’s purchasing power increases.• individual demand

EFFECT OF PRICE CHANGES
A reduction in the price of food, with income and the 
price of clothing fixed, causes this consumer to choose a different market basket. In (a), the baskets that maxi-
mize utility for various prices of food (point A, $2; B, $1; 
D, $0.50) trace out the price-consumption curve. Part (b) 
gives the demand curve, which relates the price of food to the quantity demanded. (Points E, G , and H corre-
spond to points A, B, and D, respectively).114  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
2. At every point on the demand curve, the consumer is maximizing utility by 
satisfying the condition that the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) of food for clothing equals the ratio of the prices of food and clothing.  As the price of 
food falls, the price ratio and the MRS also fall. In Figure 4.1 (b), the price ratio falls from 1 ($2/$2) at E (because the curve U
1 is tangent to a budget line with 
a slope of  -1 at A) to 1/2 ($1/$2) at G, to 1/4 ($0.50/$2) at H. Because the con-
sumer is maximizing utility, the MRS of food for clothing decreases as we move down the demand curve. This phenomenon makes intuitive sense because it tells us that the relative value of food falls as the consumer buys more of it.
The fact that the MRS varies along the individual’s demand curve tells us 
something about how consumers value the consumption of a good or service. Suppose we were to ask a consumer how much she would be willing to pay for an additional unit of food when she is currently consuming 4 units. Point E on the demand curve in Figure 4.1 (b) provides the answer: $2. Why? As we 
pointed out above, because the MRS of food for clothing is 1 at E, one additional 
unit of food is worth one additional unit of clothing. But a unit of clothing costs $2, which is, therefore, the value (or marginal benefit) obtained by consuming an additional unit of food. Thus, as we move down the demand curve in Figure 4.1 (b), the MRS falls. Likewise, the value that the consumer places on an addi-tional unit of food falls from $2 to $1 to $0.50.
Income Changes
We have seen what happens to the consumption of food and clothing when the price of food changes. Now let’s see what happens when income changes.
The effects of a change in income can be analyzed in much the same way as a 
price change. Figure 4.2 (a) shows the consumption choices that a consumer will make when allocating a fixed income to food and clothing when the price of food is $1 and the price of clothing $2. As in Figure 4.1 (a), the quantity of clothing is measured on the vertical axis and the quantity of food on the horizontal axis. Income changes appear as changes in the budget line in Figure 4.2 (a). Initially, the consumer’s income is $10. The utility-maximizing consumption choice is then at A, at which point she buys 4 units of food and 3 units of clothing.
This choice of 4 units of food is also shown in Figure 4.2 (b) as E on demand 
curve D
1. Demand curve D1 is the curve that would be traced out if we held 
income fixed at $10 but varied the price of food.  Because we are holding the price 
of food constant, we will observe only a single point E on this demand curve.
What happens if the consumer’s income is increased to $20? Her budget line 
then shifts outward parallel to the original budget line, allowing her to attain the utility level associated with indifference curve U
2. Her optimal consump-
tion choice is now at B, where she buys 10 units of food and 5 units of clothing. 
In Figure 4.2 (b) her consumption of food is shown as G on demand curve D2. 
D2 is the demand curve that would be traced out if we held income fixed at $20 
but varied the price of food. Finally, note that if her income increases to $30, she chooses D, with a market basket containing 16 units of food (and 7 units of 
clothing), represented by H in Figure 4.2 (b).
We could go on to include all possible changes in income. In Figure 4.2 (a), 
the income-consumption curve  traces out the utility-maximizing combina-
tions of food and clothing associated with every income level. The income-consumption curve in Figure 4.2 slopes upward because the consump-tion of both food and clothing increases as income increases. Previously, we saw that a change in the price of a good corresponds to a movement along a 
demand curve.  Here, the situation is different. Because each demand curve is In §3.1, we introduce the 
marginal rate of substitution (MRS) as a measure of the maximum amount of one good that the consumer is willing to give up in order to obtain one unit of another good.

maximizing combinations of two goods as a consumer’s income changes.CHAPTER 4   •  Individual and Market Demand  115
 measured for a particular level of income, any change in income must lead 
to a shift in the demand curve itself.  Thus A on the income-consumption curve 
in Figure 4.2 (a) corresponds to E on demand curve D1 in Figure 4.2 (b); 
B corresponds to G on a different demand curve D2. The upward-sloping 
income-consumption curve implies that an increase in income causes a shift to the right in the demand curve—in this case from D
1 to D2 to D3.
Normal versus Inferior Goods
When the income-consumption curve has a positive slope, the quantity 
demanded increases with income. As a result, the income elasticity of demand is positive. The greater the shifts to the right of the demand curve, the larger the income elasticity. In this case, the goods are described as normal : Consumers 
want to buy more of them as their incomes increase.
In some cases, the quantity demanded falls as income increases; the income 
elasticity of demand is negative. We then describe the good as inferior.  The term 
inferior  simply means that consumption falls when income rises. Hamburger, for 
example, is inferior for some people: As their income increases, they buy less hamburger and more steak.In §2.4, we explain that the 
income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded resulting from a 1-percent increase in income.U1U2U3D

EFFECT OF INCOME CHANGES
An increase in income, with the prices of all goods fixed, causes 
consumers to alter their choice of market baskets. In part (a), the 
baskets that maximize  consumer satisfaction for various incomes 
(point A, $10; B, $20; D, $30) trace out the income-consumption 
curve. The shift to the right of the demand curve in response to 
the increases in in come is shown in part (b). (Points E, G, and H 
correspond to points A, B, and D, respectively.)116  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
Figure 4.3 shows the income-consumption curve for an inferior good. For 
relatively low levels of income, both hamburger and steak are normal goods. As income rises, however, the income-consumption curve bends backward (from point B to C). This shift occurs because hamburger has become an inferior 
good—its consumption has fallen as income has increased.
Engel Curves
Income-consumption curves can be used to construct Engel curves,  which relate 
the quantity of a good consumed to an individual’s income. Figure 4.4 shows how such curves are constructed for two different goods. Figure 4.4 (a), which shows • Engel curve  Curve

EXAMPLE 4.1  CONSUMER EXPENDITURES IN THE UNITED STATES
The Engel curves we just exam-
ined apply to individual consum-ers. However, we can also derive Engel curves for groups of con-sumers. This information is particu-larly useful if we want to see how consumer spending varies among different income groups. Table 4.1 illustrates spending patterns for several items taken from a survey by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Although the data are averaged over many households, they can be interpreted as describing the expenditures of a 
typical family.
Note that the data relate expen-
ditures  on a particular item rather 
than the quantity  of the item to 
income. The first two items, enter-tainment and owned dwellings, are consumption goods for which the income elasticity of demand is 
high. Average family expenditures on entertainment increase almost fivefold when we move from the lowest to highest income group. The same  pattern 
an upward-sloping Engel curve, is derived directly from Figure 4.2 (a). In both 
figures, as the individual’s income increases from $10 to $20 to $30, her consump-tion of food increases from 4 to 10 to 16 units. Recall that in Figure 4.2 (a) the verti-cal axis measured units of clothing consumed per month and the horizontal axis units of food per month; changes in income were reflected as shifts in the budget line. In Figures 4.4 (a) and (b), we have replotted the data to put income on the vertical axis, while keeping food and hamburger on the horizontal.
The upward-sloping Engel curve in Figure 4.4 (a)—like the upward-sloping 
income-consumption curve in Figure 4.2 (a)—applies to all normal goods. Note that an Engel curve for clothing would have a similar shape (clothing consump-tion increases from 3 to 5 to 7 units as income increases).
Figure 4.4 (b), derived from Figure 4.3, shows the Engel curve for hamburger. 
We see that hamburger consumption increases from 5 to 10 units as income increases from $10 to $20. As income increases further, from $20 to $30, con-sumption falls to 8 units. The portion of the Engel curve that slopes downward is the income range within which hamburger is an inferior good.

Substitutes and Complements
The demand curves that we graphed in Chapter 2 showed the relationship 
between the price of a good and the quantity demanded, with preferences, income, and the prices of all other goods held constant. For many goods, demand is related to the consumption and prices of other goods. Baseball bats and baseballs, hot dogs and mustard, and computer hardware and software are all examples of goods that tend to be used together. Other goods, such as cola and diet cola, owner-occupied houses and rental apartments, movie tickets and videocassette rentals, tend to substitute for one another.
Recall from Section 2.1 (page 22) that two goods are substitutes  if an increase 
in the price of one leads to an increase in the quantity demanded of the other. applies to the purchase of homes: There is a more than a sixfold increase in expenditures from the low-est to the highest category.
In contrast, expenditures on rental  housing actu-
ally fall as income rises. This pattern reflects the 
fact that most higher-income individuals own rather than rent homes. Thus rental housing is an inferior good, at least for incomes above $30,000 per year. Finally, note that health care, food, and clothing are consumption items for which the income elasticities are positive, but not as high as for entertainment or 
owner-occupied housing.
The data in Table 4.1 for rented dwellings, 
health care, and entertainment have been plotted in Figure 4.5. Observe in the three Engel curves that as income rises, expenditures on entertain-ment and health care increase rapidly, while expenditures on rental housing increase when income is low, but decrease once income exceeds $30,000.

If the price of a movie ticket rises, we would expect individuals to rent more 
videos, because movie tickets and videos are substitutes. Similarly, two goods are complements  if an increase in the price of one good leads to a decrease in 
the quantity demanded of the other. If the price of gasoline goes up, causing gasoline consumption to fall, we would expect the consumption of motor oil to fall as well, because gasoline and motor oil are used together. Two goods are independent  if a change in the price of one good has no effect on the quantity 
demanded of the other.
One way to see whether two goods are complements or substitutes is to 
examine the price-consumption curve. Look again at Figure 4.1 (page 113). Note that in the downward-sloping portion of the price-consumption curve, food and clothing are substitutes: The lower price of food leads to a lower consumption of clothing (perhaps because as food expenditures increase, less income is avail-able to spend on clothing). Similarly, food and clothing are complements in the upward-sloping portion of the curve: The lower price of food leads to higher clothing consumption (perhaps because the consumer eats more meals at res-taurants and must be suitably dressed).
The fact that goods can be complements or substitutes suggests that when 
studying the effects of price changes in one market, it may be important to look at the consequences in related markets. (Interrelationships among markets are discussed in more detail in Chapter 16.) Determining whether two goods are complements, substitutes, or independent goods is ultimately an empirical question. To answer the question, we need to look at the ways in which the demand for the first good shifts (if at all) in response to a change in the price of the second. This question is more difficult than it sounds because lots of things are likely to be changing at the same time that the price of the first good changes. In fact, Section 4.6 of this chapter is devoted to examining ways to distinguish empirically among the many possible explanations for a change in the demand for the second good. First, however, it will be useful to undertake a basic theo-retical exercise. In the next section, we delve into the ways in which a change in the price of a good can affect consumer demand.
4.2  Income and Substitution Effects
A fall in the price of a good has two effects:
 1. Consumers will tend to buy more of the good that has become cheaper 
and less of those goods that are now relatively more expensive . This 
response to a change in the relative prices of goods is called the substitu-
tion effect.
 2. Because one of the goods is now cheaper, consumers enjoy an increase in 
real purchasing power . They are better off because they can buy the same 
amount of the good for less money, and thus have money left over for  
additional purchases. The change in demand resulting from this change in real purchasing power is called the income effect.
Normally, these two effects occur simultaneously, but it will be useful to 
distinguish between them for purposes of analysis. The specifics are illustrated in Figure 4.6, where the initial budget line is RS and there are two goods, food 
and clothing. Here, the consumer maximizes utility by choosing the market basket at A, thereby obtaining the level of utility associated with the indiffer-
ence curve U
1.120  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
Now let’s see what happens if the price of food falls, causing the budget line 
to rotate outward to line RT. The consumer now chooses the market basket at 
B on indifference curve U2. Because market basket B was chosen even though 
market basket A was feasible, we know (from our discussion of revealed prefer-
ence in Section 3.4) that B is preferred to A. Thus, the reduction in the price of 
food allows the consumer to increase her level of satisfaction—her purchasing power has increased. The total change in the consumption of food caused by the lower price is given by F
1F2. Initially, the consumer purchased OF1 units of food, 
but after the price change, food consumption has increased to OF2. Line segment 
F1F2, therefore, represents the increase in desired food purchases.
Substitution Effect
The drop in price has both a substitution effect and an income effect. The  substitution effect  is the change in food consumption associated with a change in the 
price of food, with the level of utility held constant.  The substitution effect captures 
the change in food consumption that occurs as a result of the price change that makes food relatively cheaper than clothing. This substitution is marked by a movement along an indifference curve. In Figure 4.6, the substitution effect can be obtained by drawing a budget line which is parallel to the new budget line RT (reflecting the lower relative price of food), but which is just tangent to the 
original indifference curve U
1 (holding the level of satisfaction constant). The 
new, lower imaginary budget line reflects the fact that nominal income was reduced in order to accomplish our conceptual goal of isolating the substitu-tion effect. Given that budget line, the consumer chooses market basket D and 
consumes OE units of food. The line segment F
1E thus represents the substitu-
tion effect.
Figure 4.6 makes it clear that when the price of food declines, the substitution 
effect always leads to an increase in the quantity of food demanded. The expla-nation lies in the fourth assumption about consumer preferences discussed in In §3.4, we show how infor-
mation about consumer preferences is revealed by consumption choices made.

INCOME AND SUBSTITUTION  
EFFECTS: NORMAL GOOD
A decrease in the price of food has both an in-
come effect and a substitution effect. The con-sumer is initially at A, on budget line RS. When 
the price of food falls, consumption increases by F
1F2 as the consumer moves to B. The substi-
tution effect F1E (associated with a move from 
A to D) changes the relative prices of food and 
clothing but keeps real income (satisfaction) constant. The income effect EF
2 (associated 
with a move from D to B) keeps relative prices 
constant but increases purchasing power. Food is a normal good because the income effect EF
2 
is positive.CHAPTER 4   •  Individual and Market Demand  121
Section 3.1—namely, that indifference curves are convex. Thus, with the convex 
indifference curves shown in the figure, the point that maximizes satisfaction on the new imaginary budget line parallel to RT must lie below and to the right of 
the original point of tangency.
Income Effect
Now let’s consider the income effect:  the change in food consumption brought 
about by the increase in purchasing power, with relative prices held constant.  In 
Figure 4.6, we can see the income effect by moving from the imaginary budget line that passes through point D to the parallel budget line, RT, which passes 
through B. The consumer chooses market basket B on indifference curve U
2 
(because the lower price of food has increased her level of utility). The increase in food consumption from OE to OF
2 is the measure of the income effect, which 
is positive, because food is a normal good  (consumers will buy more of it as their 
incomes increase). Because it reflects a movement from one indifference curve to another, the income effect measures the change in the consumer’s purchas-ing power.
We have seen in Figure 4.6 that the total effect of a change in price is given 
theoretically by the sum of the substitution effect and the income effect:
Total Effect
 (F1F2)=Substitution Effect  (F1E)+Income Effect  (EF2)
Recall that the direction of the substitution effect is always the same: A decline 
in price leads to an increase in consumption of the good. However, the income effect can move demand in either direction, depending on whether the good is normal or inferior.
A good is inferior  when the income effect is negative: As income rises, con-
sumption falls. Figure 4.7 shows income and substitution effects for an inferior good. The negative income effect is measured by line segment EF

The consumer is initially at A on budget line RS. 
With a decrease in the price of food, the con-sumer moves to B. The resulting change in food 
purchased can be broken down into a substitu-tion effect, F
1E (associated with a move from A 
to D), and an income effect, EF2 (associated with 
a move from D to B). In this case, food is an infe-
rior good because the income effect is negative. However, because the substitution effect exceeds the income effect, the decrease in the price of food leads to an increase in the quantity of food demanded.122  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets

UPWARD-SLOPING DEMAND  
CURVE: THE GIFFEN GOOD
When food is an inferior good, and when the 
income effect is large enough to dominate the substitution effect, the demand curve will be upward-sloping. The consumer is ini-tially at point A, but, after the price of food 
falls, moves to B and consumes less food. 
Because the income effect EF

the substitution effect F1E, the decrease in

inferior goods, the income effect is rarely large enough to outweigh the substitu-
tion effect. As a result, when the price of an inferior good falls, its consumption almost always increases.
A Special Case: The Giffen Good
Theoretically, the income effect may be large enough to cause the demand curve for a good to slope upward. We call such a good a Giffen good,  and Figure 4.8 
shows its income and substitution effects. Initially, the consumer is at A, consuming 
relatively little clothing and much food. Now the price of food declines. The decline in the price of food frees enough income so that the consumer desires to buy more clothing and fewer units of food, as illustrated by B. Revealed preference tells us 
that the consumer is better off at B rather than A even though less food is consumed.
Though intriguing, the Giffen good is rarely of practical interest because it 
requires a large negative income effect. But the income effect is usually small: Individually, most goods account for only a small part of a consumer’s budget. Large income effects are often associated with normal rather than inferior goods (e.g., total spending on food or housing).• Giffen good  Good

EXAMPLE 4.2  THE EFFECTS OF A GASOLINE TAX
In part to conserve energy and in part to raise rev-
enues, the U.S. government has often considered increasing the federal gasoline tax. In 1993, for example, a modest 4.3 cent increase was enacted as part of a larger budget-reform package. This increase was much less than the increase that would have been necessary to put U.S. gasoline prices on a par with those in Europe. Because an important goal of higher gasoline taxes is to dis-
courage gasoline consumption, the government has also considered ways of passing the resulting income back to consumers. One popular sugges-tion is a rebate program in which tax revenues would be returned to households on an equal per-capita basis. What would be the effect of such a program?CHAPTER 4   •  Individual and Market Demand  123
Let’s begin by focusing on the effect of the 
program over a period of five years. The relevant price elasticity of demand is about -0.5.
1 Suppose 
that a low-income consumer uses about 1200 gal-lons of gasoline per year, that gasoline costs $1 per gallon, and that our consumer’s annual income is $9000.
Figure 4.9 shows the effect of the gasoline tax. 
(The graph has intentionally been drawn not to scale so that the effects we are discussing can be seen more clearly.) The original budget line is AB, and the 
consumer maximizes utility (on indifference curve U
2) 
by consuming the market basket at C,  buying 1200 gallons of gasoline and spending $7800 on other 
goods. If the tax is 50 cents per gallon, price will increase by 50 percent, shifting the new budget line to AD.
2 (Recall that when price changes and income 
stays fixed, the budget line rotates around a pivot point on the unchanged axis.) With a price elasticity of -0.5, consumption will decline 25 percent, from 
1200 to 900 gallons, as shown by the utility-maxi-mizing point E on indifference curve U
1 (for every

EFFECT OF A GASOLINE TAX WITH A REBATE
A gasoline tax is imposed when the consumer is initially buying 1200 gallons of gasoline at 
point C. After the tax takes effect, the budget line shifts from AB to AD and the consum-
er maximizes his preferences by choosing E, with a gasoline consumption of 900 gallons. 
However, when the proceeds of the tax are rebated to the consumer, his consumption  
increases somewhat, to 913.5 gallons at H. Despite the rebate program, the consumer’s 
gasoline consumption has fallen, as has his level of satisfaction.
1We saw in Chapter 2 that the price elasticity of demand for gasoline varies substantially from the 
short run to the long run.
2To simplify the example, we have assumed that the entire tax is paid by consumers in the form of a 
higher price. A broader analysis of tax shifting is presented in Chapter 9.124  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
4.3  Market Demand
So far, we have discussed the demand curve for an individual consumer. Now 
we turn to the market demand curve. Recall from Chapter 2 that a market demand curve shows how much of a good consumers overall are willing to buy as its price changes. In this section, we show how market demand curves  can 
be derived as the sum of the individual demand curves of all consumers in a particular market.
From Individual to Market Demand
To keep things simple, let’s assume that only three consumers ( A, B, and C) are 
in the market for coffee. Table 4.2 tabulates several points on each consumer’s demand curve. The market demand, column (5), is found by adding columns (2), (3), and (4), representing our three consumers, to determine the total quan-tity demanded at every price. When the price is $3, for example, the total quan-tity demanded is 2 +6+10, or 18.
Figure 4.10 shows these same three consumers’ demand curves for coffee 
(labeled D
A, DB, and DC). In the graph, the market demand curve is the horizon-
tal summation  of the demands of each consumer. We sum horizontally to find 
the total amount that the three consumers will demand at any given price. For • market demand curve  
Curve relating the quantity of a good that all consumers in a market will buy to its price.per person is about $450 (900 gallons times 50 cents 
per gallon), each consumer receives a $450 rebate. How does this increased income affect gasoline consumption? The effect can be shown graphically by shifting the budget line upward by $450, to line FJ, which is parallel to AD. How much gasoline 
does our consumer buy now? In Chapter 2, we saw that the income elasticity of demand for gasoline is approximately 0.3. Because $450 represents a 5-percent increase in income ( $450/$9000 =0.05),
we would expect the rebate to increase consump-tion by 1.5 percent (0.3 times 5 percent) of 900 gallons, or 13.5 gallons. The new utility-maximizing consumption choice at H reflects this expectation. 
(We omitted the indifference curve that is tangent at H to simplify the diagram.) With the rebate pro-
gram, the tax would reduce gasoline consumption by 286.5 gallons, from 1200 to 913.5. Because the income elasticity of demand for gasoline is relatively low, the income effect of the rebate pro-gram is dominated by the substitution effect, and the program with a rebate does indeed reduce  
consumption.
In order to put a real tax-rebate program into 
effect, Congress would have to solve a variety of practical problems. First, incoming tax receipts and rebate expenditures would vary from year to year, making it difficult to plan the budgeting process. 
For example, the tax rebate of $450 in the first year of the program is an increase in income. During the second year, it would lead to some increase in  
gasoline consumption among the low-income  
consumers that we are studying. With increased consumption, however, the tax paid and the rebate received by an individual will increase in the second year. As a result, it may be difficult to predict the size of the program budget.
Figure 4.9 reveals that the gasoline tax program 
makes this particular low-income consumer slightly worse off because H lies just below indifference 
curve U
2. Of course, some low-income consum-
ers might actually benefit from the program (if, for example, they consume less gasoline on average than the group of consumers whose consumption determines the selected rebate). Nevertheless, the substitution effect caused by the tax will make con-sumers, on average, worse off.
Why, then, introduce such a program? Those 
who support gasoline taxes argue that they  
promote national security (by reducing dependence on foreign oil) and encourage conservation, thus help-ing to slow global warming by reducing the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. We will further examine the impact of a gasoline tax in Chapter 9.CHAPTER 4   •  Individual and Market Demand  125

example, when the price is $4, the quantity demanded by the market (11 units) 
is the sum of the quantity demanded by A (no units), by B (4 units), and by C 
(7 units). Because all of the individual demand curves slope downward, the market demand curve will also slope downward. However, even though each of the individual demand curves is a straight line, the market demand curve need not be. In Figure 4.10, for example, the market demand curve is kinked  
because one consumer makes no purchases at prices that the other consumers find acceptable (those above $4).

SUMMING TO OBTAIN A MARKET DEMAND CURVE
The market demand curve is obtained by summing our three consumers’ demand curves 
DA, DB, and DC. At each price, the quantity of coffee demanded by the market is the sum 
of the quantities demanded by each consumer. At a price of $4, for example, the quantity demanded by the market (11 units) is the sum of the quantity demanded by A (no units), B 
(4 units), and C (7 units).126  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
Two points should be noted as a result of this analysis:
 1. The market demand curve will shift to the right as more consumers enter 
the market.   
 2. Factors that influence the demands of many consumers will also affect 
market demand.  Suppose, for example, that most consumers in a particular 
market earn more income and, as a result, increase their demands for cof-fee. Because each consumer’s demand curve shifts to the right, so will the market demand curve.
The aggregation of individual demands into market demands is not just a 
theoretical exercise. It becomes important in practice when market demands are built up from the demands of different demographic groups or from consumers located in different areas. For example, we might obtain information about the demand for home computers by adding independently obtained information about the demands of the following groups:
• Households with children
• Households without children
• Single individuals
Or, we might determine U.S. wheat demand by aggregating domestic demand 
(i.e., by U.S. consumers) and export demand (i.e., by foreign consumers), as we will see in Example 4.3.
Elasticity of Demand
Recall from Section 2.4 (page 33) that the price elasticity of demand measures the percentage change in the quantity demanded resulting from a 1-percent increase in price. Denoting the quantity of a good by Q and its price by P, the 
price elasticity of demand  is
 E
P=/H9004Q/Q
/H9004P/P=aP
Qba/H9004Q
/H9004Pb (4.1)
(Here, because /H9004 means “a change in,” /H9004Q/Q is the percentage change in Q.)
INELASTIC DEMAND  When demand is inelastic (i.e., EP is less than 1 in abso-
lute value), the quantity demanded is relatively unresponsive to changes in price. As a result, total expenditure on the product increases when the price increases. Suppose, for example, that a family currently uses 1000 gallons of gasoline a year when the price is $1 per gallon; suppose also that our fam-ily’s price elasticity of demand for gasoline is -0.5. If the price of gasoline 
increases to $1.10 (a 10-percent increase), the consumption of gasoline falls to 950 gallons (a 5-percent decrease). Total expenditure on gasoline, however, will increase from $1000 (1000 gallons
*$1 per gallon) to $1045 (950 gallons
*$1.10 per gallon).
ELASTIC DEMAND  In contrast, when demand is elastic ( EP is greater than 1 in abso-
lute value), total expenditure on the product decreases as the price goes up. Suppose that a family buys 100 pounds of chicken per year at a price of $2 per pound; the price elasticity of demand for chicken is -1.5. If the price of chicken increases to 
$2.20 (a 10-percent increase), our family’s consumption of chicken falls to 85 pounds In §2.4, we show how the 
price elasticity of demand describes the responsiveness of consumer demands to changes in price.
Recall from §2.4 that because the magnitude of an elasticity refers to its absolute value, an elasticity of −0.5 is less in magnitude than a −1.0 elasticity.CHAPTER 4   •  Individual and Market Demand  127
a year (a 15-percent decrease). Total expenditure on chicken will also fall, from $200 
(100 pounds *$2 per pound) to $187 (85 pounds *$2.20 per pound).
ISOELASTIC DEMAND  When the price elasticity of demand is constant all 
along the demand curve, we say that the curve is isoelastic.  Figure 4.11 shows 
an isoelastic demand curve. Note how this demand curve is bowed inward. In contrast, recall from Section 2.4 what happens to the price elasticity of demand as we move along a linear demand curve.  Although the slope of the linear curve is 
constant, the price elasticity of demand is not. It is zero when the price is zero, and it increases in magnitude until it becomes infinite when the price is suffi-ciently high for the quantity demanded to become zero.
A special case of the isoelastic curve is the unit-elastic demand curve:  a demand 
curve with price elasticity always equal to  - 1, as is the case for the curve in 
Figure 4.11. In this case, total expenditure remains the same after a price change. A price increase, for instance, leads to a decrease in the quantity demanded that leaves the total expenditure on the good unchanged. Suppose, for example, that the total expenditure on first-run movies in Berkeley, California, is $5.4 million per year, regardless of the price of a movie ticket. For all points along the demand curve, the price times the quantity will be $5.4 million. If the price is $6, the  
quantity will be 900,000 tickets; if the price increases to $9, the quantity will drop to 600,000 tickets, as shown in Figure 4.11.
Table 4.3 summarizes the relationship between elasticity and expenditure. It 
is useful to review this table from the perspective of the seller of the good rather • isoelastic demand curve

In §2.4, we show that when the demand curve is linear, demand becomes more elastic as the price of the product increases.9

than the buyer. (What the seller perceives as total revenue, the consumer views 
as total expenditures.) When demand is inelastic, a price increase leads only to a small decrease in quantity demanded; thus, the seller’s total revenue increases. But when demand is elastic, a price increase leads to a large decline in quantity demanded and total revenue falls.
EXAMPLE 4.3  THE AGGREGATE DEMAND FOR WHEAT
In Chapter 2 (Example 2.5—page 37), we explained that the demand for U.S. wheat has two components: domestic demand (by U.S. consum-ers) and export demand (by foreign consumers). Let’s see how the total demand for wheat can be obtained by aggregating the domestic and for-eign demands.
Domestic demand for wheat is given by the equation
Q
DD=1430 -55P
where QDD is the number of bushels (in millions) demanded domestically, and 
P is the price in dollars per bushel. Export demand is given by
QDE=1470 -70P
where QDE is the number of bushels (in millions) demanded from abroad. As 
shown in Figure 4.12, domestic demand, given by AB, is relatively price inelas-
tic. (Statistical studies have shown that price elasticity of domestic demand is about −0.2 to −0.3.) However, export demand, given by CD, is more price elas-
tic, with an elasticity of about −0.4. Why? Export demand is more elastic than

THE AGGREGATE  
DEMAND FOR WHEAT
The total world demand 
for wheat is the horizontal sum of the domestic de-mand AB and the export 
demand CD. Even though 
each individual demand curve is linear, the market demand curve is kinked, reflecting the fact that there is no export demand when the price of wheat is greater than about $21 per bushel.CHAPTER 4   •  Individual and Market Demand  129
3For a survey of statistical studies of demand and supply elasticities and an analysis of the U.S. 
wheat market, see Larry Salathe and Sudchada Langley, “An Empirical Analysis of Alternative Export Subsidy Programs for U.S. Wheat,” Agricultural Economics Research  38, No. 1 (Winter 1986).domestic demand because poorer countries that import U.S. wheat turn to 
other grains and foodstuffs if wheat prices rise.3
To obtain the world demand for wheat, we set the left side of each demand 
equation equal to the quantity of wheat (the variable on the horizontal axis). We then add the right side of the equations, obtaining
 Q
DD+QDE=(1430 -55P)+(1470 -70P)
 =2900 -125P
This generates the line segment EF in Figure 4.12.
At all prices above point C, however, there is no export demand, so that 
world demand and domestic demand are identical. As a result, for all prices above C, world demand is given by line segment AE. (If we were to add Q
DE for 
prices above C, we would be incorrectly adding a negative export demand to 
a positive domestic demand.) As the figure shows, the resulting total demand for wheat, given by AEF, is kinked. The kink occurs at point E, the price level 
above which there is no export demand.
Speculative Demand 
So far in our treatment of demand, we have assumed that consumers are “ratio-nal,” in that they allocate their income among various goods and services to max-imize their overall satisfaction. At times, however, the demands for some goods are based not on the satisfaction one obtains from actually consuming the good, but instead on the belief that the price of the good will rise. In that case, it might be possible to profit by buying the good and then reselling it later at a higher price. This speculative demand is partly to blame for the sharp increases in hous-ing prices that occurred in the U.S., Europe, and China during the past decade.
Speculative demand is often (but as we will explain in Chapter 5, not always) 
irrational. People see that the price of a good has been rising, and somehow conclude that the price will therefore keep rising. But there is usually no rational 
• speculative demand   
Demand driven not by the direct benefits one obtains from owning or consuming a good but instead by an expectation that the price of the good will increase.
EXAMPLE 4.4  THE DEMAND FOR HOUSING
Housing is typically the most 
important single expenditure in a household’s budget—on average, households spend 25 percent of their income on housing. A fam-ily’s demand for housing depends on the age and status of the household making the purchasing  
decision. One approach to the housing demand is to relate the 
number of rooms per house for each household (the quantity demanded) both to an estimate of the price of an additional room in a house and to the household’s fam-ily income. (Prices of rooms vary because of differences in construc-tion costs, including the price of 
130  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
4This is the starting point of the “affordable” housing debate. For an overview, see John Quigley 
and Steven Raphael, “Is Housing Unaffordable? Why Isn’t It More Affordable,” Journal of Economic 
Perspectives  18 (2004): 191–214.
5Julia L. Hansen, John P . Formby, and W. James Smith, “Estimating the Income Elasticity of Demand 
for Housing: A Comparison of Traditional and Lorenz-Concentration Curve Methodologies,” Journal 
of Housing Economics  7 (1998): 328–42.land.) Table 4.4 lists price and income elasticities for 
different demographic groups.
There are significant differences among subgroups 
of the population. For example, families with young household heads have a price elasticity of −0.25, which is more price elastic than the demands of fami-lies with older household heads. Presumably, families buying houses are more price sensitive when parents and their children are younger and there may be plans for more children. Among married households, the income elasticity of demand for rooms also increases with age, which tells us that older households buy larger houses than younger households.
For poor families, the fraction of income spent on 
housing is large. For instance, renters with an income in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution spend roughly 55 percent of their income on housing, as compared to 2.8 percent of income for households overall.
4 Many government programs, such as sub-
sidies, rent controls, and land-use regulations, have been proposed to shape the housing market in ways that might ease the housing burden on the poor.
How effective are income subsidies? If the sub-
sidy increases the demand for housing substantially, then we can presume that the subsidy will lead to improved housing for the poor.
5 On the other hand, 
if the extra money were spent on items other than housing, the subsidy will have failed to address pol-icy concerns related to  housing.
The evidence indicates that for poor house-
holds (with incomes in the bottom tenth percentile of all households), the income elasticity of hous-ing is only about 0.09, which implies that income  subsidies would be spent primarily on items other than  housing. By comparison, the income elasticity 
for housing among the wealthiest households (the top 10 percent) is about 0.54.
This discussion assumes that consumers choose 
their expenditures on housing and other goods to maximize their overall satisfaction, where the ben-efits of housing (and thus the demand for housing) arise from the amount of living space, the safety of the neighborhood, the quality of schools, etc. In recent years, however, the demand for housing has been partly driven by speculative demand: People bought homes under the assumption that they can re-sell the homes in the future at a much higher price. Speculative demand—demand driven not by the direct benefits one obtains from owning a home but instead by an expectation that the price will increase—has caused housing prices in many parts of the United States to increase sharply, far more than could be justified by demographics.
Speculative demand can lead to a bubble—an 
increase in price based not on the fundamentals of demand, but instead on a belief that the price will keep going up. Eventually, bubbles burst—the price stops rising as new buyers stop coming into the mar-ket, owners of the good become alarmed and start to sell, the price drops, more people sell, and the price drops further. As we will see in Chapter 5, bubbles are problematic because they can distort the func-tioning of a market and lead to financial dislocations when they burst. That is what happened to the U.S. housing market, which experienced a housing price bubble that finally burst in 2008, leading to mort-gage defaults and contributing to the financial crisis that hit the U.S. and the global economy in late 2008.TABLE 4.4  PRICE AND INCOME ELASTICITIES OF THE DEMAND FOR ROOMS

EXAMPLE 4.5  THE LONG-RUN DEMAND FOR GASOLINE
Among industrialized countries, 
the United States is unique in that the price of gasoline is relatively low. The reason is simple: Europe, Japan, and other countries have stiff taxes on gasoline, so that gas prices are typically double or triple that in the United States, which imposes very low taxes on gasoline. Many economists have argued that the United States should substantially increase its tax on gasoline, because doing so would lower gasoline consumption and thereby reduce dependence on imported oil and reduce the greenhouse gas emis-sions that contribute to global warming (in addition to providing much-needed revenue to the govern-ment). Politicians have resisted, however, because they fear that a tax increase would anger voters.
Putting the politics of a gas tax aside, would higher 
gasoline prices indeed reduce gasoline consumption, or are drivers so wedded to big gas-guzzling cars that higher prices would make little difference? What matters here is the long-run  demand for gasoline, 
because we can’t expect drivers to immediately scrap their old cars and buy new ones fol-
lowing a price increase. One way to get at the long-run demand curve is by looking at per-capital consump-tion of gasoline in different coun-tries which historically have had very different prices (because they imposed different gasoline taxes). Figure 4.13 does just that. It plots 
the per-capita consumption of gasoline on the vertical axis and the price in dollars per gallon for 10 coun-tries on the horizontal axis.
6 (Each circle represents the 
population of the corresponding country.)
Note that the United States has had by far the low-
est gasoline prices and also the highest per-capita gas-oline consumption. Australia is roughly in the middle in terms of prices, and likewise in terms of consumption. Most of the European countries, on the other hand, have much higher prices and correspondingly lower per capita consumption levels. The long-run elasticity of demand for gasoline turns out to be about −1.4.
Now we come back to our question: Would higher 
gasoline prices reduce gasoline consumption? Figure 4.13 provides a clear answer: Most definitely.

basis for the “therefore,” so that a consumer who buys something because he 
believes the price will keep rising is often doing little more than gambling.
4.4  Consumer Surplus
Consumers buy goods because the purchase makes them better off. Consumer sur-
plus  measures how much  better off individuals are, in the aggregate, because they 
can buy goods in the market. Because different consumers place different values on the consumption of particular goods, the maximum amount they are willing to pay for those goods also differs. Individual consumer surplus is the difference between the 
maximum amount that a consumer is willing to pay for a good and the amount that the con-sumer actually pays.  Suppose, for example, that a student would have been willing 
to pay $13 for a rock concert ticket even though she only had to pay $12. The $1 dif-ference is her consumer surplus.
7 When we add the consumer surpluses of all con-
sumers who buy a good, we obtain a measure of the aggregate  consumer surplus.
Consumer Surplus and Demand
Consumer surplus can be calculated easily if we know the demand curve. To 
see the relationship between demand and consumer surplus, let’s examine the individual demand curve for concert tickets shown in Figure 4.14. (Although the  following discussion applies to this particular individual demand curve, a similar argument also applies to a market demand curve.) Drawing the demand curve as a staircase rather than a straight line shows us how to measure the value that our consumer obtains from buying different numbers of tickets.• consumer surplus  
Difference between what a consumer is willing to pay  for a good and the amount actually paid.
7Measuring consumer surplus in dollars involves an implicit assumption about the shape of consum-
ers’ indifference curves: namely, that the marginal utility associated with increases in a consumer’s income remains constant within the range of income in question. In many cases, this is a reasonable assumption. It may be suspect, however, when large changes in income are involved.Price

CONSUMER SURPLUS
Consumer surplus is the total ben-
efit from the consumption of a prod-uct, less the total cost of purchasing it. Here, the consumer surplus asso-ciated with six concert tickets (pur-chased at $14 per ticket) is given by the yellow-shaded area.CHAPTER 4   •  Individual and Market Demand  133
When deciding how many tickets to buy, our student might reason as  follows: 
The first ticket costs $14 but is worth $20. This $20 valuation is obtained by using the demand curve to find the maximum amount that she will pay for each additional  ticket 
($20 being the maximum that she will pay for the first ticket). The first ticket is worth 
purchasing because it generates $6 of surplus value above and beyond its cost. The second ticket is also worth buying because it generates a surplus of $5 ($19  -  $14). 
The third ticket generates a surplus of $4. The fourth, however, generates a surplus of only $3, the fifth a surplus of $2, and the sixth a surplus of just $1. Our student is indifferent about purchasing the seventh ticket (which  generates zero  surplus) and prefers not to buy any more than that because the value of each additional ticket is less than its cost. In Figure 4.14, consumer surplus is found by adding the excess values 
or surpluses for all units  purchased.  In this case, then, consumer surplus equals
$6+$5+$4+$3+$2+$1=$21
To calculate the aggregate consumer surplus in a market, we sim-
ply find the area below the market  demand curve and above the price line. 
For our rock concert example, this principle is illustrated in Figure 4.15. Now, because the number of tickets sold is measured in thousands and individuals’ demand curves differ, the market demand curve appears as a straight line. Note that the actual expenditure on tickets is 6500 /H11003 
$14 /H11005 $91,000. Consumer surplus, shown as the yellow-shaded triangle, is
1/2 *($20 -$14) *6500=$19,500
This amount is the total benefit to  consumers, less what they paid for the tickets.
Of course, market demand curves are not always straight lines. Nonetheless, 
we can always measure consumer surplus by finding the area below the demand curve and above the price line.

Air is free in the sense that we 
don’t pay to breathe it. But the 
absence of a market for air may 
help explain why the air quality 
in some cities has been dete-
riorating for decades. To encour-
age cleaner air, Congress passed 
the Clean Air Act in 1977 and 
has since amended it a number 
of times. In 1990, for example, automobile emis-
sions controls were tightened. Were these controls 
worth it? Were the benefits of cleaning up the air 
sufficient to outweigh the costs imposed directly 
on car producers and indirectly on car buyers?
To answer these questions,Congress asked the 
National Academy of Sciences to evaluate  emissions 
controls in a cost-benefit study. Using empirically determined estimates of the 
demand for clean air, the benefits 
portion of the study determined 
how much people value clean air. 
Although there is no actual mar-
ket for clean air, people do pay 
more for houses where the air is 
clean than for comparable houses 
in areas with dirtier air. This infor-
mation was used to estimate the demand for clean 
air.8 Detailed data on house prices in neighborhoods 
of Boston and Los Angeles were compared with the 
levels of various air pollutants. The effects of other 
variables that might affect house values were taken 
into account statistically. The study determined 
a demand curve for clean air that looked approxi-
mately like the one shown in Figure 4.16.
8The results are summarized in Daniel L. Rubinfeld, “Market Approaches to the Measurement of the 
Benefits of Air Pollution Abatement,” in Ann Friedlaender, ed., The Benefits and Costs of Cleaning the

VALUING CLEANER AIR
The yellow-shaded triangle 
gives the consumer surplus 
generated when air pollution 
is reduced by 5 parts per 100 
million of nitrogen oxide at 
a cost of $1000 per part re-
duced. The surplus is  created 
because most consumers 
are willing to pay more than 
$1000 for each unit reduction 
of nitrogen oxide.APPLYING CONSUMER SURPLUS  Consumer surplus has important applica-
tions in economics. When added over many individuals, it measures the aggregate 
benefit that consumers obtain from buying goods in a market. When we combine 
consumer surplus with the aggregate profits that producers obtain, we can eval-
uate both the costs and benefits not only of alternative market structures, but of  
public policies that alter the behavior of consumers and firms in those markets.
EXAMPLE 4.6  THE VALUE OF CLEAN AIRCHAPTER 4   •  Individual and Market Demand  135
The horizontal axis measures the amount of air 
pollution reduction , as exemplified by a level of 
nitrogen oxides (NOX) of 10 parts per 100 million (pphm); the vertical axis measures the increased value of a home associated with those reductions. Consider, for example, the demand for cleaner air of a homeowner in a city in which the air is rather dirty. If the family were required to pay $1000 for each  
1 pphm reduction in air pollution, it would choose A 
on the demand curve in order to obtain a pollution reduction of 5 pphm.
How much is a 50-percent, or 5-pphm, reduction 
in pollution worth to this same family? We can mea-sure this value by calculating the consumer surplus associated with reducing air pollution. Because the price for this reduction is $1000 per unit, the family would pay $5000. However, the family values all but the last unit of reduction by more than $1000. As a result, the yellow-shaded  triangle in Figure 4.16 gives 
the value of the cleanup (above and beyond the pay-ment). Because the demand curve is a straight line, the surplus can be  calculated from the area of the 
triangle whose height is $1000 ($2000  -  $1000) and 
whose base is 5 pphm. Therefore, the value to the household of the nitrogen oxide  pollution reduction 
is $2500.
A more recent study that focused on suspended 
participates also found that households place  substantial value on air pollution reduction.
9 A 
 one-milligram per cubic meter reduction in total 
suspended particulates (from a mean of about 60 milligrams per cubic meter) was valued at $2,400 per household.
A complete cost-benefit analysis would use a 
measure of the total benefit of the cleanup—the benefit per household times the number of house-holds. This figure could be compared with the total cost of the cleanup to determine whether such a project was worthwhile. We will discuss clean air further in Chapter 18, when we describe the trade-able emissions permits that were introduced by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
9Kenneth Y. Chay and Michael Greenstone, “Does Air Quality Matter? Evidence from the Housing 
Market,” Journal of Political Economy  113 (2005): 376–424.4.5  Network Externalities
So far, we have assumed that people’s demands for a good are independent of 
one another. In other words, Tom’s demand for coffee depends on Tom’s tastes and income, the price of coffee, and perhaps the price of tea. But it does not depend on Dick’s or Harry’s demand for coffee. This assumption has enabled us to obtain the market demand curve simply by summing individuals’ demands.
For some goods, however, one person’s demand also depends on the 
demands of other  people. In particular, a person’s demand may be affected by 
the number of other people who have purchased the good. If this is the case, there exists a network externality.  Network externalities can be positive or neg-
ative. A positive  network externality exists if the quantity of a good demanded by a 
typical consumer increases in response to the growth in purchases of other consumers.  If 
the quantity demanded decreases, there is a negative  network externality.
Positive Network Externalities
One example of a positive network externality is word processing. Many 
 students use Microsoft Word in part because their friends and many of their professors do as well. That allows us to send and receive drafts without the need to convert from one program to another. The more people use a particular prod-uct or participate in a particular activity, the greater the intrinsic value of that activity or product to each individual.
Social network websites provide another good example. If I am the only 
member of that site, it will have no value to me. But the greater number of • network externality
Situation in which each 
individual’s demand depends on the purchases of other individuals.136  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
 people who join the site, the more valuable it will become. If one social network-
ing site has a small advantage in terms of market share early on, the advantage will grow, because new members will prefer to join the larger site. Hence the huge success of personal website Facebook and professional website LinkedIn. A  similar story holds for virtual worlds and for multiplayer online games.
Another example of a positive network externality is the bandwagon effect —
the desire to be in style, to possess a good because almost everyone else has it, or to indulge a fad. The bandwagon effect often arises with children’s toys (video games, for example). In fact, exploiting this effect is a major objective in market-ing and advertising toys. Often it is the key to success in selling clothing.
Positive network externalities are illustrated in Figure 4.17, in which the hori-
zontal axis measures the sales of a product in thousands per month. Suppose con-sumers think that only 20,000 people have purchased a certain product. Because this is a small number relative to the total population, consumers will have little incentive to buy the product. Some consumers may still buy it (depending on price), but only for its intrinsic value. In this case demand is given by the curve D
20. (This hypothetical demand curve assumes that there are no externalities.)
Suppose instead that consumers think 40,000 people have bought the prod-
uct. Now they find it more attractive and want to buy more. The demand curve is D
40, which is to the right of D20. Similarly, if consumers think that 60,000 peo-
ple have bought the product, the demand curve will be D60, and so on. The more 
people consumers believe to have purchased the product, the farther to the right the demand curve shifts.
Ultimately, consumers will get a good sense of how many people have in 
fact purchased a product. This number will depend, of course, on its price. In Figure 4.17, for example, we see that if the price were $30, then 40,000 people would buy the product. Thus the relevant demand curve would be D
40. If the 
price were $20, 80,000 people would buy the product and the relevant demand curve would be D
80. The market demand curve is therefore found by joining the • bandwagon effect  Positive 
network externality in which a consumer wishes to possess a good in part because others do.

POSITIVE NETWORK  
EXTERNALITY
With a positive network externality, 
the quantity of a good that an individ-ual demands grows in response to the growth of purchases by other individu-als. Here, as the price of the product falls from $30 to $20, the positive exter-nality causes the demand for the good to shift to the right, from D
40 to D80.CHAPTER 4   •  Individual and Market Demand  137
points on the curves  D20, D40, D60, D80, and D100 that correspond to the quantities 
20,000, 40,000, 60,000, 80,000 and 100,000.
Compared with the curves D20, etc., the market demand curve is relatively elastic. 
To see why the positive externality leads to a more elastic demand curve, consider the effect of a drop in price from $30 to $20, with a demand curve of D
40. If there were 
no externality, the quantity demanded would increase from 40,000 to only 48,000. But as more people buy the product, the positive network externality increases the quan-tity demanded further, to 80,000. Thus, the  positive network externality increases the response of demand to price changes—i.e., it makes demand more elastic. As we’ll see later, this result has important implications for producers’ pricing strategies.
Negative Network Externalities
Network externalities are sometimes negative. Congestion offers one example. When skiing, I prefer short lines at ski lifts and fewer skiers on the slopes. As a result, the value of a lift ticket at a ski resort is lower the more people who bought the tickets. Likewise for entry to an amusement park, skating rink, or beach.
Another example of a negative network externality is the snob effect —
the desire to own an exclusive or unique good. The quantity demanded of a “snob good” is higher the fewer  people who own it. Rare works of art, specially 
designed sports cars, and made-to-order clothing are snob goods. The value one gets from a painting or a sports car is partly the prestige, status, and exclusivity resulting from the fact that few other people own one like it.
Figure 4.18 illustrates how a negative network externality works. We will 
assume that the product in question is a snob good, so people value exclusivity. • snob effect  Negative

NEGATIVE NETWORK EXTER-
NALITY: SNOB EFFECT
The snob effect is a negative net-
work externality in which the quan-tity of a good that an individual demands falls in response to the growth of purchases by other indi-viduals. Here, as the price falls from $30,000 to $15,000 and more people buy the good, the snob effect causes the demand for the good to shift to the left, from D
2 to D6.138  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
In the figure, D2 is the demand curve that would apply if consumer believed that 
only 2000 people used the good. If they believe that 4000 people use the good, it would be less exclusive, and so its value decreases. The quantity demanded will therefore be lower; curve D
4 applies. Similarly, if consumers believe that 6000 
people use the good, demand is even smaller and D6 applies. Eventually, con-
sumers learn how widely owned the good actually is. Thus, the market demand curve is found by joining the points on curves D
2, D4, D6, etc., that actually cor-
respond to the quantities 2000, 4000, 6000, etc.
Note that the negative network externality makes market demand less 
 elastic. To see why, suppose the price was initially $30,000 with 2000 peo-ple using the good. What happens when the price is lowered to $15,000? If there were no externality, the quantity purchased would increase to 14,000 (along curve D
2). But the value of the good is greatly reduced if more people 
own it. The negative network externality dampens the increase in the quan-tity demanded, cutting it by 8000 units; the net increase in sales is only to 6000 units.
For a variety of goods, marketing and advertising are geared to creating a 
snob effect. (Think of Rolex watches.) The goal is a very inelastic demand—which makes it possible for firms to charge very high prices.
Negative network externalities can arise for other reasons. Consider the effect 
of congestion in queues. Because I prefer short lines and fewer skiers on the slopes, the value I obtain from a lift ticket at a ski resort is lower the more people there are who have bought tickets. Likewise for entry to an amusement park, skating rink, or beach.
10
10Tastes, of course, differ. Some people associate a positive  network externality with skiing or a day 
on the beach; they enjoy crowds and may even find the slope or beach lonely without them.The social networking website, 
Facebook, began operation in 2004 and had a million users by the end of the year. By early 2011, with over 600 million users, Facebook became the world’s second most visited web-site (after Google). A strong positive network externality was central to Facebook’s success.
To understand this, just ask your-
self why you would join Facebook rather than some other social net-working site. You would join because so many other people have joined. The more friends that also joined, the more useful the site becomes for you as a way to share news and other information with friends. Conversely, if you are the only one of your social circle who does not use 
Facebook, you may find yourself out of the loop with respect to news and upcoming events. With more mem-bers, there are more people to meet or reconnect with, a bigger audience for your photos and opinions, and generally, a larger variety of content for you to enjoy. In Table 4.5, you can see that as the number of Facebook users has grown, the time the aver-age user spent on the site grew as well.
Network externalities have been 
crucial drivers for many modern technologies over many years. 
Telephones, fax machines, email, Craigslist, Second Life, and Twitter are just a few examples.

*4.6  Empirical Estimation of Demand
Later in this book, we will explain how demand information is used as input 
into a firm’s economic decision-making process. General Motors, for example, must understand automobile demand to decide whether to offer rebates or below-market-rate loans for new cars. Knowledge about demand is also impor-tant for public policy decisions. Understanding the demand for oil, for instance, can help Congress decide whether to pass an oil import tax. You may wonder how it is that economists determine the shape of demand curves and how price and income elasticities of demand are actually calculated. In this starred section, we will briefly examine some methods for evaluating and forecasting demand. The section is starred not only because the material is more advanced, but also because it is not essential for much of the later analysis in the book. Nonetheless, this material is instructive and will help you appreciate the empirical founda-tion of the theory of consumer behavior. The basic statistical tools for estimating demand curves and demand elasticities are described in the appendix to this book, entitled “The Basics of Regression.”
The Statistical Approach to Demand Estimation
Firms often rely on market information based on actual studies of demand. Properly applied, the statistical approach to demand estimation can help researchers sort out the effects of variables, such as income and the prices of other products, on the quantity of a product demanded. Here we outline some of the conceptual issues involved in the statistical approach.
Table 4.6 shows the quantity of raspberries sold in a market each year. 
Information about the market demand for raspberries would be valuable to an organization representing growers because it would allow them to predict sales on the basis of their own estimates of price and other demand-determining vari-ables. Let’s suppose that, focusing on demand, researchers find that the quantity of raspberries produced is sensitive to weather conditions but not to the cur-rent market price (because farmers make their planting decisions based on last year’s price).TABLE 4.5 FACEBOOK USERS

The price and quantity data from Table 4.6 are graphed in Figure 4.19. If we 
believe that price alone determines demand, it would be plausible to describe the demand for the product by drawing a straight line (or other appropriate curve), Q /H11005 a /H11002 bP, which “fit” the points as shown by demand curve D. (The “least-
squares” method of curve-fitting is described in the appendix to the book.)
Does curve D (given by the equation Q = 28.2 - 1.00 P) really represent the 
demand for the product? The answer is yes—but only if no important factors other than price affect demand. In Table 4.6, however, we have included data for one other variable: the average income of purchasers of the product. Note that income (I) has increased twice during the study, suggesting that the demand curve has 
shifted twice. Thus demand curves d
1, d2, and d3 in Figure 4.19 give a more likely 
description of demand. This linear demand curve  would be described algebraically as
 Q=a-bP+cI  (4.2)
The income term in the demand equation allows the demand curve to shift in a 
parallel fashion as income changes. The demand relationship, calculated using the least-squares method, is given by Q = 8.08 - .49P + .81I.
The Form of the Demand Relationship
Because the demand relationships discussed above are straight lines, the effect of 
a change in price on quantity demanded is constant. However, the price elasticity of demand varies with the price level. For the demand equation Q = a -  bP, for 
example, the price elasticity E
P is
 EP=(/H9004Q//H9004P)(P/Q)=-b(P/Q) (4.3)
Thus elasticity increases in magnitude as the price increases (and the quantity 
demanded falls).
Consider, for example, the linear demand for raspberries, which was esti-
mated to be Q = 8.08 - .49P + .81I. The elasticity of demand in 1999 (when Q = 16 
and P = 10) is equal to  -.49 (10/16)  = -.31, whereas the elasticity in 2003 (when 
Q = 22 and P = 5) is substantially lower: -.11.TABLE 4.6 DEMAND DATA

There is no reason to expect elasticities of demand to be constant. Nevertheless, 
we often find it useful to work with the isoelastic demand curve , in which the price 
elasticity and the income elasticity are constant. When written in its log-linear 
form , the isoelastic demand curve appears as follows:
 log( Q)=a-b log(P)+c log(I) (4.4)
where log ( ) is the logarithmic function and a, b, and c are the constants in the 
demand equation. The appeal of the log-linear demand relationship is that the slope of the line -b is the price elasticity of demand and the constant c is the 
income elasticity.
11 Using the data in Table 4.5, for example, we obtained the 
regression line
log(Q)=-0.23 -0.34  log(P)+1.33  log(I)
This relationship tells us that the price elasticity of demand for raspberries 
is  - 0.34 (that is, demand is inelastic), and that the income elasticity is 1.33.
We have seen that it can be useful to distinguish between goods that are com-
plements and goods that are substitutes. Suppose that P2 represents the price of 
a second good—one which is believed to be related to the product we are study-ing. We can then write the demand function in the following form:
log(Q)=a-b
 log(P)+b2 log(P2)+c log(I)
When b2, the cross-price elasticity, is positive, the two goods are substitutes; 
when b2 is negative, the two goods are complements.Price

ESTIMATING DEMAND
Price and quantity data can be used to determine 
the form of a demand relationship. But the same data could describe a single demand curve D 
or three demand curves d
1, d2, and d3 that shift 
over time.
11The natural logarithmic function with base e has the property that /H9004(log( Q)) = /H9004Q/Q for any 
change in log( Q). Similarly, /H9004(log( P)) = /H9004P/P for any change in log( P). It follows that /H9004(log( Q)) = 
/H9004Q/Q = - b[/H9004(log( P))] = -b(/H9004P/P). Therefore, ( /H9004Q/Q)/(/H9004P/P) = - b, which is the price elasticity 
of demand. By a similar argument, the income elasticity of demand c is given by ( /H9004Q/Q)/(/H9004I/I).142  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
The specification and estimation of demand curves has been a rapidly grow-
ing endeavor, not only in marketing, but also in antitrust analyses. It is now commonplace to use estimated demand relationships to evaluate the likely effects of mergers.
12 What were once prohibitively costly analyses involving 
mainframe computers can now be carried out in a few seconds on a personal computer. Accordingly, governmental competition authorities and economic and marketing experts in the private sector make frequent use of supermarket scanner data as inputs for estimating demand relationships. Once the price elasticity of demand for a particular product is known, a firm can decide whether it is profitable to raise or lower price. Other things being equal, the lower in magnitude the elasticity, the more likely the profitability of a price increase.

and Critique,” American Law and Economics Review , 1(1999): 386–435.EXAMPLE 4.8  THE DEMAND FOR READY-TO-EAT CEREAL
The Post Cereals division of 
Kraft General Foods acquired the Shredded Wheat cereals of Nabisco in 1995. The acquisition raised the legal and economic question of whether Post would raise the price of its best-selling brand, Grape Nuts, or the price of Nabisco’s most successful brand, Shredded Wheat Spoon Size.
13 
One important issue in a lawsuit brought by the state of New York was whether the two brands were close substitutes for one another. If so, it would be more profitable for Post to increase the price of Grape Nuts (or Shredded Wheat) after
rather than before  the acquisition. Why? Because 
after the acquisition the lost sales from consumers who switched away from Grape Nuts (or Shredded Wheat) would be recovered to the extent that they switched to the substitute product.
The extent to which a price increase will cause 
consumers to switch is given (in part) by the price elasticity of demand for Grape Nuts. Other things being equal, the higher the demand elastic-ity, the greater the loss of sales associated with a price increase. The more likely, too, that the price increase will be unprofitable.
The substitutability of Grape Nuts and Shredded 
Wheat can be measured by the cross-price  elasticity of demand for Grape 
Nuts with respect to the price of Shredded Wheat. The relevant elasticities were calculated using weekly data obtained from super-market scanning of household  purchases for 10 cities over a 
three-year period. One of the esti-mated isoelastic demand equa-tions appeared in the following log-linear form:
log(Q
GN)=1.998 -2.085  log(PGN)+0.62  log(I)
+0.14  log(PSW)
where QGN is the amount (in pounds) of Grape 
Nuts sold weekly, PGN the price per pound of Grape 
Nuts, I real personal income, and PSW the price per 
pound of Shredded Wheat Spoon Size.
The demand for Grape Nuts is elastic (at cur-
rent prices), with a price elasticity of about -2. 
The income elasticity is 0.62: In other words, increases in income lead to increases in cereal purchases, but at less than a 1-for-1 rate. Finally, the cross-price elas-ticity is 0.14. This figure is consistent with the fact that although the two cereals are substitutes (the quantity demanded of Grape Nuts increases in response to an increase in the price of Shredded Wheat), they are not very close substitutes.

Interview and Experimental Approaches  
to Demand Determination
Another way to obtain information about demand is through interviews  in which 
consumers are asked how much of a product they might be willing to buy at a given price. This approach, however, may not succeed when people lack infor-mation or interest or even want to mislead the interviewer. Therefore, market researchers have designed various indirect survey techniques. Consumers might be asked, for example, what their current consumption behavior is and how they would respond if a certain product were available at, say, a  10-percent discount. They might be asked how they would expect others to behave. Although indirect approaches to demand estimation can be fruitful, the difficulties of the interview approach have forced economists and marketing specialists to look to alternative methods.
In direct marketing experiments , actual sales offers are posed to potential 
customers. An airline, for example, might offer a reduced price on certain flights for six months, partly to learn how the price change affects demand for flights and partly to learn how competitors will respond. Alternatively, a cereal company might test market a new brand in Buffalo, New York, and Omaha, Nebraska, with some potential customers being given coupons rang-ing in value from 25 cents to $1 per box. The response to the coupon offer tells the company the shape of the underlying demand curve, helping the market-ers decide whether to market the product nationally and internationally, and at what price.
Direct experiments are real, not hypothetical, but even so, problems remain. 
The wrong experiment can be costly, and even if profits and sales rise, the firm cannot be entirely sure that these increases resulted from the experimental change; other factors probably changed at the same time. Moreover, the response to experiments—which consumers often recognize as short-lived—may differ from the response to permanent changes. Finally, a firm can afford to try only a limited number of experiments.
SUMMARY
 1. Individual consumers’ demand curves for a com-
modity can be derived from information about their tastes for all goods and services and from their budget  constraints.
 2. Engel curves, which describe the relationship between 
the quantity of a good consumed and income, can be useful in showing how consumer expenditures vary with income.
 3. Two goods are substitutes if an increase in the price of 
one leads to an increase in the quantity demanded of the other. In contrast, two goods are complements if an increase in the price of one leads to a decrease in the quantity demanded of the other.
 4. The effect of a price change on the quantity demanded of 
a good can be broken into two parts: a substitution effect, in which the level of utility remains constant while price changes, and an income effect, in which the price remains constant while the level of utility changes. Because the income effect can be positive or negative, a price change can have a small or a large effect on quantity demanded. 
In the unusual case of a so-called Giffen good, the quan-tity demanded may move in the same direction as the price change, thereby generating an upward-sloping individual demand curve.
 5. The market demand curve is the horizontal summa-
tion of the individual demand curves of all consumers in the market for a good. It can be used to calculate how much people value the consumption of particular goods and services.
 6. Demand is price inelastic when a 1-percent increase 
in price leads to a less than 1-percent decrease in  quantity demanded, thereby increasing the consumer’s expenditure. Demand is price elastic when a 1-per cent  
increase in price leads to a more than 1-percent decrease in quantity demanded, thereby decreasing the consumer’s expenditure. Demand is unit elastic when a 1-percent increase in price leads to a 1-percent decrease in quantity demanded.144  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets

 12. Explain the difference between a positive and a 
negative network externality and give an example  of each.   7. The concept of consumer surplus can be useful in 
determining the benefits that people receive from the consumption of a product. Consumer surplus is the  difference between the maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay for a good and what he actually pays for it.
   8. In some instances demand will be speculative , driven 
not by the direct benefits one obtains from owning or consuming a good but instead by an expectation that the price of the good will increase.
   9. A network externality occurs when one person’s 
demand is affected directly by the purchasing or usage decisions of other consumers. There is a positive net-work externality when a typical consumer’s quantity demanded increases because others have purchased 
or are using the product or service. Conversely, there is a negative network externality when quantity demanded increases because fewer people own or use the product or service.
 10. A number of methods can be used to obtain informa-
tion about consumer demand. These include interview and experimental approaches, direct marketing exper-iments, and the more indirect statistical approach. The statistical approach can be very powerful in its appli-cation, but it is necessary to determine the appropri-ate variables that affect demand before the statistical  work is done.CHAPTER 4   •  Individual and Market Demand  145

Demand Theory—A Mathematical  
Treatment
This appendix presents a mathematical treatment of the basics of demand  
theory. Our goal is to provide a short overview of the theory of demand for students who have some familiarity with the use of calculus. To do this, we will explain and then apply the concept of constrained optimization.
Utility Maximization
The theory of consumer behavior is based on the assumption that consumers maximize utility subject to the constraint of a limited budget. We saw in Chapter 3 that for each consumer, we can define a utility function  that attaches a level of util-
ity to each market basket. We also saw that the marginal utility  of a good is defined 
as the change in utility associated with a one-unit increase in the consumption of the good. Using calculus, as we do in this appendix, we measure marginal utility as the utility change that results from a very small increase in consumption.
Suppose, for example, that Bob’s utility function is given by U(X, Y) = log X  + 
log Y, where, for the sake of generality, X is now used to represent food and 
Y represents clothing. In that case, the marginal utility associated with the 
additional consumption of X is given by the partial derivative of the utility function 
with respect to good X.  Here, MU
X, representing the marginal utility of good X, is 
given by
0U(X, Y)
0X=0(log X+log Y)
0X=1
X
In the following analysis, we will assume, as in Chapter 3, that while the level 
of utility is an increasing  function of the quantities of goods consumed, marginal 
utility decreases  with consumption. When there are two goods, X and Y, the con-
sumer’s optimization problem may thus be written as
 Maximize U(X, Y) (A4.1)
subject to the constraint that all income is spent on the two goods: P
XX+PYY=1 (A4.2)
Here, U( ) is the utility function, X and Y the quantities of the two goods pur-
chased, PX and PY the prices of the goods, and I income.1
To determine the individual consumer’s demand for the two goods, we 
choose those values of X and Y that maximize (A4.1) subject to (A4.2). When 
we know the particular form of the utility function, we can solve to find the In §3.1, we explain that a 
utility function is a formula that assigns a level of utility to each market basket.
In §3.5, marginal utility is described as the additional satisfaction obtained by consuming an additional amount of a good.
1To simplify the mathematics, we assume that the utility function is continuous (with continuous 
derivatives) and that goods are infinitely divisible. The logarithmic function log (.) measures the natural logarithm of a number.
 149150  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
consumer’s demand for X and Y directly. However, even if we write the utility 
function in its general form U(X, Y), the technique of constrained optimization  can 
be used to describe the conditions that must hold if the consumer is maximizing utility.
The Method of Lagrange Multipliers
The method of Lagrange multipliers  is a technique that can be used to max-
imize or minimize a function subject to one or more constraints. Because we will use this technique to analyze production and cost issues later in the book, we will provide a step-by-step application of the method to the problem of finding the consumer’s optimization given by equations (A4.1) and (A4.2).
 1. Stating the Problem  First, we write the Lagrangian for the problem. The 
Lagrangian  is the function to be maximized or minimized (here, utility 
is being maximized), plus a variable which we call /H9261 times the constraint 
(here, the consumer’s budget constraint). We will interpret the meaning of /H9261 in a moment. The Lagrangian is then
 /H9021=U(X,
 Y)-l(PXX+PYY-I) (A4.3)
Note that we have written the budget constraint as
PXX+PYY-I=0
i.e., as a sum of terms that is equal to zero. We then insert this sum into the 
Lagrangian.
 2. Differentiating the Lagrangian  If we choose values of X and Y that satisfy 
the budget constraint, then the second term in equation (A4.3) will be zero. Maximizing will therefore be equivalent to maximizing U(X, Y ). By differ-
entiating /H9021 with respect to X, Y, and /H9261 and then equating the derivatives to 
zero, we can obtain the necessary conditions for a maximum.
2 The result-
ing equations are
0/H9021
0X=MU X(X, Y)-lPX=0
 0/H9021
0Y=MU Y(X, Y)-lPY=0 (A4.4)
0/H9021
0l =I-PXX-PYY=0
Here as before, MU is short for marginal utility : In other words, MUX(X, Y ) = 
/H11128U(X, Y )//H11128X, the change in utility from a very small increase in the consump-
tion of good X.• method of Lagrange 
multipliers  Technique 
to maximize or minimize a function subject to one or more constraints.
• Lagrangian  Function to be 
maximized or minimized, plus a variable (the Lagrange multiplier ) 
multiplied by the constraint.
2These conditions are necessary for an “interior” solution in which the consumer consumes positive 
amounts of both goods. The solution, however, could be a “corner” solution in which all of one good and none of the other is consumed.CHAPTER 4   •  Individual and Market Demand  151
 3. Solving the Resulting Equations  The three equations in (A4.4) can be 
rewritten as
 MU X=lPX
 MU Y=lPY
 PXX+PYY=I
Now we can solve these three equations for the three unknowns. The resulting 
values of X and Y are the solution to the consumer’s optimization problem: They 
are the utility-maximizing quantities.
The Equal Marginal Principle
The third equation above is the consumer’s budget constraint with which we started. The first two equations tell us that each good will be consumed up to the point at which the marginal utility from consumption is a multiple ( /H9261) of the 
price of the good. To see the implication of this, we combine the first two condi-tions to obtain the equal marginal principle :
 l =MU
X(X, Y)
PX=MU Y(X, Y)
PY (A4.5)
In other words, the marginal utility of each good divided by its price is the same. 
To optimize, the consumer must get the same utility from the last dollar spent by con-
suming either X or Y.  If this were not the case, consuming more of one good and 
less of the other would increase utility.
To characterize the individual’s optimum in more detail, we can rewrite the 
information in (A4.5) to obtain
 MU X(X, Y)
MU Y(X, Y)=PX
PY (A4.6)
In other words, the ratio of the marginal utilities is equal to the ratio of the prices.
Marginal Rate of Substitution
We can use equation (A4.6) to see the link between utility functions and indiffer-
ence curves that was spelled out in Chapter 3. An indifference curve represents all market baskets that give the consumer the same level of utility. If U* is a fixed 
utility level, the indifference curve that corresponds to that utility level is given by
U(X,
 Y)=U*
As the market baskets are changed by adding small amounts of X and sub-
tracting small amounts of Y, the total change in utility must equal zero. Therefore,
 MU X(X, Y)dX+MU Y(X, Y)dY=dU*=0 (A4.7)In §3.5, we show that the 
marginal rate of substitution is equal to the ratio of the marginal utilities of the two goods being consumed.152  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
Rearranging,
 -dY/dX=MU X(X, Y)/MU Y(X, Y)=MRS XY (A4.8)
where MRSXY represents the individual’s marginal rate of substitution of X 
for Y. Because the left-hand side of (A4.8) represents the negative of the slope of 
the indifference curve, it follows that at the point of tangency, the individual’s marginal rate of substitution (which trades off goods while keeping utility con-stant) is equal to the individual’s ratio of marginal utilities, which in turn is equal to the ratio of the prices of the two goods, from (A4.6).
3
When the individual indifference curves are convex, the tangency of 
the indifference curve to the budget line solves the consumer’s optimiza-tion problem. This principle was illustrated by Figure 3.13 (page 86) in  
Chapter 3.
Marginal Utility of Income
Whatever the form of the utility function, the Lagrange multiplier /H9261 represents 
the extra utility generated when the budget constraint is relaxed—in this case by adding one dollar to the budget. To show how the principle works, we differen-tiate the utility function U(X, Y ) totally with respect to I:
 dU/dI=MU
X(X, Y)(dX/dI)+MU Y(X, Y)(dY/dI) (A4.9)
Because any increment in income must be divided between the two goods, it 
follows that
 dI=PXdX+PYdY (A4.10)
Substituting from (A4.5) into (A4.9), we get dU/dI=lP
X(dX/dI)+lPY(dY/dI)=l(PXdX+PYdY)/dI (A4.11)
and substituting (A4.10) into (A4.11), we get dU/dI=l(P
XdX+PYdY)/(PXdX+PYdY)=l  (A4.12)
Thus the Lagrange multiplier  is the extra utility that results from an extra dollar 
of income.
Going back to our original analysis of the conditions for utility maximization, 
we see from equation (A4.5) that maximization requires the utility obtained from the consumption of every good, per dollar spent on that good, to be equal to the marginal utility of an additional dollar of income. If this were not the case, utility could be increased by spending more on the good with the higher ratio of marginal utility to price and less on the other good.
3We implicitly assume that the “second-order conditions” for a utility maximum hold. The con-
sumer, therefore, is maximizing rather than minimizing utility. The convexity condition is suffi-cient for the second-order conditions to be satisfied. In mathematical terms, the condition is that d(MRS)/ dX 6 0 or that dY
2/dX2 7 0 where - dY/dX  is the slope of the indifference curve. Remember: 
diminishing marginal utility is not sufficient to ensure that indifference curves are convex.CHAPTER 4   •  Individual and Market Demand  153
An Example
In general, the three equations in (A4.4) can be solved to determine the three 
unknowns X, Y , and /H9261 as a function of the two prices and income. Substitution 
for /H9261 then allows us to solve for the demand for each of the two goods in terms 
of income and the prices of the two commodities. This principle can be most  
easily seen in terms of an example.
A frequently used utility function is the Cobb-Douglas utility function,  
which can be represented in two forms:
U(X, Y)=a log(X)+(1-a) log(Y)
and
U(X, Y)=XaY1-a
For the purposes of demand theory, these two forms are equivalent because they 
both yield the identical demand functions for goods X and Y. We will derive the 
demand functions for the first form and leave the second as an exercise for the student.
To find the demand functions for X and Y, given the usual budget constraint, 
we first write the Lagrangian:
/H9021=a
  log( X)+(1-a)log( Y)-l(PXX+PYY-I)
Now differentiating with respect to X, Y, and /H9261 and setting the derivatives equal 
to zero, we obtain
0 /H9021/0X=a/X-lPX=0
0 /H9021/0Y=(1-a)/Y-lPY=0
0 /H9021/0l =PXX+PYY-I=0
The first two conditions imply that P
XX=a/l  (A4.13)
 PYY=(1-a)/l  (A4.14)
Combining these expressions with the last condition (the budget constraint) 
gives us
a/l +(1-a)/l -I=0
or /H9261 = 1/I. Now we can substitute this expression for /H9261 back into (A4.13) and 
(A4.14) to obtain the demand functions:
X=(a/PX)I
Y=[(1-a)/PY]I
In this example, the demand for each good depends only on the price of that 
good and on income, not on the price of the other good. Thus, the cross-price elasticities of demand are 0.• Cobb-Douglas utility 
function  Utility function U(X,Y) 
= XaY1−a, where X and Y are two 
goods and a is a constant.
In §2.4, we explain that  
the cross-price elasticity  of demand refers to the  percentage change in the quantity demanded of one good that results from a 1-percent increase in the price of another good.154  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
We can also use this example to review the meaning of Lagrange multipli-
ers. To do so, let’s substitute specific values for each of the parameters in the problem. Let a = 1/2, P
X = $1, PY = $2, and I = $100. In this case, the choices that 
maximize utility are X = 50 and Y = 25. Also note that /H9261 = 1/100. The Lagrange 
multiplier tells us that if an additional dollar of income were available to the consumer, the level of utility achieved would increase by 1/100. This conclu-sion is relatively easy to check. With an income of $101, the maximizing choices of the two goods are X = 50.5 and Y = 25.25. A bit of arithmetic tells us that the 
original level of utility is 3.565 and the new level of utility 3.575. As we can see, the additional dollar of income has indeed increased utility by .01, or 1/100.
Duality in Consumer Theory
There are two different ways of looking at the consumer’s optimization deci-sion. The optimum choice of X and Y can be analyzed not only as the problem 
of choosing the highest indifference curve—the maximum value of U( )—that 
touches the budget line, but also as the problem of choosing the lowest budget line—the minimum budget expenditure—that touches a given indifference curve. We use the term duality  to refer to these two perspectives. To see how 
this principle works, consider the following dual consumer optimization problem: the problem of minimizing the cost of achieving a particular level of utility:
Minimize P
XX+PYY
subject to the constraint that
U(X, Y)=U*
The corresponding Lagrangian is given by /H9021 =P
XX+PYY-μ(U(X, Y)-U*) (A4.15)
where μ is the Lagrange multiplier. Differentiating /H9021 with respect to X, Y, and μ 
and setting the derivatives equal to zero, we find the following necessary condi-tions for expenditure minimization:
P
X-μMU X(X, Y)=0
PY-μMU Y(X, Y)=0
and
U(X, Y)=U*
By solving the first two equations, and recalling (A4.5), we see that
μ =[PX/MU X(X, Y)]=[PY/MU Y(X, Y)]=1/l 
Because it is also true that
MU X(X, Y)/MU Y(X, Y)=MRS XY=PX/PY• duality  Alternative way of 
looking at the consumer’s utility maximization decision: Rather than choosing the highest indifference curve, given a budget constraint, the consumer chooses the lowest budget line that touches a given indifference curve.CHAPTER 4   •  Individual and Market Demand  155
the cost-minimizing choice of X and Y must occur at the point of tangency of the 
budget line and the indifference curve that generates utility U*. Because this is the 
same point that maximized utility in our original problem, the dual expenditure- minimization problem yields the same demand functions that are obtained from the direct utility-maximization problem.
To see how the dual approach works, let’s reconsider our Cobb-Douglas 
example. The algebra is somewhat easier to follow if we use the exponential form of the Cobb-Douglas utility function, U(X, Y ) = X
aY1 - a. In this case, the 
Lagrangian is given by
 /H9021=PXX+PYY-μ[XaY1-a-U*] (A4.16)
Differentiating with respect to X, Y, and μ and equating to zero, we obtain
PX=μaU*/X
PY=μ(1-a)U*/Y
Multiplying the first equation by X and the second by Y and adding, we get
PXX+PYY=μU*
First, we let I be the cost-minimizing expenditure (if the individual did not 
spend all of his income to get utility level U*, U* would not have maximized 
utility in the original problem). Then it follows that μ  = I/U*. Substituting in the 
equations above, we obtain
X=aI/PX and Y=(1-a)I/PY
These are the same demand functions that we obtained before.
Income and Substitution Effects
The demand function tells us how any individual’s utility-maximizing choices 
respond to changes in both income and the prices of goods. It is important, how-ever, to distinguish that portion of any price change that involves movement along 
an indifference curve  from that portion which involves movement to a different indiffer-
ence curve  (and therefore a change in purchasing power). To make this distinction, 
we consider what happens to the demand for good X when the price of X changes. 
As we explained in Section 4.2, the change in demand can be divided into a sub-
stitution effect  (the change in quantity demanded when the level of utility is fixed) 
and an income effect  (the change in the quantity demanded with the level of utility 
changing but the relative price of good X unchanged). We denote the change in X 
that results from a unit change in the price of X, holding utility constant, by
0X/0P
X|U=U*
Thus the total change in the quantity demanded of X resulting from a unit 
change in PX is
 dX/dPX=0X/0PX|U=U*+(0X/0I)(0I/0PX) (A4.17)In §4.2, the effect of a price 
change is divided into an income effect and a substitu-tion effect.156  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
The first term on the right side of equation (A4.17) is the substitution effect 
(because utility is fixed); the second term is the income effect (because income increases).
From the consumer’s budget constraint, I = P
XX + PYY, we know by differen-
tiation that
 0I/0PX=X (A4.18)
Suppose for the moment that the consumer owned goods X and Y. In that case, 
equation (A4.18) would tell us that when the price of good X increases by $1, the 
amount of income that the consumer can obtain by selling the good increases by $X. In our theory of consumer behavior, however, the consumer does not own 
the good. As a result, equation (A4.18) tells us how much additional income the consumer would need in order to be as well off after the price change as he or she was before. For this reason, it is customary to write the income effect as neg-ative (reflecting a loss of purchasing power) rather than as a positive. Equation (A4.17) then appears as follows:
 dX/dP
X=0X/0PX|U=U*-X(0X/0I) (A4.19)
In this new form, called the Slutsky equation,  the first term represents the 
substitution effect : the change in demand for good X obtained by keeping util-
ity fixed. The second term is the income effect : the change in purchasing power 
resulting from the price change times the change in demand resulting from a change in purchasing power.
An alternative way to decompose a price change into substitution and 
income effects, which is usually attributed to John Hicks, does not involve indifference curves. In Figure A4.1, the consumer initially chooses market  basket A on budget line RS. Suppose that after the price of food falls (and the • Slutsky equation  Formula

is no better off (and no worse off) than he was before. To do so, we draw a budget line parallel to RT. If the budget line passed through A, the consumer 
would be at least as satisfied as he was before the price change: He still has the option to purchase market basket A if he wishes. According to the Hicksian 
substitution effect,  therefore, the budget line that leaves him equally well off 
must be a line such as R’T’, which is parallel to RT and which intersects RS at a 
point B below and to the right of point A.
Revealed preference tells us that the newly chosen market basket must lie on 
line segment BT
'. Why? Because all market baskets on line segment R'B could 
have been chosen but were not when the original budget line was RS. (Recall 
that the consumer preferred basket A to any other feasible market basket.) 
Now note that all points on line segment BT' involve more food consumption 
than does basket A. It follows that the quantity of food demanded increases 
whenever there is a decrease in the price of food with utility held constant. This negative substitution effect holds for all price changes and does not rely on the assumption of convexity of indifference curves that we made in  Section 3.1 (page 69).• Hicksian substitution

equation for decomposing price changes without recourse to indifference curves.
In §3.1, we explain that an indifference curve is convex if the marginal rate of sub-stitution diminishes as we move down along the curve.
In §3.4, we explain how infor-mation about consumer pref-erences is revealed through the consumption choices that consumers make.This page intentionally left blank So far, we have assumed that prices, incomes, and other variables are 
known with certainty. However, many of the choices that people make involve considerable uncertainty. Most people, for example, 
borrow to finance large purchases, such as a house or a college education, and plan to pay for them out of future income. But for most of us, future incomes are uncertain. Our earnings can go up or down; we can be pro-moted or demoted, or even lose our jobs. And if we delay buying a house or investing in a college education, we risk price increases that could make such purchases less affordable. How should we take these uncertainties into account when making major consumption or investment decisions?
Sometimes we must choose how much risk to bear. What, for exam-
ple, should you do with your savings? Should you invest your money in something safe, such as a savings account, or something riskier but potentially more lucrative, such as the stock market? Another example is the choice of a job or career. Is it better to work for a large, stable company with job security but slim chance for advancement, or is it better to join (or form) a new venture that offers less job security but more opportunity for advancement?
To answer such questions, we must examine the ways that people 
can compare and choose among risky alternatives. We will do this by taking the following steps:
 1. In order to compare the riskiness of alternative choices, we need 
to quantify risk. We therefore begin this chapter by discussing measures of risk.
 2. We will examine people’s preferences toward risk. Most people 
find risk undesirable, but some people find it more undesirable than others.
 3. We will see how people can sometimes reduce or eliminate risk. 
Sometimes risk can be reduced by diversification, by buying insurance, or by investing in additional information.
 4. In some situations, people must choose the amount of risk they 
wish to bear. A good example is investing in stocks or bonds. We will see that such investments involve trade-offs between the monetary gain that one can expect and the riskiness of that gain.
 5. Sometimes demand for a good is driven partly or entirely by spec-
ulation—people buy the good because they think its price will rise.   5.1

We will see how this can lead to a bubble, where more and more people, 
convinced that the price will keep rising, buy the good and push its price up further—until eventually the bubble bursts and the price plummets.
In a world of uncertainty, individual behavior may sometimes seem unpre-
dictable, even irrational, and perhaps contrary to the basic assumptions of con-sumer theory. In the final section of this chapter, we offer an overview of the flourishing field of behavioral economics, which, by introducing important ideas from psychology, has broadened and enriched the study of microeconomics.
5.1  Describing Risk
To describe risk quantitatively, we begin by listing all the possible outcomes of a particular action or event, as well as the likelihood that each outcome will occur.
1 Suppose, for example, that you are considering investing in a company 
that explores for offshore oil. If the exploration effort is successful, the compa-ny’s stock will increase from $30 to $40 per share; if not, the price will fall to $20 per share. Thus there are two possible future outcomes: a $40-per-share price and a $20-per-share price.
Probability
Probability  is the likelihood that a given outcome will occur. In our example, 
the probability that the oil exploration project will be successful might be 1/4 and the probability that it is unsuccessful 3/4. (Note that the probabilities for all possible events must add up to 1.)
Our interpretation of probability can depend on the nature of the uncertain 
event, on the beliefs of the people involved, or both. One objective  interpretation 
of probability relies on the frequency with which certain events tend to occur. Suppose we know that of the last 100 offshore oil explorations, 25 have suc-ceeded and 75 failed. In that case, the probability of success of 1/4 is objective because it is based directly on the frequency of similar experiences.
But what if there are no similar past experiences to help measure probabil-
ity? In such instances, objective measures of probability cannot be deduced and more subjective measures are needed. Subjective probability  is the perception that 
an outcome will occur. This perception may be based on a person’s judgment or experience, but not necessarily on the frequency with which a particular outcome has actually occurred in the past. When probabilities are subjectively determined, different people may attach different probabilities to different out-comes and thereby make different choices. For example, if the search for oil were to take place in an area where no previous searches had ever occurred, I might attach a higher subjective probability than you to the chance that the project will succeed: Perhaps I know more about the project or I have a better understand-ing of the oil business and can therefore make better use of our common infor-mation. Either different information or different abilities to process the same information can cause subjective probabilities to vary among individuals.• probability  Likelihood that 
a given outcome will occur.
1Some people distinguish between uncertainty and risk along the lines suggested some 60 years ago 
by economist Frank Knight. Uncertainty  can refer to situations in which many outcomes are possible 
but the likelihood of each is unknown. Risk then refers to situations in which we can list all possible 
outcomes and know the likelihood of each occurring. In this chapter, we will always refer to risky situations, but will simplify the discussion by using uncertainty  and risk interchangeably.CHAPTER 5   •  Uncertainty and Consumer Behavior  161
Regardless of the interpretation of probability, it is used in calculating two 
important measures that help us describe and compare risky choices. One mea-sure tells us the expected value  and the other the variability  of the possible outcomes.
Expected Value
The expected value  associated with an uncertain situation is a weighted aver-
age of the payoffs  or values associated with all possible outcomes. The prob-
abilities of each outcome are used as weights. Thus the expected value measures the central tendency —the payoff or value that we would expect on average.
Our offshore oil exploration example had two possible outcomes: Success 
yields a payoff of $40 per share, failure a payoff of $20 per share. Denoting “probability of” by Pr, we express the expected value in this case as
 Expected value =Pr(success)($40/share) +Pr(failure)($20/share)
 =(1/4)($40/share) +(3/4)($20/share) =$25/share
More generally, if there are two possible outcomes having payoffs X
1 and X2 and 
if the probabilities of each outcome are given by Pr1 and Pr2, then the expected 
value is
E(X)=Pr1X1+Pr2X2
When there are n possible outcomes, the expected value becomes
E(X)=Pr1X1+Pr2X2+c +PrnXn
Variability
Variability  is the extent to which the possible outcomes of an uncertain situation 
differ. To see why variability is important, suppose you are choosing between two part-time summer sales jobs that have the same expected income ($1500). The first job is based entirely on commission—the income earned depends on how much you sell. There are two equally likely payoffs for this job: $2000 for a successful sales effort and $1000 for one that is less successful. The second job is salaried. It is very likely (.99 probability) that you will earn $1510, but there is a .01 probability that the company will go out of business, in which case you would earn only $510 in severance pay. Table 5.1 summarizes these possible outcomes, their payoffs, and their probabilities.
Note that these two jobs have the same expected income. For Job 1, expected 
income is .5($2000) /H11001 .5($1000) /H11005 $1500; for Job 2, it is .99($1510) /H11001 .01($510) /H11005 
$1500. However, the variability  of the possible payoffs is different. We measure • expected value  Probability-
weighted average of the payoffs associated with all possible outcomes.
• payoff  Value associated with 
a possible outcome.
• variability  Extent to which 
possible outcomes of an uncertain event differ.

variability by recognizing that large differences between actual and expected pay-
offs (whether positive or negative) imply greater risk. We call these differences  deviations.  Table 5.2 shows the deviations of the possible income from the expected 
income from each job.
By themselves, deviations do not provide a measure of variability. Why? 
Because they are sometimes positive and sometimes negative, and as you can see from Table 5.2, the average of the probability-weighted deviations is always 0.
2 
To get around this problem, we square each deviation, yielding numbers that are always positive. We then measure variability by calculating the standard 
deviation:  the square root of the average of the squares  of the deviations of the 
payoffs associated with each outcome from their expected values.
3
Table 5.3 shows the calculation of the standard deviation for our example. 
Note that the average of the squared deviations under Job 1 is given by
.5($250,000) +.5($250,000) =$250,000
The standard deviation is therefore equal to the square root of $250,000, or $500. 
Likewise, the probability-weighted average of the squared deviations under Job 2 is
.99($100) +.01($980,100) =$9900
The standard deviation is the square root of $9900, or $99.50. Thus the second 
job is much less risky than the first; the standard deviation of the incomes is much lower.
4
The concept of standard deviation applies equally well when there are many 
outcomes rather than just two. Suppose, for example, that the first summer job yields incomes ranging from $1000 to $2000 in increments of $100 that are all equally likely. The second job yields incomes from $1300 to $1700 (again in increments of $100) that are also equally likely. Figure 5.1 shows the alternatives • deviation  Difference

4In general, when there are two outcomes with payoffs X1 and X2, occurring with probability Pr1 
and Pr2, and E(X) is the expected value of the outcomes, the standard deviation is given by s, where
s2=Pr1[(X1-E(X))2]+Pr2[(X2-E(X))2]CHAPTER 5   •  Uncertainty and Consumer Behavior  163
graphically. (If there had been only two equally probable outcomes, then the 
figure would be drawn as two vertical lines, each with a height of 0.5.)
You can see from Figure 5.1 that the first job is riskier than the second. The 
“spread” of possible payoffs for the first job is much greater than the spread for the second. As a result, the standard deviation of the payoffs associated with the first job is greater than that associated with the second.
In this particular example, all payoffs are equally likely. Thus the curves 
describing the probabilities for each job are flat. In many cases, however, some payoffs are more likely than others. Figure 5.2 shows a situation in which the most extreme payoffs are the least likely. Again, the salary from Job 1 has a greater standard deviation. From this point on, we will use the standard  deviation of payoffs to measure the degree of risk.
Decision Making
Suppose you are choosing between the two sales jobs described in our original example. Which job would you take? If you dislike risk, you will take the second job: It offers the same expected income as the first but with less risk. But suppose we add $100 to each of the payoffs in the first job, so that the expected payoff increases from $1500 to $1600. Table 5.4 gives the new earnings and the squared deviations.Probability

The distribution of payoffs associated with Job 1 
has a greater spread and a greater standard de-viation than the distribution of payoffs associated with Job 2. Both distributions are peaked because the extreme payoffs are less likely than those near the middle of the distribution.164  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
The two jobs can now be described as follows:
Job 1: Expected Income /H11005 $1600 Standard Deviation /H11005 $500
Job 2: Expected Income /H11005 $1500 Standard Deviation /H11005 $99.50
Job 1 offers a higher expected income but is much riskier than Job 2. Which job is 
preferred depends on the individual. While an aggressive entrepreneur who doesn’t mind taking risks might choose Job 1, with the higher expected income and higher standard deviation, a more conservative person might choose the second job.
People’s attitudes toward risk affect many of the decisions they make. In 
Example 5.1 we will see how attitudes toward risk affect people’s willingness to break the law, and how this has implications for the fines that should be set for various violations. Then in Section 5.2, we will further develop our theory of consumer choice by examining people’s risk preferences in greater detail.
5This discussion builds indirectly on Gary S. Becker, “Crime and Punishment: An Economic 
Approach,” Journal of Political Economy  (March/April 1968): 169–217. See also A. Mitchell Polinsky 
and Steven Shavell, “The Optimal Tradeoff Between the Probability and the Magnitude of Fines,” American Economic Review  69 (December 1979): 880–91.EXAMPLE 5.1  DETERRING CRIME
Fines may be better than incarceration in deterring 
certain types of crimes, such as speeding, double-parking, tax evasion, and air polluting.
5 A person 
choosing to violate the law in these ways has good information and can reasonably be assumed to be behaving rationally.
Other things being equal, the greater the fine, 
the more a potential criminal will be discouraged from committing the crime. For example, if it cost nothing to catch criminals, and if the crime imposed a calculable cost of $1000 on society, we might choose to catch all violations and impose a fine of $1000 on each. This practice would discourage people whose benefit from engaging in the activity was less than the $1000 fine.
In practice, however, it is very costly to catch law-
breakers. Therefore, we save on administrative costs by imposing relatively high fines (which are no more costly to collect than low fines), while allocating resources so that only a fraction of the  violators are 
apprehended. Thus the size of the fine that must be imposed to discourage criminal behavior depends on the attitudes toward risk of potential violators.
Suppose that a city wants to deter people from 
double-parking. By double-parking, a typical resi-dent saves $5 in terms of his own time for engaging in activities that are more pleasant than searching for a parking space. If it costs nothing to catch a double-parker, a fine of just over $5—say, $6—should be assessed every time he double-parks. This policy will ensure that the net benefit of dou-ble-parking (the $5 benefit less the $6 fine) would be less than zero. Our citizen will therefore choose to obey the law. In fact, all potential violators whose benefit was less than or equal to $5 would be dis-couraged, while a few whose benefit was greater than $5 (say, someone who double-parks because of an emergency) would violate the law.TABLE 5.4 INCOMES FROM SALES JOBS—MODIFIED ($)

In practice, it is too costly to catch all violators. 
Fortunately, it’s also unnecessary. The same deter-rence effect can be obtained by assessing a fine of $50 and catching only one in ten violators (or per-haps a fine of $500 with a one-in-100 chance of being caught). In each case, the expected penalty is $5, i.e., [$50][.1] or [$500][.01]. A policy that combines a high fine and a low probability of apprehension is likely to reduce enforcement costs. This approach is espe-cially effective if drivers don’t like to take risks. In our example, a $50 fine with a .1 probability of being caught might discourage most people from violating 
the law. We will examine  attitudes toward risk in the 
next section.
A new type of crime that has become a  serious 
problem for music and movie producers is  digital 
piracy; it is particularly difficult to catch and fines are rarely imposed. Nevertheless, fines that are levied are often very high. In 2009, a woman was fined $1.9 million for illegally downloading 24 songs. That amounts to a fine of $80,000 per song.
5.2  Preferences Toward Risk
We used a job example to show how people might evaluate risky outcomes, but the principles apply equally well to other choices. In this section, we concentrate on consumer choices generally and on the utility  that consumers obtain from 
choosing among risky alternatives. To simplify things, we’ll consider the util-ity that a consumer gets from his or her income—or, more appropriately, the market basket that the consumer’s income can buy. We now measure payoffs, therefore, in terms of utility rather than dollars.
Figure 5.3 (a) shows how we can describe one woman’s preferences toward 
risk. The curve 0 E, which gives her utility function, tells us the level of utility 
(on the vertical axis) that she can attain for each level of income (measured in thousands of dollars on the horizontal axis). The level of utility increases from 10 to 16 to 18 as income increases from $10,000 to $20,000 to $30,000. But note that marginal utility  is diminishing, falling from 10 when income increases from 
0 to $10,000, to 6 when income increases from $10,000 to $20,000, and to 2 when income increases from $20,000 to $30,000.
Now suppose that our consumer has an income of $15,000 and is considering 
a new but risky sales job that will either double her income to $30,000 or cause it to fall to $10,000. Each possibility has a probability of .5. As Figure 5.3 (a) shows, the utility level associated with an income of $10,000 is 10 (at point A) and the 
utility level associated with an income of $30,000 is 18 (at E). The risky job must 
be compared with the current $15,000 job, for which the utility is 13.5 (at B).
To evaluate the new job, she can calculate the expected value of the resulting 
income. Because we are measuring value in terms of her utility, we must calcu-late the expected utility  E(u) that she can obtain. The expected utility is the sum 
of the utilities associated with all possible outcomes, weighted by the probability that each outcome will occur.  In this case expected utility is
E(u)=(1/2) u($10,000) +(1/2) u($30,000) =0.5(10) +0.5(18) =14
The risky new job is thus preferred to the original job because the expected 
utility of 14 is greater than the original utility of 13.5.
The old job involved no risk—it guaranteed an income of $15,000 and a util-
ity level of 13.5. The new job is risky but offers both a higher expected income ($20,000) and, more importantly, a higher expected utility. If the woman wishes to increase her expected utility, she will take the risky job.In §3.1, we explained that 
a utility function assigns a level of utility to each pos-sible  market basket.
In §3.5, marginal utility is 
described as the additional satisfaction obtained by consuming an additional amount of a good.

the utilities associated with all possible outcomes, weighted by the probability that each outcome will occur.166  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
Different Preferences Toward Risk
People differ in their willingness to bear risk. Some are risk averse, some risk 
loving, and some risk neutral. An individual who is risk averse  prefers a cer-
tain given income to a risky income with the same expected value. (Such a per-son has a diminishing marginal utility of income.) Risk aversion is the most  common attitude toward risk. To see that most people are risk averse most of the time, note that most people not only buy life insurance, health insurance, and car insurance, but also seek occupations with relatively stable wages.
Figure 5.3 (a) applies to a woman who is risk averse. Suppose hypothetically 
that she can have either a certain income of $20,000, or a job yielding an income of $30,000 with probability .5 and an income of $10,000 with probability .5 (so that the expected income is also $20,000). As we saw, the expected utility of the uncertain income is 14—an average of the utility at point A(10) and the utility at 
E(18)—and is shown by F. Now we can compare the expected utility associated 
with the risky job to the utility generated if $20,000 were earned without risk. This latter utility level, 16, is given by D in Figure 5.3 (a). It is clearly greater than 
the expected utility of 14 associated with the risky job.
For a risk-averse person, losses are more important (in terms of the change in 
utility) than gains. Again, this can be seen from Figure 5.3 (a). A $10,000 increase in income, from $20,000 to $30,000, generates an increase in utility of two units; a $10,000 decrease in income, from $20,000 to $10,000, creates a loss of utility of six units.
A person who is risk neutral  is indifferent between a certain income and 
an uncertain income with the same expected value. In Figure 5.3 (c) the utility associated with a job generating an income of either $10,000 or $30,000 with equal probability is 12, as is the utility of receiving a certain income of $20,000. As you can see from the figure, the marginal utility of income is constant for a  risk-neutral person.
6
Finally, an individual who is risk loving  prefers an uncertain income to a 
certain one, even if the expected value of the uncertain income is less than that of the certain income. Figure 5.3 (b) shows this third possibility. In this case, the expected utility of an uncertain income, which will be either $10,000 with prob-ability .5 or $30,000 with probability .5, is higher  than the utility associated with 
a certain income of $20,000. Numerically,
E(u)=.5u($10,000) +.5u($30,000) =.5(3) +.5(18) =10.5 7u($20,000) =8
Of course, some people may be averse to some risks and act like risk  lovers with 
respect to others. For example, many people purchase life insurance and are conservative with respect to their choice of jobs, but still enjoy gambling. Some criminologists might describe criminals as risk lovers, especially if they com-mit crimes despite a high prospect of apprehension and punishment. Except for such special cases, however, few people are risk loving, at least with respect to major purchases or large amounts of income or wealth.
RISK PREMIUM  The risk premium  is the maximum amount of money that a 
risk-averse person will pay to avoid taking a risk. In general, the magnitude • risk averse  Condition of 
preferring a certain income to a risky income with the same expected value.
• risk neutral  Condition of 
being indifferent between a certain income and an uncertain income with the same expected value.
• risk loving  Condition of 
preferring a risky income to a certain income with the same expected value.
• risk premium  Maximum 
amount of money that a risk-averse person will pay to avoid taking a risk.
6Thus, when people are risk neutral, the income they earn can be used as an indicator of well-being. 
A government policy that doubles incomes would then also double their utility. At the same time, government policies that alter the risks that people face, without changing their expected incomes, would not affect their well-being. Risk neutrality allows a person to avoid the complications that might be associated with the effects of governmental actions on the riskiness of outcomes.CHAPTER 5   •  Uncertainty and Consumer Behavior  167
of the risk premium depends on the risky alternatives that the person faces. 
To determine the risk premium, we have reproduced the utility function of Figure 5.3 (a) in Figure 5.4 and extended it to an income of $40,000. Recall that an expected utility of 14 is achieved by a woman who is going to take a risky job with an expected income of $20,000. This outcome is shown graphically by  drawing a horizontal line to the vertical axis from point F, which bisects straight

RISK AVERSE, RISK LOVING, AND RISK NEUTRAL
People differ in their preferences toward risk. In (a), a consumer’s marginal utility diminishes as income  increases. 
The consumer is risk averse because she would prefer a certain income of $20,000 (with a utility of 16) to a gamble with a .5 probability of $10,000 and a .5 probability of $30,000 (and expected utility of 14). In (b), the 
consumer is risk loving: She would prefer the same gamble (with expected utility of 10.5) to the certain income (with a utility of 8). Finally, the consumer in (c) is risk neutral and indifferent between certain and uncertain events 
with the same expected income.168  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
line AE (thus representing an average of $10,000 and $30,000). But the utility 
level of 14 can also be achieved if the woman has a certain  income of $16,000, as 
shown by dropping a vertical line from point C. Thus, the risk premium of $4000, 
given by line segment CF, is the amount of expected income ($20,000 minus 
$16,000) that she would give up in order to remain indifferent between the risky job and a hypothetical job that would pay her a certain income of $16,000.
RISK AVERSION AND INCOME  The extent of an individual’s risk aversion 
depends on the nature of the risk and on the person’s income. Other things being equal, risk-averse people prefer a smaller variability of outcomes. We saw that when there are two outcomes—an income of $10,000 and an income of $30,000—the risk premium is $4000. Now consider a second risky job, also illustrated in Figure 5.4. With this job, there is a .5 probability of receiving an income of $40,000, with a util-ity level of 20, and a .5 probability of getting an income of $0, with a utility level of 0. The expected income is again $20,000, but the expected utility is only 10:
Expected utility =.5u($0) +.5u($40,000) =0+.5(20) =10
Compared to a hypothetical job that pays $20,000 with certainty, the person 
holding this risky job gets 6 fewer units of expected utility: 10 rather than 16 units. At the same time, however, this person could also get 10 units of utility from a job that pays $10,000 with certainty. Thus the risk premium in this case is $10,000, because this person would be willing to give up $10,000 of her $20,000 expected income to avoid bearing the risk of an uncertain income. The greater the variability of income, the more the person would be willing to pay to avoid the risky situation.10 16 20 30 40Risk Premium1820

RISK PREMIUM
The risk premium, CF,  measures the amount of income that an individual would give up to 
leave her indifferent between a risky choice and a certain one. Here, the risk premium is $4000 because a certain  income of $16,000 (at point C) gives her the same expected utility (14) as the 
uncertain income (a .5  probability of being at point A and a .5 probability of being at point E) 
that has an expected value of $20,000.CHAPTER 5   •  Uncertainty and Consumer Behavior  169
RISK AVERSION AND INDIFFERENCE CURVES  We can also describe the 
extent of a person’s risk aversion in terms of indifference curves that relate expected income to the variability of income, where the latter is measured by the standard deviation. Figure 5.5 shows such indifference curves for two indi-viduals, one who is highly risk averse and another who is only slightly risk averse. Each indifference curve shows the combinations of expected income and  standard deviation of income that give the individual the same amount of  utility. Observe that all of the indifference curves are upward sloping: Because risk is undesirable, the greater the amount of risk, the greater the expected income needed to make the individual equally well off.
Figure 5.5 (a) describes an individual who is highly risk averse. Observe that 
in order to leave this person equally well off, an increase in the standard devia-tion of income requires a large increase in expected income. Figure 5.5 (b) applies to a slightly risk-averse person. In this case, a large increase in the standard deviation of income requires only a small increase in expected income.In §3.1, we define an 
 indifference curve as all 
 market baskets that generate 
the same level of satisfaction for a consumer.U3

EXAMPLE 5.2  BUSINESS EXECUTIVES AND THE CHOICE OF RISK
Are business executives more risk loving than most 
people? When they are presented with alternative strategies, some risky, some safe, which do they choose? In one study, 464 executives were asked to respond to a questionnaire describing risky situa-
tions that an individual might face as vice president of a hypothetical company.
7 Respondents were pre-
sented with four risky events, each of which had a 
7This example is based on Kenneth R. MacCrimmon and Donald A. Wehrung, “The Risk In-Basket,”

given probability of a favorable and unfavorable 
outcome. The payoffs and probabilities were chosen so that each event had the same expected value. In increasing order of the risk involved (as measured by the difference between the favorable and unfa-vorable outcomes), the four items were:
1. A lawsuit involving a patent violation
2. A customer threatening to buy from a competitor
3. A union dispute
4. A joint venture with a competitor
To gauge their willingness to take or avoid risks, 
researchers asked respondents a series of questions regarding business strategy. In one situation, they could pursue a risky strategy with the possibility of a high return right away or delay making a choice until the outcomes became more certain and the risk was reduced. In another situation, respondents could opt for an immediately risky but potentially profit-able strategy that could lead to a promotion, or they could delegate the decision to someone else, which would protect their job but eliminate the promotion 
possibility.
The study found that executives vary substantially 
in their preferences toward risk. Roughly 20 percent indicated that they were relatively risk neutral; 40 percent opted for the more risky alternatives; and 20 percent were clearly risk averse (20 percent did not respond). More importantly, executives (includ-ing those who chose risky alternatives) typically made efforts to reduce or eliminate risk, usually by delaying decisions and collecting more information.
Some have argued that a cause of the financial 
crisis of 2008 was excessive risk-taking by bankers and Wall Street executives who could earn huge bonuses if their ventures succeeded but faced very little downside if the ventures failed. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) bailed out some of the banks, but so far has been unable to impose constraints on “unnecessary and excessive” risk-taking by banks’ executives.
We will return to the use of indifference curves as a means of describing risk 
aversion in Section 5.4, where we discuss the demand for risky assets. First, however, we will turn to the ways in which an individual can reduce risk.
5.3  Reducing Risk
As the recent growth in state lotteries shows, people sometimes choose risky alternatives that suggest risk-loving rather than risk-averse behavior. Most people, however, spend relatively small amounts on lottery tickets and casinos. When more important decisions are involved, they are generally risk averse. In this section, we describe three ways by which both consumers and businesses commonly reduce risks: diversification , insurance , and obtaining more information  
about choices and payoffs.
Diversification
Recall the old saying, “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” Ignoring this advice is unnecessarily risky: If your basket turns out to be a bad bet, all will be lost. Instead, you can reduce risk through diversification:  allocating your 
resources to a variety of activities whose outcomes are not closely related.
Suppose, for example, that you plan to take a part-time job selling appliances 
on a commission basis. You can decide to sell only air conditioners or only heat-ers, or you can spend half your time selling each. Of course, you can’t be sure how hot or cold the weather will be next year. How should you apportion your time in order to minimize the risk involved?
Risk can be minimized by diversification —by allocating your time so that you 
sell two or more products (whose sales are not closely related) rather than a • diversification  Practice 
of reducing risk by allocating resources to a variety of activities whose outcomes are not closely related.CHAPTER 5   •  Uncertainty and Consumer Behavior  171
single product. Suppose there is a 0.5 probability that it will be a relatively hot 
year, and a 0.5 probability that it will be cold. Table 5.5 gives the earnings that you can make selling air conditioners and heaters.
If you sell only air conditioners or only heaters, your actual income will be 
either $12,000 or $30,000, but your expected income will be $21,000 (.5[$30,000] /H11001 .5[$12,000]). But suppose you diversify by dividing your time evenly between 
the two products. In that case, your income will certainly be $21,000, regardless of the weather. If the weather is hot, you will earn $15,000 from air conditioner sales and $6000 from heater sales; if it is cold, you will earn $6000 from air con-ditioners and $15,000 from heaters. In this instance, diversification eliminates all risk.
Of course, diversification is not always this easy. In our example, heater and 
air conditioner sales are negatively correlated variables —they tend to move 
in opposite directions; whenever sales of one are strong, sales of the other are weak. But the principle of diversification is a general one: As long as you can allocate your resources toward a variety of activities whose outcomes are not 
closely related, you can eliminate some risk.
THE STOCK MARKET  Diversification is especially important for people who 
invest in the stock market. On any given day, the price of an individual stock can go up or down by a large amount, but some stocks rise in price while oth-ers fall. An individual who invests all her money in a single stock (i.e., puts all her eggs in one basket) is therefore taking much more risk than necessary. Risk can be reduced—although not eliminated—by investing in a portfolio of ten or twenty different stocks. Likewise, you can diversify by buying shares in mutual 
funds:  organizations that pool funds of individual investors to buy a large num-
ber of different stocks. There are thousands of mutual funds available today for both stocks and bonds. These funds are popular because they reduce risk through diversification and because their fees are typically much lower than the cost of assembling one’s own portfolio of stocks.
In the case of the stock market, not all risk is diversifiable. Although some 
stocks go up in price when others go down, stock prices are to some extent  positively correlated variables:  They tend to move in the same direction in 
response to changes in economic conditions. For example, the onset of a severe recession, which is likely to reduce the profits of many companies, may be accompanied by a decline in the overall market. Even with a diversified portfo-lio of stocks, therefore, you still face some risk.
Insurance
We have seen that risk-averse people are willing to pay to avoid risk. In fact, if the cost of insurance is equal to the expected loss (e.g., a policy with an expected loss of $1000 will cost $1000), risk-averse people will buy enough insurance to recover fully from any financial losses they might suffer.• negatively correlated 
variables  Variables having a 
tendency to move in opposite directions.
• mutual fund  Organization 
that pools funds of individual investors to buy a large number of different stocks or other financial assets.
• positively correlated 
variables  Variables having a 
tendency to move in the same direction.TABLE 5.5 INCOME FROM SALES OF APPLIANCES ($)

Air conditioner sales 30,000 12,000
Heater sales 12,000 30,000172  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
Why? The answer is implicit in our discussion of risk aversion. Buying insur-
ance assures a person of having the same income whether or not there is a loss. Because the insurance cost is equal to the expected loss, this certain income is equal to the expected income from the risky situation. For a risk-averse con-sumer, the guarantee of the same income regardless of the outcome generates more utility than would be the case if that person had a high income when there was no loss and a low income when a loss occurred.
To clarify this point, let’s suppose a homeowner faces a 10-percent probabil-
ity that his house will be burglarized and he will suffer a $10,000 loss. Let’s assume he has $50,000 worth of property. Table 5.6 shows his wealth in two situ-ations—with insurance costing $1000 and without insurance.
Note that expected wealth is the same ($49,000) in both situations. The vari-
ability, however, is quite different. As the table shows, with no insurance the standard deviation of wealth is $3000; with insurance, it is 0. If there is no burglary, the uninsured homeowner gains $1000 relative to the insured hom-eowner. But with a burglary, the uninsured homeowner loses $9000 relative to the insured homeowner. Remember: for a risk-averse individual, losses count more (in terms of changes in utility) than gains. A risk-averse homeowner, there-fore, will enjoy higher utility by purchasing insurance.
THE LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS  Consumers usually buy insurance from 
companies that specialize in selling it. Insurance companies are firms that offer insurance because they know that when they sell a large number of poli-cies, they face relatively little risk. The ability to avoid risk by operating on a large scale is based on the law of large numbers , which tells us that although 
single events may be random and largely unpredictable, the average outcome of many similar events can be predicted. For example, I may not be able to predict whether a coin toss will come out heads or tails, but I know that when many coins are flipped, approximately half will turn up heads and half tails. Likewise, if I am selling automobile insurance, I cannot predict whether a particular driver will have an accident, but I can be reasonably sure, judg-ing from past experience, what fraction of a large group of drivers will have accidents.
ACTUARIAL FAIRNESS  By operating on a large scale, insurance companies 
can be sure that over a sufficiently large number of events, total premiums paid in will be equal to the total amount of money paid out. Let’s return to our burglary example. A man knows that there is a 10-percent probability that his house will be burgled; if it is, he will suffer a $10,000 loss. Prior to facing this risk, he calculates the expected loss to be $1000 (.10 /H11003 $10,000). The risk 
involved is considerable, however, because there is a 10-percent probability of

a large loss. Now suppose that 100 people are similarly situated and that all of 
them buy burglary insurance from the same company. Because they all face a 10-percent probability of a $10,000 loss, the insurance company might charge each of them a premium of $1000. This $1000 premium generates an insurance fund of $100,000 from which losses can be paid. The insurance company can rely on the law of large numbers, which holds that the expected loss to the 100 individuals as a whole is likely to be very close to $1000 each. The total payout, therefore, will be close to $100,000, and the company need not worry about los-ing more than that.
When the insurance premium is equal to the expected payout, as in the exam-
ple above, we say that the insurance is actuarially fair.  But because they must 
cover administrative costs and make some profit, insurance companies typi-cally charge premiums above  expected losses. If there are a sufficient number of 
insurance companies to make the market competitive, these premiums will be close to actuarially fair levels. In some states, however, insurance premiums are regulated in order to protect consumers from “excessive” premiums. We will examine government regulation of markets in detail in Chapters 9 and 10 of this book.
In recent years, some insurance companies have come to the view that cat-
astrophic disasters such as earthquakes are so unique and unpredictable that they cannot be viewed as diversifiable risks. Indeed, as a result of losses from past disasters, these companies do not feel that they can determine actuarially fair insurance rates. In California, for example, the state itself has had to enter the insurance business to fill the gap created when private companies refused to sell earthquake insurance. The state-run pool offers less insurance coverage at higher rates than was previously offered by private insurers.

EXAMPLE 5.3  THE VALUE OF TITLE INSURANCE WHEN BUYING A HOUSE
Suppose you are buying your 
first house. To close the sale, you will need a deed that gives you clear “title.” Without such a clear title, there is always a chance that the seller of the house is not its true owner. Of course, the seller could be engaging in fraud, but it is more likely that the seller is unaware of the exact nature of his or her ownership rights. For example, the owner may have borrowed heavily, using the house as “collateral” for a loan. Or the property might carry with it a legal requirement that limits the use to which it may be put.
Suppose you are willing to pay $300,000 for 
the house, but you believe there is a one-in-twenty chance that careful research will reveal that the seller does not actually own the property. The property would then be worth nothing. If 
there were no insurance available, a risk-neutral person would bid at most $285,000 for the property (.95[$300,000] + .05[0]). However, if you expect to tie up most of your assets in the house, you would probably be risk averse and, there-fore, bid much less—say, $230,000.
In situations such as this, it is clearly in the inter-
est of the buyer to be sure that there is no risk of a lack of full ownership. The buyer does this by pur-chasing “title insurance.” The title insurance com-pany researches the history of the property, checks to see whether any legal liabilities are attached to it, and generally assures itself that there is no ownership problem. The insurance company then agrees to bear any remaining risk that might exist.
174  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
Because the title insurance company is a spe-
cialist in such insurance and can collect the rel-evant information relatively easily, the cost of title insurance is often less than the expected value of the loss involved. A fee of $1500 for title insur-ance is not unusual, even though the expected loss can be much higher. It is also in the inter-est of sellers to provide title insurance, because all but the most risk-loving buyers will pay much 
more for a house when it is insured than when it is not. In fact, most states require sellers to provide title insurance before a sale can be completed. In addition, because mortgage lenders are all concerned about such risks, they usually require new buyers to have title insurance before issuing a mortgage.
The Value of Information
People often make decisions based on limited information. If more information were available, one could make better predictions and reduce risk. Because infor-mation is a valuable commodity, people will pay for it. The value of  complete 
information  is the difference between the expected value of a choice when there 
is complete information and the expected value when information is incomplete.
To see how information can be valuable, suppose you manage a clothing store 
and must decide how many suits to order for the fall season. If you order 100 suits, your cost is $180 per suit. If you order only 50 suits, your cost increases to $200. You know that you will be selling suits for $300 each, but you are not sure how many you can sell. All suits not sold can be returned, but for only half of what you paid for them. Without additional information, you will act on your belief that there is a .5 probability that you will sell 100 suits and a .5 probability that you will sell 50. Table 5.7 gives the profit that you would earn in each of these two cases.
Without additional information, you would choose to buy 100 suits if you 
were risk neutral, taking the chance that your profit might be either $12,000 or $1500. But if you were risk averse, you might buy 50 suits: In that case, you would know for sure that your profit would be $5000.
With complete information, you can place the correct order regardless of 
future sales. If sales were going to be 50 and you ordered 50 suits, your prof-its would be $5000. If, on the other hand, sales were going to be 100 and you ordered 100 suits, your profits would be $12,000. Because both outcomes are equally likely, your expected profit with complete information would be $8500. The value of information is computed as
 Expected value with complete information:  $8500
Less: Expected value with uncertainty (buy 100 suits): -6750
Equals: Value of complete information $1750
Thus it is worth paying up to $1750 to obtain an accurate prediction of sales. 
Even though forecasting is inevitably imperfect, it may be worth investing in a marketing study that provides a reasonable forecast of next year’s sales.• value of complete

between the expected value of a choice when there is complete information and the expected value when information is incomplete.

EXAMPLE 5.4  THE VALUE OF INFORMATION IN AN ONLINE CONSUMER 
ELECTRONICS MARKET
Internet-based price comparison sites offer a valu-
able informational resource to consumers, as shown by a study of a leading price-comparison website, Shopper.com. Researchers studied price informa-tion provided to consumers on over 1,000 top-selling electronics products for an 8-month period. They found that consumers saved about 16% when using this website versus shopping in the store, because the website significantly reduced the cost of finding the lowest priced product.
8
The value of price comparison information is 
not the same for everyone and for every prod-uct. Competition matters. The study found that when only two firms list prices on Shopper.com, consumers save 11%. But the savings increase with 
the number of competitors, jumping to 20% when more than 30 companies list prices.
One might think that the Internet will generate so 
much information about prices that only the lowest-price products will be sold in the long run, causing the value of such information to eventually decline to zero. So far, this has not been the case. There are fixed costs for parties to both transmit and to acquire information over the Internet. These include the costs of maintaining servers and the fees that sites such as Shopper.com charge to list prices at their sites. The result is that prices are likely to continue to vary widely as the Internet continues to grow and mature.
EXAMPLE 5.5  DOCTORS, PATIENTS, AND THE VALUE OF INFORMATION
Suppose you were seriously ill and required major surgery. Assuming you wanted to get the best care possible, how would you go about choosing a surgeon and a hospital to provide that care? Many people would ask their friends or their primary-care physician for a recommendation. Although this might be helpful, a truly informed decision would probably require more detailed information. For example, how success-ful has a recommended surgeon and her affiliated hospital been in performing the particular operation that you need? How many of her patients have died or had serious complications from the operation, and how do these numbers compare with those for other surgeons and hospitals? This kind of information is likely to be difficult or impossible for most patients to obtain. Would patients be better off if detailed information about the performance records of doctors and hospitals were readily available?Not necessarily. More informa-
tion is often, but not always, better. Interestingly in this case, access to per-formance information could actually lead to worse health outcomes. Why? Because access to such information would create two different incentives that would affect the behavior of both doctors and patients. First, it would allow patients to choose doctors with better performance records, which cre-ates an incentive for doctors to perform better. That is a good thing. But sec-
ond, it would encourage doctors to limit their prac-tices to patients who are in relatively good health. The reason is that very old or very sick patients are more likely to have complications or die as a result of treatment; doctors who treat such patients are likely to have worse performance records (other fac-tors being equal). To the extent that doctors would be judged according to performance, they would You might think that more information is always a good thing. As the follow-
ing example shows, however, that is not always the case.

*5.4 The Demand for Risky Assets
Most people are risk averse. Given a choice, they prefer fixed monthly incomes 
to those which, though equally large on average, fluctuate randomly from month to month. Yet many of these same people will invest all or part of their savings in stocks, bonds, and other assets that carry some risk. Why do risk-averse people invest in the stock market and thereby risk losing part or all of their investments?
10 How do people decide how much risk to bear when making 
investments and planning for the future? To answer these questions, we must examine the demand for risky assets.
Assets
An asset  is something that provides a flow of money or services to its owner.  A home, 
an apartment building, a savings account, or shares of General Motors stock are all assets. A home, for example, provides a flow of housing services to its owner, and, if the owner did not wish to live there, could be rented out, thereby provid-ing a monetary flow. Likewise, apartments can be rented out, providing a flow of rental income to the owner of the building. A savings account pays interest (usually every day or every month), which is usually reinvested in the account.• asset  Something that 
provides a flow of money or services to its owner.have an incentive to avoid treating very old or sick 
patients. As a result, such patients would find it dif-ficult or impossible to obtain treatment.
Whether more information is better depends on 
which effect dominates—the ability of patients to make more informed choices versus the incentive for doctors to avoid very sick patients. In a recent study, economists examined the impact of the mandatory “report cards” introduced in New York and Pennsylvania in the early 1990s to  evaluate 
outcomes of coronary bypass surgeries.
9 They 
analyzed hospital choices and outcomes for all elderly heart attack patients and patients receiv-ing coronary bypass surgery in the United States from 1987 through 1994. By comparing trends in New York and Pennsylvania to the trends in other states, they could determine the effect of the increased information made possible by the avail-ability of report cards. They found that although report cards improved matching of patients with hospitals and doctors, they also caused a shift in 
treatment from sicker patients towards healthier ones. Overall, this led to worse outcomes, espe-cially among sicker patients. Thus the study con-cluded that report cards reduced welfare.
The medical profession has responded to this 
problem to some extent. For example, in 2010, car-diac surgery programs across the country voluntarily reported the results of coronary-artery bypass graft-ing procedures. Each program was rated with one to three stars, but this time the ratings were “risk adjusted” to reduce the incentive for doctors to choose less risky patients.
More information often improves welfare because 
it allows people to reduce risk and to take actions that might reduce the effect of bad outcomes. However, as this example makes clear, informa-tion can cause people to change their behavior in undesirable ways. We will discuss this issue further in Chapter 17.

10Most Americans have at least some money invested in stocks or other risky assets, though often 
indirectly. For example, many people who hold full-time jobs have shares in pension funds under-written in part by their own salary contributions and in part by employer contributions. Usually such funds are partly invested in the stock market.CHAPTER 5   •  Uncertainty and Consumer Behavior  177
The monetary flow that one receives from asset ownership can take the form 
of an explicit payment, such as the rental income from an apartment build-ing: Every month, the landlord receives rent checks from the tenants. Another form of explicit payment is the dividend on shares of common stock: Every three months, the owner of a share of General Motors stock receives a quarterly  dividend payment.
But sometimes the monetary flow from ownership of an asset is implicit: It 
takes the form of an increase or decrease in the price or value of the asset. An increase in the value of an asset is a capital gain ; a decrease is a capital loss.  For 
example, as the population of a city grows, the value of an apartment building may increase. The owner of the building will then earn a capital gain beyond the rental income. The capital gain is unrealized  until the building is sold because 
no money is actually received until then. There is, however, an implicit mon-etary flow because the building could  be sold at any time. The monetary flow 
from owning General Motors stock is also partly implicit. The price of the stock changes from day to day, and each time it does, owners gain or lose.
Risky and Riskless Assets
A risky asset  provides a monetary flow that is at least in part random.  In other words, 
the monetary flow is not known with certainty in advance. A share of General Motors stock is an obvious example of a risky asset: You cannot know whether the price of the stock will rise or fall over time, nor can you even be sure that the company will continue to pay the same (or any) dividend per share. Although people often associate risk with the stock market, most other assets are also risky.
An apartment building is one example. You cannot know how much land 
values will rise or fall, whether the building will be fully rented all the time, or even whether the tenants will pay their rents promptly. Corporate bonds are another example—the issuing corporation could go bankrupt and fail to pay bond owners their interest and principal. Even long-term U.S. gov-ernment bonds that mature in 10 or 20 years are risky. Although it is highly unlikely that the federal government will go bankrupt, the rate of inflation could unexpectedly increase and make future interest payments and the eventual repayment of principal worth less in real terms, thereby reducing the value of the bonds.
In contrast, a riskless (or risk-free) asset  pays a monetary flow that is known 
with certainty. Short-term U.S. government bonds—called Treasury bills—are riskless, or almost riskless. Because they mature in a few months, there is very little risk from an unexpected increase in the rate of inflation. You can also be reasonably confident that the U.S. government will not default on the bond (i.e., refuse to pay back the holder when the bond comes due). Other examples of riskless or almost riskless assets include passbook savings accounts and short-term certificates of deposit.
Asset Returns
People buy and hold assets because of the monetary flows they provide. To compare assets with each other, it helps to think of this monetary flow relative to an asset’s price or value. The return  on an asset is the total monetary flow it 
yields—including capital gains or losses—as a fraction of its price.  For example, a bond 
worth $1000 today that pays out $100 this year (and every year) has a return of • risky asset  Asset that 
provides an uncertain flow of money or services to its owner.
• riskless ( or risk-free) 
asset  Asset that provides a 
flow of money or services that is known with certainty.
• return  Total monetary flow 
of an asset as a fraction of its price.178  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
10 percent.11 If an apartment building was worth $10 million last year, increased 
in value to $11 million this year, and also provided rental income (after expenses) of $0.5 million, it would have yielded a return of 15 percent over the past year. If a share of General Motors stock was worth $80 at the beginning of the year, fell to $72 by the end of the year, and paid a dividend of $4, it will have yielded a return of -5 percent (the dividend yield of 5 percent less the capital loss of 10 percent).
When people invest their savings in stocks, bonds, land, or other assets, they 
usually hope to earn a return that exceeds the rate of inflation. Thus, by delay-ing consumption, they can buy more in the future than they can by spending all their income now. Consequently, we often express the return on an asset in real—i.e., inflation-adjusted —terms. The real return  on an asset is its simple (or 
nominal) return less the rate of inflation. For example, with an annual inflation 
rate of 5 percent, our bond, apartment building, and share of GM stock have yielded real returns of 5 percent, 10 percent, and −10 percent, respectively.
EXPECTED VERSUS ACTUAL RETURNS  Because most assets are risky, an 
investor cannot know in advance what returns they will yield over the com-ing year. For example, our apartment building might have depreciated in value instead of appreciating, and the price of GM stock might have risen instead of fallen. However, we can still compare assets by looking at their expected returns. The expected return  on an asset is the expected value of its return , i.e., the return 
that it should earn on average. In some years, an asset’s actual return  may be 
much higher than its expected return and in some years much lower. Over a long period, however, the average return should be close to the expected return.
Different assets have different expected returns. Table 5.8, for example, shows 
that while the expected real return of a U.S. Treasury bill has been less than 1 percent, the expected real return on a group of representative stocks on the New York Stock Exchange has been more than 9 percent.
12 Why would anyone buy 
a Treasury bill when the expected return on stocks is so much higher? Because the demand for an asset depends not just on its expected return, but also on its risk: Although stocks have a higher expected return than Treasury bills, they 
also carry much more risk. One measure of risk, the standard deviation of the real annual return, is equal to 20.4 percent for common stocks, 8.3 percent for corporate bonds, and only 3.1 percent for U.S. Treasury bills.
The numbers in Table 5.8 suggest that the higher the expected return on an 
investment, the greater the risk involved. Assuming that one’s investments are well diversified, this is indeed the case.
13 As a result, the risk-averse investor 
must balance expected return against risk. We examine this trade-off in more detail in the next section.• real return  Simple (or 
nominal) return on an asset, less the rate of inflation.
• expected return  Return 
that an asset should earn on average.
• actual return  Return that an 
asset earns.
11The price of a bond often changes during the course of a year. If the bond appreciates (or depreci-
ates) in value during the year, its return will be greater (or less) than 10 percent. In addition, the definition of return  given above should not be confused with the “internal rate of return,” which 
is sometimes used to compare monetary flows occurring over a period of time. We discuss other return measures in Chapter 15, when we deal with present discounted values.
12For some stocks, the expected return is higher, and for some it is lower. Stocks of smaller compa-
nies (e.g., some of those traded on the NASDAQ) have higher expected rates of return—and higher return standard deviations.
13It is nondiversifiable  risk that matters. An individual stock may be very risky but still have a low 
expected return because most of the risk could be diversified away by holding a large number of 
such stocks. Nondiversifiable risk , which arises from the fact that individual stock prices are correlated 
with the overall stock market, is the risk that remains even if one holds a diversified portfolio of stocks. We discuss this point in detail in the context of the capital asset pricing model  in Chapter 15.CHAPTER 5   •  Uncertainty and Consumer Behavior  179
The Trade-Off Between Risk and Return
Suppose a woman wants to invest her savings in two assets—Treasury bills, 
which are almost risk free, and a representative group of stocks. She must decide how much to invest in each asset. She might, for instance, invest only in Treasury bills, only in stocks, or in some combination of the two. As we will see, this problem is analogous to the consumer’s problem of allocating a budget between purchases of food and clothing.
Let’s denote the risk-free return on the Treasury bill by R
f. Because the 
return is risk free, the expected and actual returns are the same. In addi-tion, let the expected  return from investing in the stock market be R
m and the 
actual return be rm. The actual return is risky. At the time of the investment 
decision, we know the set of possible outcomes and the likelihood of each, but we do not know what particular outcome will occur. The risky asset will have a higher expected return than the risk-free asset ( R
m 7 Rf). Otherwise, 
risk-averse investors would buy only Treasury bills and no stocks would  be sold.
THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO  To determine how much money the investor 
should put in each asset, let’s set b equal to the fraction of her savings placed 
in the stock market and (1 - b) the fraction used to purchase Treasury bills. The 
expected return on her total portfolio, R
p, is a weighted average of the expected 
return on the two assets:14
 Rp=bRm+(1-b)Rf (5.1)
Suppose, for example, that Treasury bills pay 4 percent ( Rf /H11005 .04), the stock 
market’s expected return is 12 percent ( Rm /H11005 .12), and b /H11005 1/2. Then Rp /H11005 8 
percent. How risky is this portfolio? One measure of riskiness is the standard deviation of its return. We will denote the standard deviation  of the risky stock 
market investment by /H9268
m. With some algebra, we can show that the standard 
deviation of the portfolio , /H9268p (with one risky and one risk-free asset) is the  fraction TABLE 5.8 INVESTMENTS—RISK AND RETURN (1926–2010)

asset:15
 sp=bsm (5.2)
The Investor’s Choice Problem
We have still not determined how the investor should choose this fraction b. To 
do so, we must first show that she faces a risk-return trade-off analogous to a consumer’s budget line. To identify this trade-off, note that equation (5.1) for the expected return on the portfolio can be rewritten as
R
p=Rf+b(Rm-Rf)
Now, from equation (5.2) we see that b /H11005 /H9268p//H9268m, so that
 Rp=Rf+(Rm-Rf)
sm sp (5.3)
RISK AND THE BUDGET LINE  This equation is a budget line  because it describes 
the trade-off between risk ( /H9268p) and expected return ( Rp). Note that it is the equa-
tion for a straight line: Because Rm, Rf, and /H9268m are constants, the slope ( Rm − Rf)/
/H9268m is a constant, as is the intercept, Rf. The equation says that the expected return 
on the portfolio Rp increases as the standard deviation of that return  /H9268p increases.  We 
call the slope of this budget line, ( Rm − Rf)//H9268m, the price of risk,  because it tells us 
how much extra risk an investor must incur to enjoy a higher expected return.
The budget line is drawn in Figure 5.6. If our investor wants no risk, she 
can invest all her funds in Treasury bills ( b /H11005 0) and earn an expected return 
Rf. To receive a higher expected return, she must incur some risk. For example, 
she could invest all her funds in stocks ( b /H11005 1), earning an expected return Rm 
but incurring a standard deviation /H9268m. Or she might invest some fraction of her 
funds in each type of asset, earning an expected return somewhere between Rf 
and Rm and facing a standard deviation less than /H9268m but greater than zero.
RISK AND INDIFFERENCE CURVES  Figure 5.6 also shows the solution to the 
investor’s problem. Three indifference curves are drawn in the figure. Each curve describes combinations of risk and return that leave the investor equally satisfied. The curves are upward-sloping because risk is undesirable. Thus, with a greater amount of risk, it takes a greater expected return to make the investor equally well-off. Curve U
3 yields the greatest amount of satisfaction and U1 the 
least amount: For a given amount of risk, the investor earns a higher expected return on U
3 than on U2 and a higher expected return on U2 than on U1.In §3.2 we explain how a 
budget line is determined from an individual’s income and the prices of the avail-able goods.
• Price of risk
 Extra risk that 
an investor must incur to enjoy a higher expected return.
15To see why, we observe from footnote 4 that we can write the variance of the portfolio return as
s p2=E[brm+(1-b)Rf-Rp]2
Substituting equation (5.1) for the expected return on the portfolio, Rp, we have
s p2=E[brm+(1-b)Rf-bRm-(1-b)Rf]2=E[b(rm-Rm)]2=b2s m2
Because the standard deviation of a random variable is the square root of its variance, sp=bsm.CHAPTER 5   •  Uncertainty and Consumer Behavior  181
Of the three indifference curves, the investor would prefer to be on U3. This 
position, however, is not feasible, because U3 does not touch the budget line. 
Curve U1 is feasible, but the investor can do better. Like the consumer choosing 
quantities of food and clothing, our investor does best by choosing a combina-tion of risk and return at the point where an indifference curve (in this case U
2) 
is tangent to the budget line. At that point, the investor’s return has an expected value R* and a standard deviation /H9268*.
Naturally, people differ in their attitudes toward risk. This fact is illustrated 
in Figure 5.7, which shows how two different investors choose their portfolios. Investor A is quite risk averse. Because his indifference curve U
A is tangent to 
the budget line at a point of low risk, he will invest almost all of his funds in Treasury bills and earn an expected return R
A just slightly larger than the risk-
free return Rf. Investor B is less risk averse. She will invest most of her funds in 
stocks, and while the return on her portfolio will have a higher expected value R
B, it will also have a higher standard deviation /H9268B.
If Investor B has a sufficiently low level of risk aversion, she might buy stocks 
on margin : that is, she would borrow money from a brokerage firm in order U3

CHOOSING BETWEEN RISK AND RETURN
An investor is dividing her funds between two assets—Treasury bills, which are risk free, 
and stocks. The budget line describes the trade-off between the expected return and its riskiness, as measured by the standard deviation of the return. The slope of the bud-get line is ( R
m− R f)//H9268m, which is the price of risk. Three indifference curves are drawn, 
each showing combinations of risk and return that leave an investor equally satisfied. The curves are upward-sloping because a risk-averse investor will require a higher ex-pected return if she is to bear a greater amount of risk. The utility-maximizing invest-ment portfolio is at the point where indifference curve U
2 is tangent to the budget line.182  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
to invest more than she actually owns in the stock market. In effect, a person 
who buys stocks on margin holds a portfolio with more than 100 percent of the portfolio’s value invested in stocks. This situation is illustrated in Figure 5.8, which shows indifference curves for two investors. Investor A, who is  relatively 
risk-averse, invests about half of his funds in stocks. Investor B, however, has 
an indifference curve that is relatively flat and tangent with the budget line at Expected

Because Investor A is risk averse, his 
portfolio contains a mixture of stocks and risk-free Treasury bills. Investor B, 
however, has a very low degree of risk aversion. Her indifference curve, U
B, is 
tangent to the budget line at a point where the expected return and stan-dard deviation for her portfolio exceed those for the stock market overall. This implies that she would like to invest more  than 100 percent of her wealth 
in the stock market. She does so by buying stocks on margin —i.e., by bor-
rowing from a brokerage firm to help finance her investment.CHAPTER 5   •  Uncertainty and Consumer Behavior  183
EXAMPLE 5.6  INVESTING IN THE STOCK MARKET
The 1990s witnessed a shift in the 
investing behavior of Americans. First, many people started investing in the stock market for the first time. In 1989, about 32 percent of families in the United States had part of their wealth invested in the stock market, either directly (by owning indi-vidual stocks) or indirectly (through mutual funds or pension plans invested in stocks). By 1998, that fraction had risen to 49 percent. In addition, the share of wealth invested in stocks increased from about 26 percent to about 54 percent during the same period.
17 Much of this shift is attributable 
to younger investors. For those under the age of 35, participation in the stock market increased from about 22 percent in 1989 to about 41 per-cent in 1998. In most respects, household invest-ing behavior has stabilized after the 1990s shift. The percent of families with investments in the stock market was 51.1% in 2007. However, older Americans have become much more active. By 2007, 40 percent of people over 
age 75 held stocks, up from 29 percent in 1998.
Why have more people started 
investing in the stock market? One reason is the advent of online trading, which has made investing much easier. Another reason may be the consider-
able increase in stock prices that occurred dur-ing the late 1990s, driven in part by the so-called “dot com euphoria.” These increases may have convinced some investors that prices could only continue to rise in the future. As one analyst put it, “The market’s relentless seven-year climb, the popularity of mutual funds, the shift by employ-ers to self-directed retirement plans, and the ava-lanche of do-it-yourself investment publications all have combined to create a nation of financial know-it-alls.”
18
Figure 5.9 shows the dividend yield and price/
earnings (P/E) ratio for the S&P 500 (an index of stocks of 500 large corporations) over the period 
a point where the expected return on the portfolio exceeds the expected return on the stock market. In order to hold this portfolio, the investor must borrow money because she wants to invest more  than 100 percent of her wealth in the 
stock market. Buying stocks on margin in this way is a form of leverage : the 
investor increases her expected return above that for the overall stock market, but at the cost of increased risk.
In Chapters 3 and 4, we simplified the problem of consumer choice by 
assuming that the consumer had only two goods from which to choose—food and clothing. In the same spirit, we have simplified the investor’s choice by limiting it to Treasury bills and stocks. The basic principles, how-ever, would be the same if we had more assets (e.g., corporate bonds, land, and different types of stocks). Every investor faces a trade-off between risk and return.
16 The degree of extra risk that each is willing to bear in order to 
earn a higher expected return depends on how risk averse he or she is. Less risk-averse investors tend to include a larger fraction of risky assets in their portfolios.
16As mentioned earlier, what matters is nondiversifiable risk, because investors can eliminate diver-
sifiable risk by holding many different stocks (e.g., via mutual funds). We discuss diversifiable versus nondiversifiable risk in Chapter 15.

1970 to 2011. Observe that the dividend yield 
(the annual dividend divided by the stock price) fell from about 5 percent in 1980 to below 2 per-cent by 2000. Meanwhile, however, the price/earnings ratio (the share price divided by annual earnings per share) increased from about 8 in 1980 to over 40 in 2002, before falling to around 20 between 2005 and 2007 and then increasing through 2011. In retrospect, the increase in the P/E ratio could only have occurred if investors believed that  corporate profits would  continue 
to grow rapidly in the coming decade. This sug-gests that in the late 1990s, many investors had a low degree of risk aversion, were quite optimistic about the economy, or both. Alternatively, some economists have argued that the run-up of stock prices during the 1990s was the result of “herd 
behavior,” in which investors rushed to get into the market after hearing of the successful experi-ences of others.
19
The psychological motivations that explain herd 
behavior can help to explain stock market bubbles. However, they go far beyond the stock market. They also apply to the behavior of consumers and firm managers in a wide variety of settings. Such behavior cannot always be captured by the simpli-fied assumptions that we have made up to this point about consumer choice. In the next section, we will discuss these aspects of behavior in detail, and we will see how the traditional models of Chapters 3 and 4 can be expanded to help us understand this behavior.P /E RatioDividend Yield

5.5  Bubbles
During 1995 to 2000, the stock prices of many Internet companies rose 
sharply. What was behind these sharp price increases? One could argue—as many stock analysts, investment advisors, and ordinary investors did at the time—that these price increases were justified by fundamentals. Many peo-ple thought that the Internet’s potential was virtually unbounded, particu-larly as high-speed Internet access became more widely available. After all, more and more goods and services were being bought online through com-panies such as Amazon.com, Craigslist.org, Ticketmaster.com, Fandango.com, and a host of others. In addition, more and more people began to read the news online rather than buying physical newspapers and magazines, and more and more information became available online through sources like Google, Bing, Wikipedia, and WebMD. And as a result, companies began to shift more and more of their advertising from newspapers and television to the Internet.
Yes, the Internet has certainly changed the way most of us live. (In fact, some 
of you may be reading the electronic version of this book, which you down-loaded from the Pearson website and hopefully paid for!) But does that mean that any company with a name that ends in “.com” is sure to make high profits in the future? Probably not. And yet many investors (perhaps “speculators” is a better word) bought the stocks of Internet companies at very high prices, prices that were increasingly difficult to justify based on fundamentals, i.e., based on rational projections of future profitability. The result was the Internet bubble,  
an increase in the prices of Internet stocks based not on the fundamentals of  business profitability, but instead on the belief that the prices of those stocks would keep going up. The bubble burst when people started to realize that the profitability of these companies was far from a sure thing, and that prices that go up can also come down.
Bubbles are often the result of irrational behavior. People stop thinking 
straight. They buy something because the price has been going up, and they believe (perhaps encouraged by their friends) that the price will keep going up, so that making a profit is a sure thing. If you ask these people whether the price might at some point drop, they typically will answer “Yes, but I will sell before the price drops.” And if you push them further by asking how they will know when the price is about to drop, the answer might be “I’ll just know.” But, of course, most of the time they won’t know; they will sell after the price has dropped, and they will lose at least part of their investment. (There might be a silver lining—perhaps they will learn some economics from the experience.)
Bubbles are often harmless in the sense that while people lose money, there 
is no lasting damage to the overall economy. But that is not always the case. The United States experienced a prolonged housing price bubble that burst in 2008, causing financial losses to large banks that had sold mortgages to home buyers who could not afford to make their monthly payments (but thought housing prices would keep rising). Some of these banks were given large gov-ernment bailouts to keep them from going bankrupt, but many homeowners were less fortunate, and facing foreclosure, they lost their homes. By the end of 2008, the United States was in its worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The housing price bubble, far from harmless, was partly to blame for this.
• bubble  An increase in the 
price of a good based not on the fundamentals of demand or value, but instead on a belief that the price will keep going up.
Recall from Section 4.3 that speculative demand  is 
driven not by the direct ben-efits one obtains from own-ing or consuming a good but instead is driven by an expectation that the price of the good will increase.186  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
20The S&P/Case-Shiller index measures the change in housing prices by tracking repeat sales of 
single family homes in 20 cities across the United States. By comparing a home’s original sale price with its price in subsequent sales, the index is able to control for other variables (i.e., size, location, style) that might also lead to rising home prices.EXAMPLE 5.7  THE HOUSING PRICE BUBBLE (I)
Starting around 1998, U.S. hous-
ing prices began rising sharply. Figure 5.10 shows the S&P/Case-Shiller housing price index at the national level.
20 From 1987 (when 
the Index was first published) to 1998, the index rose around 3 per-cent per year in nominal terms. (In real terms, i.e., net of inflation, the index dropped about 0.5 percent per year.) This was a normal rate of price increase, roughly com-mensurate with population and income growth and with inflation. But then prices started rising much more rapidly, with the index increasing about 10 percent per year until it reached its peak of 190 in 2006. During that 8-year period from 1998 to 2006, many people bought into the 
myth that housing was a sure-fire investment, and that prices could only keep going up. Many banks also bought into this myth and offered mortgages to people with incomes well below what it would take to make the monthly inter-est and principal payments over 
the long term. The demand for housing increased sharply, with some people buying four or five houses under the assumption that they could “flip” them in a year and make a quick profit. This specu-lative demand served to push prices up further.
However, in 2006 something funny happened. 
Prices stopped going up. In fact, during 2006, prices

Informational Cascades
Suppose you are considering investing in the stock of Ajax Corp., which is 
trading at $20 per share. Ajax is a biotech company that is working on a radi-cally new approach to the treatment of chronic boredom (a disease that often afflicts  students of economics). You find it difficult to evaluate the company’s prospects, but $20 seems like a reasonable price. But now you see the price is increasing—to $21, $22, then a jump to $25 per share. In fact, some friends of yours have just bought in at $25. Now the price reaches $30. Other investors must know something. Perhaps they consulted biochemists who can better evaluate the  company’s prospects. So you decide to buy the stock at $30. You believe that positive information drove the actions of other investors, and you acted accordingly.
Was buying the stock of Ajax at $30 a rational decision, or were you  simply 
buying into a bubble? It might indeed be rational. After all, it is reasonable to expect that other investors tried to value the company as best they could and that their analyses might have been more thorough or better informed than yours. Thus the actions of other investors could well be informative and lead you to rationally adjust your own valuation of the company.
Note that in this example, your investment decisions are based not on funda-
mental information that you have obtained (e.g., regarding the likelihood that Ajax’s R&D will be successful), but rather on the investment decisions of  others. And note that you are implicitly assuming that: (i) these investment decisions of others are based on fundamental information that they have obtained; or (ii) these 
investment decisions of others are based on the investment decisions of others still, which are based on fundamental information that they have obtained; or 
(iii) these investment decisions of others are based on the investment decisions of others still, which in turn are based on the investment  decisions of still more others, which are based on fundamental information that they obtained; or ...  
etc., etc. You get the idea. Maybe the “others” at the end of the chain based their investment decisions on weak information that was no more informative than the information you started with when you began thinking about Ajax. In other actually fell slightly (about 2 percent in  nominal terms). 
Then, in 2007 prices started falling rapidly, and by 2008 it had become clear that the great housing boom was just a bubble, and the bubble had burst. From its peak in early 2006 through 2011, housing prices fell by over 33 percent in nominal terms. (In real terms they fell by nearly 40% percent.) And this drop is an average for the United States as a whole. In some states, such as Florida, Arizona, and Nevada, the bubble was far worse, with prices dropping by over 50 percent.
The United States was not the only country to 
experience a housing price bubble. More or less the same thing happened in Europe. In Ireland, for example, a booming economy and increasing  foreign 
investment—along with widespread speculation—pushed housing prices up 305% between 1995 and 2007 (641% between 1987 and 2007—both in  
nominal terms). After over a decade of above  average 
growth, Ireland’s bubble burst. By 2010, housing prices had fallen over 28% from their 2007 peak. Spain and other European countries suffered similar fates, contributing to a worldwide debt crisis. Other appar-ent bubbles have yet to deflate. Many Chinese cities, including Shanghai and Beijing, have seen  rapidly ris-
ing housing and land prices, with some apartments reportedly doubling in value in mere months.

21Fearing a sudden collapse, the Chinese government took steps to curtail skyrocketing housing 
prices, tightening lending requirements and requiring purchasers to put more money down.

EXAMPLE 5.8  THE HOUSING PRICE BUBBLE (II)
Informational cascades may help to 
explain the housing bubbles that occurred in the U.S. and other coun-tries. For example, from 1999 to 2006, home prices in Miami nearly tripled. Would it have been com-pletely irrational to buy real estate in Miami in 2006? In the years prior to 2006, some analysts projected large increases in the demand for housing in Miami and other parts of Florida, based in part on a growing number of aging retirees that want to move to someplace warm, and in part on an influx of immigrants with family or other roots in Miami. If other inves-tors acted on the belief that these analysts had done their homework, investing might have been rational.Informational cascades may also help 
explain the housing bubbles that took place in other parts of the U.S., notably Arizona, Nevada, and California. (See Figure 5.11.) There, too, some analysts had projected large increases in demand. On the other hand, few analysts pro-jected large demand increases in cities like Cleveland (not exactly a retirement paradise), and indeed such cities experi-enced little in the way of a bubble.
Was it rational to buy real estate in Miami in 
2006? Rational or not, investors should have known that considerable risk was involved in buying real estate there (or elsewhere in Florida, Arizona, Nevada, and California). Looking back, we now know that many of these investors lost their shirts (not to mention their homes).

words, your own investment decisions might be the result of an  informational 
cascade —actions based on actions based on actions . . . , etc., driven by very 
 limited fundamental information.
The bubble that results from an informational cascade can in fact be rational 
in the sense that there is a basis for believing that investing in the bubble will yield a positive return. The reason is that if investors early in the chain indeed obtained positive information and based their decisions on that information, the expected gain to an investor down the chain will be positive.
22 However, the risk 
involved will be considerable, and it is likely that at least some investors will underestimate that risk.
5.6  Behavioral Economics
Recall that the basic theory of consumer demand is based on three assumptions: (1) consumers have clear preferences for some goods over others; (2) consumers face budget constraints; and (3) given their preferences, limited incomes, and the prices of different goods, consumers choose to buy combinations of goods that maximize their satisfaction (or utility). These assumptions, however, are not always realistic: Preferences are not always clear or might vary depending on the context in which choices are made, and consumer choices are not always utility-maximizing.
Perhaps our understanding of consumer demand (as well as the deci-
sions of firms) would be improved if we incorporated more realistic and detailed assumptions regarding human behavior. This has been the objec-tive of the newly flourishing field of behavioral economics , which has broad-
ened and enriched the study of microeconomics.
23 We introduce this topic 
by highlighting some  examples of consumer behavior that cannot be easily explained with the basic utility-maximizing assumptions that we have relied on so far:
• There has just been a big snowstorm, so you stop at the hardware store to buy 
a snow shovel. You had expected to pay $20 for the shovel—the price that the store normally charges. However, you find that the store has suddenly raised the price to $40. Although you would expect a price increase because of the storm, you feel that a doubling of the price is unfair and that the store is trying to take advantage of you. Out of spite, you do not buy the shovel.
24
• Tired of being snowed in at home you decide to take a vacation in the coun-
try. On the way, you stop at a highway restaurant for lunch. Even though you are unlikely to return to that restaurant, you believe that it is fair and • Informational cascade

investment opportunity) based in part on the actions of others, which in turn were based on the actions of others.

Constraint on Profit Seeking: Entitlements in the Market,” American Economic Review  76 (September

 appropriate to leave a 15-percent tip in appreciation of the good service that 
you received.
• You buy this textbook from an Internet bookseller because the price is lower 
than the price at your local bookstore. However, you ignore the shipping cost when comparing prices.
Each of these examples illustrates plausible behavior that cannot be explained 
by a model based solely on the basic assumptions described in Chapters 3 and 4. Instead, we need to draw on insights from psychology and sociology to augment our basic assumptions about consumer behavior. These insights will enable us to account for more complex consumer preferences, for the use of simple rules in decision-making, and for the difficulty that people often have in understand-ing the laws of probability.
Adjustments to the standard model of consumer preferences and demand 
can be grouped into three categories: A tendency to value goods and services in part based on the setting one is in, a concern about the fairness of an economic transaction, and the use of simple rules of thumb as a way to cut through com-plex economic decisions. We examine each of these in turn.
Reference Points and Consumer Preferences
The standard model of consumer behavior assumes that consumers place unique values on the goods and services they purchase. However, psycholo-gists and market research studies have found that perceived value depends in part on the setting in which the purchasing decision occurs. That set-ting creates a reference point  on which preferences might be at least partly 
based.
The reference point—the point from which the individual makes the con-
sumption decision—can strongly affect that decision. Consider, for example, apartment prices in Pittsburgh and San Francisco. In Pittsburgh, the median monthly rent in 2006 for a two-bedroom apartment was about $650, while in San Francisco the rent for a similar apartment was $2,125. For someone accus-tomed to San Francisco housing prices, Pittsburgh might seem like a bargain. On the other hand, someone moving from Pittsburgh to San Francisco might feel “gouged”—thinking it unfair for housing to cost that much.
25 In this exam-
ple, the reference point is clearly different for long-time residents of Pittsburgh and San Francisco.
Reference points can develop for many reasons: our past consumption of 
a good, our experience in a market, our expectation about how prices should behave, and even the context in which we consume a good. Reference points can strongly affect the way people approach economic decisions. Below we describe several different examples of reference points and the way they affect consumer behavior.
ENDOWMENT EFFECT  A well-known example of a reference point is the 
endowment effect —the fact that individuals tend to value an item more when 
they happen to own it than when they do not. One way to think about this effect is to consider the gap between the price that a person is willing to pay for a good and the price at which she is willing to sell the same good to someone else. Our • reference point  The point 
from which an individual makes a consumption decision.
• endowment effect  
Tendency of individuals to value an item more when they own it than when they do not.
25This example is based on Uri Simonsohn and George Loewenstein, “Mistake #37: The Effects of 
Previously Encountered Prices on Current Housing Demand,” The Economic Journal  116 (January 
2006): 175–199.CHAPTER 5   •  Uncertainty and Consumer Behavior  191
basic theory of consumer behavior says that this price should be the same, but 
many experiments suggest that is not what happens in  practice.26
In one classroom experiment, half of the students chosen at random were 
given a free coffee mug with a market value of $5; the other half got nothing.27 
Students with the mug were asked the price at which they would sell it back to the professor; the second group was asked the minimum amount of money that they would accept in lieu of a mug. The decision faced by both groups is simi-lar but their reference points are different. For the first group, whose reference point was possession of a mug, the average selling price was $7. For the second group, which did not have a mug, the average amount desired in lieu of a mug was $3.50. This gap in prices shows that giving up the mug was perceived to be a greater “loss” to those who had one than the “gain” from obtaining a mug for those without one. This is an endowment effect—the mug was worth more to those people who already owned it.
LOSS AVERSION  The coffee mug experiment described above is also an 
example of loss aversion —the tendency of individuals to prefer avoiding 
losses over acquiring gains. The students who owned the mug and believed that its market value was indeed $5 were averse to selling it for less than $5 because doing so would have created a perceived loss. The fact that they had been given the mug for free, and thus would still have had an overall gain, didn’t matter as much.
As another example of loss aversion, people are sometimes hesitant to sell 
stocks at a loss, even if they could invest the proceeds in other stocks that they think are better investments. Why? Because the original price paid for the stock—which turned out to be too high given the realities of the market—acts as a reference point, and people are averse to losses. (A $1000 loss on an investment seems to “hurt” more than the perceived benefit from a $1000 gain.) While there are a variety of circumstances in which endowment effects arise, we now know that these effects tend to disappear as consumers gain relevant experience. We would not expect to see stockbrokers or other investment professionals exhibit the loss aversion described above.
28
FRAMING  Preferences are also influenced by framing,  which is another 
manifestation of reference points. Framing is a tendency to rely on the con-text in which a choice is described when making a decision. How choices are framed—the names they are given, the context in which they are described, and their appearance—can affect the choices that individuals make. Are you more likely to buy a skin cream whose package claims that is will “slow the aging process” or one that is described as “making you feel young again.” These products might be essentially identical except for their packaging. Yet, in the real world where information is sometimes limited and per-
spective matters, many individuals would prefer to buy the product that  emphasizes youth.• loss aversion  Tendency for 
individuals to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring gains.
• framing  Tendency to rely 
on the context in which a choice is described when making a decision.
26Experimental work such as this has been important to the development of behavioral economics. It 
is for this reason that the 2002 Nobel Prize in economics was shared by Vernon Smith, who did much of the pioneering work in the use of experiments to test economic theories.

Fairness
People sometimes do things because they think it is appropriate or fair to do so, 
even though there is no financial or other material benefit. Examples include charitable giving, volunteering time, or tipping in a restaurant. Fairness like-wise affected consumer behavior in our example of buying a snow shovel.
At first glance, our basic consumer theory does not appear to account for fair-
ness. However, we can often modify our models of demand to account for the effects of fairness on consumer behavior. To see how, let’s return to our original snow shovel example. In that example, the market price of shovels was $20, but right after a snowstorm (which caused a shift in the demand curve), stores raised their price to $40. Some consumers, however, felt they were being unfairly gouged, and refused to buy a shovel.
This is illustrated in Figure 5.12. Demand curve D
1 applies during normal 
weather. Stores have been charging $20 for a shovel, and sell a total quantity of Q
1 shovels per month (because many consumers buy shovels in anticipation 
of snow). In fact some people would have been willing to pay much more for a shovel (the upper part of the demand curve), but they don’t have to because the market price is $20. Then the snowstorm hits, and the demand curve shifts to the right. Had the price remained $20, the quantity demanded would have increased to Q
2. But note that the new demand curve ( D2) does not extend up as 
far as the old one. Many consumers might feel that an increase in price to, say, $25 is fair, but an increase much above that would be unfair gouging. Thus the new demand curve becomes very elastic at prices above $25, and no shovels can be sold at a price much above $30.
Note how fairness comes in to play here. In normal weather, some consumers 
would have been willing to pay $30 or even $40 for a shovel. But they know that EXAMPLE 5.9  SELLING A HOUSE
Homeowners sometimes sell their homes because they have to relocate for a new job, because they want to be closer to (or farther from) the city in which they work, or because they want to move to a bigger or smaller house. So they put their home on the mar-ket. But at what price? The owners can usually get a good idea of what the house will sell for by looking at the selling prices of comparable houses, or by talking with a realtor. Often, however, the owners will set an asking price that is well above any realistic expecta-tion of what the house can actually sell for. As a result, the house may stay on the market for many months before the owners grudgingly lower the price. During that time the owners have to continue to maintain the house and pay for taxes, utilities, and insurance. This seems irrational. Why not set an asking price closer to what the  market will bear?
The endowment effect  is at work here. The 
homeowners view their house as special; their ownership has given them what they think is a 
special appreciation of its value—a value that may go beyond any price that the market will bear.
If housing prices have been falling, loss aver-
sion could also be at work. As we saw in Examples 
5.7 and 5.8, U.S and European housing prices started falling around 2008, as the housing bub-ble deflated. As a result, some homeowners were affected by loss aversion when deciding on an ask-ing price, especially if they bought their home at a time near the peak of the bubble. Selling the house turns a paper loss, which may not seem real, into a loss that is real. Averting that reality may serve to explain the reluctance of home owners to take that final step of selling their home. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that houses tend to stay on the market longer during economic downturns than in upturns.CHAPTER 5   •  Uncertainty and Consumer Behavior  193
the price has always been $20, and they feel that a sharp increase in price after 
a snowstorm is unfair gouging and refuse to buy. Note also how we can modify standard demand curves to account for consumer attitudes towards fairness.
Another example of fairness arises in the ultimatum game.  Imagine that, under 
the following rules, you are offered a chance to divide 100 one-dollar bills with a stranger whom you will never meet again: You first propose a division of the money between you and the stranger. The stranger will respond by either accepting or rejecting your proposal. If he accepts, you each get the share that you proposed. If he rejects, you both get nothing. What should you do?
Because more money means more utility, our basic theory provides a clear 
answer to this question. You should propose that you get $99 while the other person gets only $1. Moreover, the responder should be happy to accept this proposal, because $1 is more than he had before and more than he would get if he rejected your offer (in both cases zero). This is a beneficial deal for both of you.
Yet most people facing this choice hesitate to make such an offer because they 
think it unfair, and many “strangers” would reject the offer. Why? The stranger might believe that because you both received the windfall opportunity to divide $100, a simple and fair division would be 50/50 or something close to that. Maybe the stranger will turn down the $1 offer to teach you that greediness is not appropriate behavior. Indeed, if you believe that the stranger will feel this way, it will be rational for you to offer a greater amount. In fact, when this game is played experimentally, typical sharing proposals range between 67/33 and 50/50, and such offers are normally accepted.
The ultimatum game shows how fairness can affect economic decisions. Not 
surprisingly, fairness concerns can also affect negotiations between firms and their workers. A firm may offer a higher wage to employees because the man-agers believe that workers deserve a comfortable standard of living or because they want to foster a pleasant working environment. Moreover, workers who do P

DEMAND FOR SNOW SHOVELS
Demand curve D1 applies during normal 
weather. Stores have been charging $20 and sell Q
1 shovels per month. When a 
snowstorm hits, the demand curve shifts to the right. Had the price remained $20, the quantity demanded would have increased to Q
2. But the new demand curve ( D2) does 
not extend up as far as the old one. Consum-ers view an increase in price to, say, $25 as fair, but an increase much above that as un-fair gouging. The new demand curve is very elastic at prices above $25, and no shovels can be sold at a price much above $30.194  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
not get a wage that they feel is fair may not put much effort into their work.29 
(In Section 17.6, we will see that paying workers higher-than-market wages can also be explained by the “efficiency wage theory” of labor markets, in which fairness concerns do not apply.) Fairness also affects the ways in which firms set prices and can explain why firms can more easily raise prices in response to higher costs than to increases in demand.
30
Fortunately, fairness concerns can be taken into account in the basic model 
of consumer behavior. If individuals moving to San Francisco believe that high apartment rents are unfair, their maximum willingness to pay for rental housing will be reduced. If a sufficient number of individuals feel this way, the resulting reduction in demand will lead to lower rental prices. Similarly, if enough work-ers do not feel that their wages are fair, there will be a reduction in the supply of labor, and wage rates will increase.
Rules of Thumb and Biases in Decision Making
Many economic (and everyday) decisions can be quite complex, especially if they involve choices about matters in which we have little experience. In such cases, people often resort to rule of thumb or other mental shortcuts to help them make decisions. In the tipping example, you took a mental shortcut when you decided to offer a 15-percent tip. The use of such rules of thumb, however, can introduce a bias into our economic decision making—something that our basic model does not allow.
31
ANCHORING  The mental rules that we use in making decisions frequently 
depend on both the context in which the decisions are made and the information available. For example, imagine that you just received a solicitation from a new local charity to make a donation. Rather than asking for a gift of any amount, the charity asks you to choose: $20, $50, $100, $250, or “other.” The purpose of these suggestions is to induce you to anchor your final donation. Anchoring  refers 
to the impact that a suggested (perhaps unrelated) piece of information may have on your final decision. Rather than trying to decide precisely how much to donate—say $44.52—and not wanting to appear miserly, one might simply write a check for the next higher category—$50. Another individual wishing to make only a token donation of $10 might choose the lowest stated amount, $20. In both cases, anchoring can bias individual choices toward larger donations. Similarly, it’s no coincidence so many price tags end with the digits 95 or 99. Marketers understand that consumers tend to overemphasize the first digit of prices, and also to think in terms of price categories like “under $20” or “over $20.” Thus to the consumer, who may not be thinking too carefully, $19.95 seems much cheaper than $20.01.
RULES OF THUMB  A common way to economize on the effort involved in 
making decisions is to ignore seemingly unimportant pieces of information. • anchoring  Tendency to rely 
heavily on one prior (suggested) piece of information when making a decision.

Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases,” Science  185 (September 1974): 1124–31.30See, for example, Julio J. Rotemberg, “Fair Pricing,” NBER Working Paper No. W10915, 2004.29For a general discussion of behavioral economics and the theory of wages and employment, see 
George Akerlof, “Behavioral Macroeconomics and Macroeconomic Behavior,” American Economic 
Review  92 (June 2002): 411–33.CHAPTER 5   •  Uncertainty and Consumer Behavior  195
For example, goods purchased over the Internet often involve shipping costs. 
Although small, these costs should be included as part of the good’s final price when making a  consumption decision. However, a recent study has shown that shipping costs are typically ignored by many consumers when deciding to buy things online. Their  decisions are biased because they view the price of goods to be lower than they really are.
32
Whereas depending on rules of thumb can introduce biases in decision mak-
ing, it is important to understand that they do serve a useful purpose. Frequently, rules of thumb help to save time and effort and result in only small biases. Thus, they should not be dismissed outright.
Consumers often face uncertainty when making decisions, and lack the 
understanding of probability to make those decisions optimally. (Consider the difficulty involved, for example, in calculating expected utility.) Consumers will often use rules of thumb when making decisions, but sometimes those rules of thumb can lead to strong biases.
THE LAW OF SMALL NUMBERS  People are sometimes prone to a bias called 
the law of small numbers:  They tend to overstate the probability that certain 
events will occur when faced with relatively little information from recent memory. For example, many people tend to overstate the likelihood that they or someone they know will die in a plane crash or win the lottery. Recall the  roulette player who bets on black after seeing red come up three times in a row: He has ignored the laws of probability.
Research has shown that investors in the stock market are often subject to 
a small-numbers bias, believing that high returns over the past few years are likely to be followed by more high returns over the next few years—thereby contributing to the kind of “herd behavior” that we discussed in the previous section. In this case, investors assess the likely payoff from investing by observ-ing the  market over a short period of time. In fact, one would have to study stock  market returns for many decades in order to estimate accurately the expected return on equity investments. Similarly when people assess the likelihood that housing prices will rise based on several years of data, the resulting mispercep-tions can result in housing price bubbles.
33
Although individuals may have some understanding of true probabilities (as 
when flipping a coin), complications arise when probabilities are unknown. For instance, few people have an idea about the probability that they or a friend will be in a car or airplane accident. In such cases, we form subjective probability assessments about such events. Our estimation of subjective probabilities may be close to true probabilities, but often they are not.
Forming subjective probabilities is not always an easy task and people are 
generally prone to several biases in the process. For instance, when evalu-ating the likelihood of an event, the context in which the evaluation is made can be very important. If a tragedy such as a plane crash has occurred recently, many people will tend to overestimate the probability of it happening to them. Likewise, when a probability for a particular event is very, very small, many people simply ignore that possibility in their decision making.• law of small

EXAMPLE 5.10  NEW YORK CITY TAXICAB DRIVERS
Most cab drivers rent their taxi-
cabs for a fixed daily fee from a company that owns a fleet of cars. They can then choose to drive the cab as little or as much as they want during a 12-hour period. As with many services, business is highly variable from day to day, depending on the weather, sub-way breakdowns, holidays, and so on. How do cabdrivers respond to these variations, many of which are largely unpredictable?
In many cities, taxicab rates are fixed by regula-
tion and do not change from day to day. However, on busy days drivers can earn a higher income because they do not have to spend as much time searching for riders. Traditional economic theory would predict that drivers will work longer hours on busy days than on slow days; an extra hour on a busy day might bring in $20, whereas an extra hour on a slow day might yield only $10. Does traditional  theory explain the actual 
behavior of taxicab drivers?
An interesting study analyzed actual taxicab 
trip records obtained from the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission for the spring of 1994.
34 The 
daily fee to rent a taxi was then $76, and gasoline cost about $15 per day. Surprisingly, the  researchers Summing Up
Where does this leave us? Should we dispense with the traditional consumer 
theory discussed in Chapters 3 and 4? Not at all. In fact, the basic theory that we learned up to now works quite well in many situations. It helps us to under-stand and evaluate the characteristics of consumer demand and to predict the impact on demand of changes in prices or incomes. Although it does not explain all consumer decisions, it sheds light on many of them. The developing field of behavioral economics tries to explain and to elaborate on those situations that are not well explained by the basic consumer model.
If you continue to study economics, you will notice many cases in which eco-
nomic models are not a perfect reflection of reality. Economists have to carefully decide, on a case-by-case basis, what features of the real world to include and what simplifying assumptions to make so that models are neither too compli-cated to study nor too simple to be useful.

also, Henry S. Farber, “Reference-Dependent Preferences and Labor Supply: The Case of New York City Taxi Drivers,” American Economic Review  98 (2008): 1069–82.found that most drivers drive 
more  hours on slow days and 
fewer  hours on busy days. In 
other words, there is a nega-
tive relationship  between the 
effective hourly wage and the number of hours worked each day; the higher the wage, the sooner the  cabdrivers quit for the 
day. Behavioral economics can 
explain this result. Suppose that most taxicab driv-ers have an income target for each day. That target effectively serves as a reference point. Daily income  targeting makes sense from a behavioral perspec-
tive. An income target provides a simple decision rule for drivers because they need only keep a record of their fares for the day. A daily target also helps drivers with potential self-control problems; without a target, a driver may choose to quit earlier on many days just to avoid the hassles of the job. The target in the 1994 study appeared to be about $150 per day.
Still other studies challenge this “behavioral” 
explanation of behavior. A different study, also of New York City cab drivers who rented their taxis, concluded that the traditional economic model does indeed offer important insights into drivers’ 
CHAPTER 5   •  Uncertainty and Consumer Behavior  197
behavior.35 The study concluded that daily income 
had only a small effect on a driver’s decision as to when to quit for the day. Rather, the decision to stop appears to be based on the cumulative number of hours already worked that day and not on hitting a specific income target.
What may soon become known as “the great 
taxicab driver debate” did not end here. A recent study sought to explain these two seemingly  contradictory results. Reanalyzing the same taxicab 
trip records, the authors found that the traditional economic model goes a long way in explaining most workday decisions of taxicab drivers, but that a behavioral model that accounts for reference points and targeted goals (for income and hours) can do even better.

about the taxicab industry, you can look ahead to the examples in Chapters 8, 9, and 15.

 1. Consumers and managers frequently make decisions 
in which there is uncertainty about the future. This uncertainty is characterized by the term risk, which 
applies when each of the possible outcomes and its probability of occurrence is known.
 2. Consumers and investors are concerned about the 
expected value and the variability of uncertain out-comes. The expected value is a measure of the central tendency of the values of risky outcomes. Variability is frequently measured by the standard deviation of outcomes, which is the square root of the probability-weighted average of the squares of the deviation from the expected value of each possible outcome.
 3. Facing uncertain choices, consumers maximize their 
expected utility—an average of the utility associated with each outcome—with the associated probabilities serving as weights.
 4. A person who would prefer a certain return of a given 
amount to a risky investment with the same expected return is risk averse. The maximum amount of money that a risk-averse person would pay to avoid tak-ing a risk is called the risk premium.  A person who is  indifferent between a risky investment and the certain 
receipt of the expected return on that investment is risk neutral. A risk-loving consumer would prefer a risky investment with a given expected return to the certain receipt of that expected return.
 5. Risk can be reduced by (a) diversification, (b) insur-
ance, and (c) additional information.
 6. The law of large numbers  enables insurance companies 
to provide insurance for which the premiums paid 
equal the expected value of the losses being insured 
against. We call such insurance actuarially fair.
 7. Consumer theory can be applied to decisions to invest 
in risky assets. The budget line reflects the price of risk, and consumers’ indifference curves reflect their attitudes toward risk.
 8. Individual behavior sometimes seems unpredictable, 
even irrational, and contrary to the assumptions that underlie the basic model of consumer choice. The study of behavioral economics enriches consumer the-ory by accounting for reference points, endowment effects, 
anchoring,  fairness considerations, and deviations from 
the laws of probability.

the resulting total demand curve for e-books. How has the “rule of thumb” behavior affected the elasticity of total demand for e-books?This page intentionally left blank  201
In the last three chapters, we focused on the demand side  of the 
 market—the preferences and behavior of consumers. Now we turn to the supply side  and examine the behavior of producers. We will 
see how firms can produce efficiently and how their costs of produc-tion change with changes in both input prices and the level of output. We will also see that there are strong similarities between the optimizing decisions made by firms and those made by consumers. In other words, understanding consumer behavior will help us understand producer behavior.
In this chapter and the next we discuss the theory of the firm,  which 
describes how a firm makes cost-minimizing production decisions and how the firm’s resulting cost varies with its output. Our knowledge of production and cost will help us understand the characteristics of market supply. It will also prove useful for dealing with problems that arise regularly in business. To see this, just consider some of the problems often faced by a company like General Motors. How much assembly-line machinery and how much labor should it use in its new automobile plants? If it wants to increase production, should it hire more workers, construct new plants, or both? Does it make more sense for one automobile plant to produce different models, or should each model be manufactured in a separate plant? What should GM expect its costs to be during the coming year? How are these costs likely to change over time and be affected by the level of production? These questions apply not only to business firms but also to other producers of goods and services, such as governments and nonprofit agencies.
The Production Decisions of a Firm
In Chapters 3 and 4, we studied consumer behavior by breaking it down into three steps. First, we explained how to describe consumer preferences. Second, we accounted for the fact that consumers face budget constraints. Third, we saw how, given their preferences and budget constraints, consumers can choose combinations of goods to maximize their satisfaction. The production decisions of firms are analogous to the purchasing decisions of consumers, and can likewise be understood in three steps:
 1. Production Technology:  We need a practical way of describ-
ing how inputs  (such as labor, capital, and raw materials) can be 6.1

 transformed into outputs  (such as cars and televisions). Just as a consumer 
can reach a level of satisfaction from buying different combinations of goods, the firm can produce a particular level of output by using different com-binations of inputs. For example, an electronics firm might produce 10,000 televisions per month by using a substantial amount of labor (e.g., workers assembling the televisions by hand) and very little capital, or by building a highly automated capital-intensive factory and using very little labor.
 2. Cost Constraints:  Firms must take into account the prices  of labor, capital, 
and other inputs. Just as a consumer is constrained by a limited budget, the firm will be concerned about its cost of production. For example, the firm that produces 10,000 televisions per month will want to do so in a way that minimizes its total production cost, which is determined in part by the prices of the inputs it uses.
 3. Input Choices:  Given its production technology and the prices of labor, 
capital, and other inputs, the firm must choose how much of each input  to 
use in producing its output. Just as a consumer takes account of the prices of different goods when deciding how much of each good to buy, the firm must take into account the prices of different inputs when deciding how much of each input to use. If our electronics firm operates in a country with low wage rates, it may decide to produce televisions by using a large amount of labor, thereby using very little capital.
These three steps are the building blocks of the theory of the firm, and we 
will discuss them in detail in this chapter and the next. We will also address other important aspects of firm behavior. For example, assuming that the firm is always using a cost-minimizing combination of inputs, we will see how its total cost of production varies with the quantity it produces and how it can choose that quantity to maximize its profit.
We begin this chapter by discussing the nature of the firm and asking why 
firms exist in the first place. Next, we explain how the firm’s production technol-ogy can be represented in the form of a production function —a compact descrip-
tion of how inputs are turned into output. We then use the production function to show how the firm’s output changes when just one of its inputs (labor) is varied, holding the other inputs fixed. Next, we turn to the more general case in which the firm can vary all of its inputs, and we show how the firm chooses a cost-minimizing combination of inputs to produce its output. We will be particularly concerned with the scale  of the firm’s operation. Are there, for example, any tech-
nological advantages that make the firm more productive as its scale increases?
6.1  Firms and Their Production Decisions
Firms as we know them today are a relatively new invention. Prior to the mid-1800s, almost all production was done by farmers, craftsmen, individuals who wove cloth and made clothing, and merchants and traders who bought and sold various goods. This was true in the U.S., Europe, and everywhere else in the world. The concept of a firm—run by managers separate from the firm’s own-ers, and who hire and manage a large number of workers—did not even exist. Modern corporations emerged only in the latter part of the 19
th century.1• theory of the

1The classic history of the development of the modern corporation is Alfred Chandler, Jr., The Visible 
Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business , Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1977.CHAPTER 6   •  Production  203
Today we take firms for granted. It is hard for us to imagine the production 
of automobiles without large companies like Ford and Toyota, the production of oil and natural gas without companies like Exxon-Mobil and Shell, or even the production of breakfast cereal without companies like Kellogg and General Mills. But stop for a minute and ask yourself whether we really need firms to produce the goods and services that we consume regularly. This was the ques-tion raised by Ronald Coase in a famous 1937 article: If markets work so well in allocating resources, why do we need firms?
2
Why Do Firms Exist?
Do we really need firms to produce cars? Why couldn’t cars be produced by a collection of individuals who worked independently and contracted with each other when appropriate, rather than being employed by General Motors? Couldn’t some people design a car (for a fee), other people buy steel, rent the equipment needed to stamp the steel into the shapes called for in the design, and then do the stamping (also for negotiated fees), other people make steering wheels and radiators, still other people assemble the various parts, and so on, where again, every task would be performed for a negotiated fee?
Or take another example: We—the authors of this book—work for universi-
ties, which are essentially firms that provide educational services along with research. We are paid monthly salaries and in return are expected to teach regu-larly (to students recruited by our “firms” and in classrooms the “firms” pro-vide), do research and write (in the offices our “firms” give us), and carry out administrative tasks. Couldn’t we simply bypass the universities and offer our teaching services on an hourly basis in rented classrooms to students who show up and pay us, and likewise do research on a paid piecemeal basis? Do we really need colleges and universities with all their overhead costs?
In principle, cars could indeed be produced by a large number of indepen-
dent workers, and an education could be produced by a number of independent teachers. These independent workers would offer their services for negotiated fees, and those fees would be determined by market supply and demand. It shouldn’t take you long, however, to realize that such a system of production would be extremely inefficient. Think about how difficult it would be for inde-pendent workers to decide who will do what to produce cars, and negotiate the fees that each worker will charge for each task. And if there were any change in the design of the car, all of these tasks and fees would have to be renegotiated. For cars produced this way, the quality would likely be abysmal, and the cost astronomical.
Firms offer a means of coordination  that is extremely important and would be 
sorely missing if workers operated independently. Firms eliminate the need for every worker to negotiate every task that he or she will perform, and bargain over the fees that will be paid for those tasks. Firms can avoid this kind of bar-gaining by having managers that direct the production of salaried workers —they 
tell workers what to do and when to do it, and the workers (as well as the man-agers themselves) are simply paid a weekly or monthly salary.
There is no guarantee, of course, that a firm will operate efficiently, and there are 
many examples of firms that operate very inefficiently. Managers cannot always monitor what workers are doing, and managers themselves sometimes make

in Economics in 1991.204  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
decisions that are in their interest, but not in the firm’s best interest. As a result, 
the theory of the firm (and more broadly, organizational economics ) has become an 
important area of microeconomic research. The theory has both positive aspects (explaining why managers and workers behave the way they do) and normative aspects (explaining how firms can be best organized so that they operate as effi-ciently as possible).
3 We will discuss some aspects of the theory later in this book. 
At this point we simply stress that firms exist because they allow goods and ser-vices to be produced far more efficiently than would be possible without them.
The Technology of Production
What do firms do? We have seen that firms organize and coordinate the activi-ties of large numbers of workers and managers. But to what purpose? At the most fundamental level, firms take inputs  and turn them into outputs  (or prod-
ucts). This production process, turning inputs into outputs, is the essence of what a firm does. Inputs, which are also called factors of production,  include 
anything that the firm must use as part of the production process. In a bakery, for example, inputs include the labor of its workers; raw materials, such as flour and sugar; and the capital invested in its ovens, mixers, and other equipment needed to produce such outputs as bread, cakes, and pastries.
As you can see, we can divide inputs into the broad categories of labor , materi-
als, and capital , each of which might include more narrow subdivisions. Labor 
inputs include skilled workers (carpenters, engineers) and unskilled workers (agricultural workers), as well as the entrepreneurial efforts of the firm’s manag-ers. Materials include steel, plastics, electricity, water, and any other goods that the firm buys and transforms into final products. Capital includes land, build-ings, machinery and other equipment, as well as inventories.
The Production Function
Firms can turn inputs into outputs in a variety of ways, using various combina-tions of labor, materials, and capital. We can describe the relationship between the inputs into the production process and the resulting output by a production 
function . A production function  indicates the highest output q that a firm can 
produce for every specified combination of inputs.
4 Although in practice firms 
use a wide variety of inputs, we will keep our analysis simple by focusing on only two, labor L and capital K. We can then write the production function as
 q=F(K, L) (6.1)
This equation relates the quantity of output to the quantities of the two inputs, 
capital and labor. For example, the production function might describe the num-ber of personal computers that can be produced each year with a 10,000-square-foot plant and a specific amount of assembly-line labor. Or it might describe the crop that a farmer can obtain using specific amounts of machinery and workers.
It is important to keep in mind that inputs and outputs are flows . For exam-
ple, our PC manufacturer uses a certain amount of labor each year  to produce 
some number of computers over that year. Although it might own its plant and • factors of production

3The literature on the theory of the firm is vast. One of the classics is Oliver Williamson, Markets and 
Hierarchies: Analysis and Antitrust Implications , New York: Free Press, 1975. (Williamson won a Nobel 
Prize for his work in 2009.)
4In this chapter and those that follow, we will use the variable q for the output of the firm, and Q for 
the output of the industry.CHAPTER 6   •  Production  205
machinery, we can think of the firm as paying a cost for the use of that plant 
and machinery over the year. To simplify things, we will frequently ignore the reference to time and refer only to amounts of labor, capital, and output. Unless otherwise indicated, however, we mean the amount of labor and capital used each year and the amount of output produced each year.
Because the production function allows inputs to be combined in varying 
proportions, output can be produced in many ways. For the production func-tion in equation (6.1), this could mean using more capital and less labor, or vice versa. For example, wine can be produced in a labor-intensive way using many workers, or in a capital-intensive way using machines and only a few workers.
Note that equation (6.1) applies to a given technology —that is, to a given state 
of knowledge about the various methods that might be used to transform inputs into outputs. As the technology becomes more advanced and the production function changes, a firm can obtain more output for a given set of inputs. For example, a new, faster assembly line may allow a hardware manufacturer to produce more high-speed computers in a given period of time.
Production functions describe what is technically feasible  when the firm oper-
ates efficiently —that is, when the firm uses each combination of inputs as effec-
tively as possible. The presumption that production is always technically effi-cient need not always hold, but it is reasonable to expect that profit-seeking firms will not waste resources.
The Short Run versus the Long Run
It takes time for a firm to adjust its inputs to produce its product with differing amounts of labor and capital. A new factory must be planned and built, and machinery and other capital equipment must be ordered and delivered. Such activities can easily take a year or more to complete. As a result, if we are look-ing at production decisions over a short period of time, such as a month or two, the firm is unlikely to be able to substitute very much capital for labor.
Because firms must consider whether or not inputs can be varied, and if they 
can, over what period of time, it is important to distinguish between the short and long run when analyzing production. The short run  refers to a period of 
time in which the quantities of one or more factors of production cannot be changed. In other words, in the short run there is at least one factor that cannot be varied; such a factor is called a fixed input.  The long run  is the amount of 
time needed to make all inputs variable.
As you might expect, the kinds of decisions that firms can make are very 
different in the short run than those made  in the long run. In the short run, firms 
vary the intensity with which they utilize a given plant and machinery; in the long run, they vary the size of the plant. All fixed inputs in the short run repre-sent the outcomes of previous long-run decisions based on estimates of what a firm could profitably produce and sell.
There is no specific time period, such as one year, that separates the short run 
from the long run. Rather, one must distinguish them on a case-by-case basis. For example, the long run can be as brief as a day or two for a child’s lemonade stand or as long as five or ten years for a petrochemical producer or an automo-bile manufacturer.
We will see that in the long run firms can vary the amounts of all their inputs 
to minimize the cost of production. Before treating this general case, however, we begin with an analysis of the short run, in which only one input to the pro-duction process can be varied. We assume that capital is the fixed input, and labor is variable.• short run  Period of time in 
which quantities of one or more production factors cannot be changed.

6.2   Production with One Variable 
Input (Labor)
When deciding how much of a particular input to buy, a firm has to compare the 
benefit that will result with the cost of that input. Sometimes it is useful to look at the benefit and the cost on an incremental  basis by focusing on the additional out-
put that results from an incremental addition to an input. In other situations, it is useful to make the comparison on an average  basis by considering the result of 
substantially increasing an input. We will look at benefits and costs in both ways.
When capital is fixed but labor is variable, the only way the firm can produce 
more output is by increasing its labor input. Imagine, for example, that you are managing a clothing factory. Although you have a fixed amount of equipment, you can hire more or less labor to sew and to run the machines. You must decide how much labor to hire and how much clothing to produce. To make the deci-sion, you will need to know how the amount of output q increases (if at all) as 
the input of labor L increases.
Table 6.1 gives this information. The first three columns show the amount of 
output that can be produced in one month with different amounts of labor and capital fixed at 10 units. The first column shows the amount of labor, the second the fixed amount of capital, and the third total output. When labor input is zero, output is also zero. Output then increases as labor is increased up to an input of 8 units. Beyond that point, total output declines: Although initially each unit of labor can take greater and greater advantage of the existing machinery and plant, after a certain point, additional labor is no longer useful and indeed can be counterproductive. Five people can run an assembly line better than two, but ten people may get in one another’s way.
Average and Marginal Products
The contribution that labor makes to the production process can be described on both an average  and a marginal  (i.e., incremental) basis. The fourth  column 
in Table 6.1 shows the average product  of labor (AP
L ), which is the  output per • average product  Output 
per unit of a particular input.

unit of labor input. The average product is calculated by dividing the total out-
put q by the total input of labor L. The average product of labor measures the 
productivity of the firm’s workforce in terms of how much output each worker produces on average. In our example, the average product increases initially but falls when the labor input becomes greater than four.
The fifth column of Table 6.1 shows the marginal product  of labor (MP
L). This 
is the additional  output produced as the labor input is increased by 1 unit. For 
example, with capital fixed at 10 units, when the labor input increases from 2 to 3, total output increases from 30 to 60, creating an additional output of 30 (i.e., 60–30) units. The marginal product of labor can be written as /H9004q/
/H9004L—in other 
words, the change in output /H9004q resulting from a 1-unit increase in labor input /H9004L.
Remember that the marginal product of labor depends on the amount of capital 
used. If the capital input increased from 10 to 20, the marginal product of labor most likely would increase. Why? Because additional workers are likely to be more productive if they have more capital to use. Like the average product, the marginal product first increases then falls—in this case, after the third unit of labor.
To summarize:
 Average product of labor =Output/labor input =q/L
 Marginal product of labor =Change in output/change in labor input
 =/H9004q//H9004L
The Slopes of the Product Curve
Figure 6.1 plots the information contained in Table 6.1. (We have connected all 
the points in the figure with solid lines.) Figure 6.1 (a) shows that as labor is increased, output increases until it reaches the maximum output of 112; thereaf-ter, it falls. The portion of the total output curve that is declining is drawn with a dashed line to denote that producing with more than eight workers is not economically rational; it can never be profitable to use additional amounts of a costly input to produce less output.
Figure 6.1 (b) shows the average and marginal product curves. (The units on 
the vertical axis have changed from output per month to output per worker per month.) Note that the marginal product is positive as long as output is increas-ing, but becomes negative when output is decreasing.
It is no coincidence that the marginal product curve crosses the horizontal 
axis of the graph at the point of maximum total product. This happens because adding a worker in a manner that slows production and decreases total output implies a negative marginal product for that worker.
The average product and marginal product curves are closely related. When 
the marginal product is greater than the average product, the average product is increas-ing. This is the case for labor inputs up to 4 in Figure 6.1 (b). If the output of an 
additional worker is greater than the average output of each existing worker (i.e., the marginal product is greater than the average product), then adding the worker causes average output to rise. In Table 6.1, two workers produce 30 units of output, for an average product of 15 units per worker. Adding a third worker increases output by 30 units (to 60), which raises the average product from 15 to 20.
Similarly, when the marginal product is less than the average product, the average 
product is decreasing . This is the case when the labor input is greater than 4 in 
Figure 6.1 (b). In Table 6.1, six workers produce 108 units of output, for an aver-age product of 18. Adding a seventh worker contributes a marginal product of only 4 units (less than the average product), reducing the average product to 16.• marginal product
Additional output produced as 
an input is increased by one unit.208  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
We have seen that the marginal product is above the average product when 
the average product is increasing and below the average product when the aver-age product is decreasing. It follows, therefore, that the marginal product must equal the average product when the average product reaches its maximum. This happens at point E in Figure 6.1 (b).
Why, in practice, should we expect the marginal product curve to rise and 
then fall? Think of a television assembly plant. Fewer than ten workers might be insufficient to operate the assembly line at all. Ten to fifteen workers might be able to run the assembly line, but not very efficiently. If adding a few more workers allowed the assembly line to operate much more efficiently, the mar-ginal product of those workers would be very high. This added efficiency, however, might start to diminish once there were more than 20 workers. The marginal product of the twenty-second worker, for example, might still be very high (and above the average product), but not as high as the marginal product of the nineteenth or twentieth worker. The marginal product of the  twenty-fifth worker might be lower still, perhaps equal to the average product. With 30 workers, adding one more worker would yield more output, but not very 12 91 0

PRODUCTION WITH ONE  
VARIABLE INPUT
The total product curve in (a) shows the output 
produced for different amounts of labor input. The average and marginal products in (b) can be 
obtained (using the data in Table 6.1) from the total product curve. At point A in (a), the mar-
ginal product is 20 because the tangent to the total product curve has a slope of 20. At point B 
in (a) the average product of labor is 20, which is 
the slope of the line from the origin to B. The 
average product of labor at point C in (a) is giv-
en by the slope of the line 0 C. To the left of point 
E in (b), the marginal product is above the aver-
age product and the average is increasing; to the right of E, the marginal product is below the 
average product and the average is decreasing. As a result, E represents the point at which the 
average and marginal products are equal, when the average product reaches its maximum.CHAPTER 6   •  Production  209
much more (so that the marginal product, while positive, would be below the 
average product). Once there were more than 40 workers, additional workers would simply get in each other’s way and actually reduce output (so that the marginal product would be negative).
The Average Product of Labor Curve
The geometric relationship between the total product and the average and marginal product curves is shown in Figure 6.1 (a). The average product of labor is the total product divided by the quantity of labor input. At B, for example, the average prod-
uct is equal to the output of 60 divided by the input of 3, or 20 units of output per unit of labor input. This ratio, however, is exactly the slope of the line running from the origin to B in Figure 6.1 (a). In general, the average product of labor is given by the 
slope of the line drawn from the origin to the corresponding point on the total product curve .
The Marginal Product of Labor Curve
As we have seen, the marginal product of labor is the change in the total product 
resulting from an increase of one unit of labor. At A, for example, the marginal 
product is 20 because the tangent to the total product curve has a slope of 20. In general, the marginal product of labor at a point is given by the slope of the total prod-
uct at that point . We can see in Figure 6.1 (b) that the marginal product of labor 
increases initially, peaks at an input of 3, and then declines as we move up the total product curve to C and D. At D, when total output is maximized, the slope 
of the tangent to the total product curve is 0, as is the marginal product. Beyond that point, the marginal product becomes negative.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AVERAGE AND MARGINAL 
PRODUCTS  Note the graphical relationship between average and marginal 
products in Figure 6.1 (a). At B, the marginal product of labor (the slope of the 
tangent to the total product curve at B—not shown explicitly) is greater than 
the average product (dashed line 0 B). As a result, the average product of labor 
increases as we move from B to C. At C, the average and marginal products of 
labor are equal: While the average product is the slope of the line from the origin, 0C, the marginal product is the tangent to the total product curve at C (note the 
equality of the average and marginal products at point E in Figure 6.1 (b)). Finally, 
as we move beyond C toward D, the marginal product falls below the average 
product; you can check that the slope of the tangent to the total product curve at any point between C and D is lower than the slope of the line from the origin.
The Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns
A diminishing marginal product of labor (as well as a diminishing marginal 
product of other inputs) holds for most production processes. The law of dimin-
ishing marginal returns  states that as the use of an input increases in equal 
increments (with other inputs fixed), a point will eventually be reached at which the resulting additions to output decrease. When the labor input is small (and capital is fixed), extra labor adds considerably to output, often because workers are allowed to devote themselves to specialized tasks. Eventually, however, the law of diminishing marginal returns applies: When there are too many workers, some workers become ineffective and the marginal product of labor falls.
The law of diminishing marginal returns usually applies to the short run 
when at least one input is fixed. However, it can also apply to the long run. • law of diminishing marginal 
returns  Principle that as 
the use of an input increases with other inputs fixed, the resulting additions to output will eventually decrease.210  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
Even though inputs are variable in the long run, a manager may still want 
to analyze production choices for which one or more inputs are unchanged. Suppose, for example, that only two plant sizes are feasible and that  management must decide which to build. In that case, management would want to know when diminishing marginal returns will set in for each of the two options.
Do not confuse the law of diminishing marginal returns with possible 
changes in the quality  of labor as labor inputs are increased (as would likely 
occur, for example, if the most highly qualified laborers are hired first and the least qualified last). In our analysis of production, we have assumed that all labor inputs are of equal quality; diminishing marginal returns results from lim-itations on the use of other fixed inputs (e.g., machinery), not from declines in worker quality. In addition, do not confuse diminishing marginal returns with negative  returns. The law of diminishing marginal returns describes a declining  
marginal product but not necessarily a negative one.
The law of diminishing marginal returns applies to a given production tech-
nology. Over time, however, inventions and other improvements in technology may allow the entire total product curve in Figure 6.1 (a) to shift upward, so that more output can be produced with the same inputs. Figure 6.2 illustrates this principle. Initially the output curve is given by O
1, but improvements in tech-
nology may allow the curve to shift upward, first to O2, and later to O3.
Suppose, for example, that over time, as labor is increased in agricultural 
production, technological improvements are being made. These improvements might include genetically engineered pest-resistant seeds, more powerful and effective fertilizers, and better farm equipment. As a result, output changes from A (with an input of 6 on curve O
1) to B (with an input of 7 on curve O2) to C (with 
an input of 8 on curve O3).
The move from A to B to C relates an increase in labor input to an increase in 
output and makes it appear that there are no diminishing marginal returns when in fact there are. Indeed, the shifting of the total product curve suggests that there may be no negative long-run implications for economic growth. In fact, as

O3 over time, labor productivity increases.CHAPTER 6   •  Production  211
EXAMPLE 6.1  A PRODUCTION FUNCTION FOR HEALTH CARE
Expenditures on health 
care have increased rapidly in many countries. This is especially true in the United States, which has been spending 15% of its GDP on health care in recent years. But other countries also devote substantial resources to health care (e.g., 11% of GDP in France and Germany and 8% of GDP in Japan and the United Kingdom). Do these increased expenditures reflect increases in output or do they reflect  inefficiencies in the 
production process?Figure 6.3 shows a produc-
tion function for health care in the United States.
5 The 
vertical axis utilizes one pos-sible measure of health out-put, the average increase in life expectancy for the popu-lation. (Another measure of output might be reductions in the average numbers of heart attacks or strokes.) The hori-
zontal axis measures thousands of dollars spent on health care inputs, which include expenditures on doctors, nurses, administrators, hospital  equipment, 
and drugs. The production function represents

the maximum achievable health outcome for the 
population as a whole, as a function of the dollars spent per capita on health care inputs. Points on the  production function such as A, B, and C are by 
construction inputs that are being used as efficiently as possible to produce output. Point D, which lies below the production function, is inefficient in that the health care inputs associated with D do not gen-erate the maximum possible health output.
Notice that the production function exhibits dimin-
ishing returns: it becomes relatively flat as more and more money is spent on health care. For example, the health output at point B is quite a bit higher than the output at point A since the marginal productivity of health care expenditures is high. Starting at point A, an additional $20,000 of health expenditures (from $10,000 to $30,000) increases life expectancy by 3 years. However, output at C is only slightly higher than the output at B, even though the difference in health inputs is large. In moving from B to C, an addi-tional $20,000 of health expenditures increases life expectancy by only 1 year. Why is this? The answer is that given current medical technologies, additional expenditures on medical procedures and/or the use of newer drugs has only a minimal effect on life expectancy rates. Thus the marginal productivity of dollars expended on health has become less and less effective as the expenditure level increases.
We can now see one possible explanation for 
the high level of health-care expenditures in the United States. The United States is relatively wealthy, and it is natural for consumer preferences to shift toward more health care as incomes grow, even as it becomes more and more expensive to obtain even modest increases in life expectancy. (Recall our dis-cussion of health care choice in Example 3.4.) Thus, Americans may have been seeking better and bet-ter medical outcomes, but with limited success, given 
the shape of the health care production function. In other words, compared to other countries, the United States may be operating farther to the right along the flat portion of the health-care production function.
There is another explanation, however. It may 
be that the production of health care in the United States is inefficient, i.e., higher medical outputs could be achieved with the same or similar input expenditures if those expenditures were more effectively utilized. In Figure 6.3, this is shown as a move from point D to point B; here with no addi-tional expenditure life expectancy is increased by 1 year by using inputs more efficiently. A compari-son of various measures of health and health care across a number of developed countries suggests that this may indeed be the case. First, only 28 per-cent of primary care physicians use electronic health records in the United States, compared to 89 per-cent in the United Kingdom and 98 percent in the Netherlands. Second, the percentage of chronically ill patients that did not pursue care, did not fol-low recommended treatments, or did not take fully recommended medications was 42 percent in the United States compared to 9 percent in the United Kingdom and 20 percent in Germany. Third, the billing, insurance, and credentialing system is more complex and burdensome in the United States than in many other countries, so the number of health care administrative personnel per capita is greater.
Both explanations for U.S. health care spending 
probably have some validity. It is likely that the United States indeed suffers from inefficiency in health care production. It is also likely that as U.S. incomes grow, people will demand more and more health care rela-tive to other goods, so that with diminishing returns, the incremental health benefits will be limited.
6Thomas Malthus, Essay on the Principle of Population , 1798.EXAMPLE 6.2  MALTHUS AND THE FOOD CRISIS
The law of diminishing marginal returns was central to 
the thinking of political economist Thomas Malthus (1766–1834).
6 Malthus believed that the world’s lim-
ited amount of land would not be able to supply enough food as the population grew. He predicted 
that as both the marginal and average productivity of labor fell and there were more mouths to feed, mass hunger and starvation would result. Fortunately, CHAPTER 6   •  Production  213

Organization (FAO). See also http://faostat.fao.org .
8Data are from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Bank. See also 
http://faostat.fao.org .Malthus was wrong (although he was right about the 
diminishing marginal returns to labor).
Over the past century, technological improve-
ments have dramatically altered food produc-tion in most countries (including developing countries, such as India). As a result, the aver-age product of labor and total food output have increased. These improvements include new high-yielding, disease-resistant strains of seeds, better fertilizers, and better harvesting equip-ment. As the food production index in Table 6.2 shows, overall food production throughout the world has outpaced population growth continu-ally since 1960.
7 This increase in world agricultural 
productivity is also illustrated in Figure 6.4, which shows average cereal yields from 1970 through 2005, along with a world price index for food.

Labor Productivity
Although this is a textbook in microeconomics, many of the concepts developed 
here provide a foundation for macroeconomic analysis. Macroeconomists are particularly concerned with labor productivity —the average product of labor 
for an entire industry or for the economy as a whole. In this subsection we dis-cuss labor productivity in the United States and a number of foreign countries. This topic is interesting in its own right, but will also help to illustrate one of the links between micro- and macroeconomics.
Because the average product measures output per unit of labor input, it is 
relatively easy to measure (total labor input and total output are the only pieces of information you need). Labor productivity can provide useful comparisons across industries and for one industry over a long period. But labor productiv-ity is especially important because it determines the real standard of living  that a 
country can achieve for its citizens.
PRODUCTIVITY AND THE STANDARD OF LIVING  There is a simple link 
between labor productivity and the standard of living. In any particular year, the aggregate value of goods and services produced by an economy is equal to the payments made to all factors of production, including wages, rental payments to capital, and profit to firms. Consumers ultimately receive these factor payments in the form of wages, salaries, dividends, or interest  payments. As a result, consumers in the aggregate can increase their rate of consumption in the long run only by increasing the total amount they produce.
Understanding the causes of productivity growth is an important area of 
research in economics. We do know that one of the most important sources of growth in labor productivity is growth in the stock of capital —i.e., the total 
amount of capital available for use in production. Because an increase in capi-tal means more and better machinery, each worker can produce more output for each hour worked. Another important source of growth in labor produc-tivity is technological change —i.e., the development of new technologies that 
allow labor (and other factors of production) to be used more effectively and to  produce new and higher-quality goods.
As Example 6.3 shows, levels of labor productivity have differed consider-
ably across countries, as have rates of growth of productivity. Given the central role that productivity has in affecting our standards of living, understanding these differences is important.• labor productivity  Average 
product of labor for an entire industry or for the economy as a whole.

technologies allowing factors of production to be used more effectively.outstripped the growth in demand, prices, apart 
from a temporary increase in the early 1970s, have been declining.
Hunger remains a severe problem in some 
areas, such as the Sahel region of Africa, in part because of the low productivity of labor there. Although other countries produce an agricul-
tural surplus, mass  hunger still occurs because of  
the difficulty of redistributing food from more to less productive regions of the world and because of the low incomes of those less productive regions.CHAPTER 6   •  Production  215
EXAMPLE 6.3  LABOR PRODUCTIVITY AND THE STANDARD OF LIVING
Will the standard of living in the 
United States, Europe, and Japan continue to improve, or will these economies barely keep future gen-erations from being worse off than they are today? Because the real incomes of consumers in these coun-tries increase only as fast as produc-tivity does, the answer depends on the labor productivity of workers.
As Table 6.3 shows, the level of 
output per employed person in the United States in 2009 was higher than in other industrial coun-tries. But two patterns over the post–World War II period have been disturbing. First, until the 1990s, productivity in the United States grew on average less rapidly than productivity in most other devel-oped nations. Second,  productivity growth during 
1974–2009 was much lower in all developed coun-tries than it had been in the past.
9
Throughout most of the 1960–1991 period, 
Japan had the highest rate of productivity growth, followed by Germany and France. U.S. productiv-ity growth was the lowest, even somewhat lower than that of the United Kingdom. This is partly due to differences in rates of investment and growth in the stock of capital in each country. 
The greatest capital growth during the postwar period was in Japan, France, and Germany, which were rebuilt substantially after World War II. To some extent, therefore, the lower rate of growth of productiv-ity in the United States, when com-pared to that of Japan, France, and Germany, is the result of these coun-tries catching up after the war.
Productivity growth is also tied to the natural 
resource sector of the economy. As oil and other resources began to be depleted, output per worker fell. Environmental regulations (e.g., the need to restore land to its original condition after strip-mining for coal) magnified this effect as the public became more concerned with the importance of cleaner air and water.
Observe from Table 6.3 that productivity growth 
in the United States accelerated in the 1990s. Some economists believe that information and communi-cation technology (ICT) has been the key impetus for this growth. However, sluggish growth in more recent years suggests that ICT’s contribution may have already peaked.

6.3  Production with Two Variable Inputs
We have completed our analysis of the short-run production function in which 
one input, labor, is variable, and the other, capital, is fixed. Now we turn to the long run, for which both labor and capital are variable. The firm can now pro-duce its output in a variety of ways by combining different amounts of labor and capital. In this section, we will see how a firm can choose among combi-nations of labor and capital that generate the same output. In the first subsec-tion, we will examine the scale of the production process, analyzing how output changes as input combinations are doubled, tripled, and so on.
Isoquants
Let’s begin by examining the production technology of a firm that uses two inputs and can vary both of them. Suppose that the inputs are labor and capital and that they are used to produce food. Table 6.4 tabulates the output achievable for various combinations of inputs.
Labor inputs are listed across the top row, capital inputs down the column 
on the left. Each entry in the table is the maximum (technically efficient) output that can be produced each year with each combination of labor and capital used over that year. For example, 4 units of labor per year and 2 units of capital per year yield 85 units of food per year. Reading along each row, we see that out-put increases as labor inputs are increased, while capital inputs remain fixed. Reading down each column, we see that output also increases as capital inputs are increased, while labor inputs remain fixed.
The information in Table 6.4 can also be represented graphically using iso-
quants. An isoquant  is a curve that shows all the possible combinations of inputs that 
yield the same output . Figure 6.5 shows three isoquants. (Each axis in the figure mea-
sures the quantity of inputs.) These isoquants are based on the data in Table 6.4, but are drawn as smooth curves to allow for the use of fractional amounts of inputs.
For example, isoquant q
1 shows all combinations of labor and capital per year 
that together yield 55 units of output per year. Two of these points, A and D, cor-
respond to Table 6.4. At A, 1 unit of labor and 3 units of capital yield 55 units of 
output; at D, the same output is produced from 3 units of labor and 1 unit of capi-
tal. Isoquant q2 shows all combinations of inputs that yield 75 units of output and 
corresponds to the four combinations of labor and capital circled in the table (e.g., at B, where 2 units of labor and 3 units of capital are combined). Isoquant q
2 lies 
above and to the right of q1 because obtaining a higher level of output requires • isoquant  Curve showing all 
possible combinations of inputs that yield the same output.

more labor and capital. Finally, isoquant q3 shows labor-capital combinations that 
yield 90 units of output. Point C, for example, involves 3 units of labor and 3 units 
of capital, whereas Point E involves 2 units of labor and 5 units of capital.
ISOQUANT MAPS  When a number of isoquants are combined in a single 
graph, we call the graph an isoquant map.  Figure 6.5 shows three of the many 
isoquants that make up an isoquant map. An isoquant map is another way of describing a production function, just as an indifference map is a way of describ-ing a utility function. Each isoquant corresponds to a different level of output, and the level of output increases as we move up and to the right in the figure.

Isoquants show the flexibility that firms have when making production deci-sions: They can usually obtain a particular output by substituting one input for another. It is important for managers to understand the nature of this flexibil-ity. For example, fast-food restaurants have recently faced shortages of young, low-wage employees. Companies have responded by automating—adding self-service salad bars and introducing more sophisticated cooking equipment. They have also recruited older people to fill positions. As we will see in Chapters 7 and 8, by taking into account this flexibility in the production process, managers can choose input combinations that minimize cost and maximize profit.
Diminishing Marginal Returns
Even though both labor and capital are variable in the long run, it is useful for a firm that is choosing the optimal mix of inputs to ask what happens to output as each input is increased, with the other input held fixed. The outcome of this exer-cise is described in Figure 6.5, which reflects diminishing marginal returns to both labor and capital. We can see why there are diminishing marginal returns to labor by drawing a horizontal line at a particular level of capital—say, 3. Reading the levels of output from each isoquant as labor is increased, we note that each additional unit of labor generates less and less additional output. For example, • isoquant map  Graph

PRODUCTION WITH TWO VARIABLE 
 INPUTS
Production isoquants show the various combina-
tions of inputs necessary for the firm to produce a given output. A set of isoquants, or isoquant 
map, describes the firm’s production function. 
Output  increases as we move from isoquant 
q
1 (at which 55 units per year are produced at 
points such as A and D), to isoquant q2 (75 units 
per year at points such as B), and to isoquant q3 
(90 units per year at points such as C and E).218  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
when labor is increased from 1 unit to 2 (from A to B), output increases by 20 
(from 55 to 75). However, when labor is increased by an additional unit (from B to C), output increases by only 15 (from 75 to 90). Thus there are diminishing 
marginal returns to labor both in the long and short run. Because adding one fac-tor while holding the other factor constant eventually leads to lower and lower incremental output, the isoquant must become steeper as more capital is added in place of labor and flatter when labor is added in place of capital.
There are also diminishing marginal returns to capital. With labor fixed, the mar-
ginal product of capital decreases as capital is increased. For example, when capital is increased from 1 to 2 and labor is held constant at 3, the marginal product of capi-tal is initially 20 (75 – 55) but falls to 15 (90 – 75) when capital is increased from 2 to 3.
Substitution Among Inputs
With two inputs that can be varied, a manager will want to consider substituting one input for another. The slope of each isoquant indicates how the  quantity of one input can be traded off against the quantity of the other, while output is held constant. When the negative sign is removed, we call the slope the  marginal rate of technical 
substitution (MRTS).  The marginal rate of technical substitution of labor for capital  is the 
amount by which the input of capital can be reduced when one extra unit of labor is used, so that output remains constant. This is analogous to the marginal rate of sub-stitution (MRS) in consumer theory. Recall from Section 3.1 that the MRS describes how consumers substitute among two goods while holding the level of satisfaction constant. Like the MRS, the MRTS is always measured as a positive quantity:
MRTS =-Change in capital input/change in labor input
 =-/H9004K//H9004L(for a fixed level of
 q)
where /H9004K and /H9004L are small changes in capital and labor along an isoquant.
In Figure 6.6 the MRTS is equal to 2 when labor increases from 1 unit to 2 and 
output is fixed at 75. However, the MRTS falls to 1 when labor is increased from • marginal rate of technical 
substitution (MRTS)  Amount 
by which the quantity of one input can be reduced when one extra unit of another input is used, so that output remains constant.
In §3.1, we explain that the marginal rate of substitution is the maximum amount of one good that the consumer is willing to give up to obtain one unit of another good.

MARGINAL RATE OF TECHNICAL  
SUBSTITUTION
Like indifference curves, isoquants are down-
ward sloping and convex. The slope of the iso-quant at any point measures the marginal rate of technical substitution—the ability of the firm to replace capital with labor while maintaining the same level of output. On isoquant q
2, the 
MRTS falls from 2 to 1 to 2/3 to 1/3.CHAPTER 6   •  Production  219
2 units to 3, and then declines to 2/3 and to 1/3. Clearly, as more and more labor 
replaces capital, labor becomes less productive and capital becomes relatively more productive. Therefore, we need less capital to keep output constant, and the isoquant becomes flatter.
DIMINISHING MRTS  We assume that there is a diminishing MRTS . In other 
words, the MRTS falls as we move down along an isoquant. The mathemati-cal implication is that isoquants, like indifference curves, are convex , or bowed 
inward. This is indeed the case for most production technologies. The dimin-ishing MRTS tells us that the productivity of any one input is limited. As more and more labor is added to the production process in place of capital, the productivity of labor falls. Similarly, when more capital is added in place of labor, the productivity of capital falls. Production needs a balanced mix of both inputs.
As our discussion has just suggested, the MRTS is closely related to the mar-
ginal products of labor MP
L and capital MPK. To see how, imagine adding some 
labor and reducing the amount of capital sufficient to keep output constant. The additional output resulting from the increased labor input is equal to the addi-tional output per unit of additional labor (the marginal product of labor) times the number of units of additional labor:
Additional output from increased use of labor =(MP
L)(/H9004L)
Similarly, the decrease in output resulting from the reduction in capital is the 
loss of output per unit reduction in capital (the marginal product of capital) times the number of units of capital reduction:
Reduction in output from decreased use of capital =(MP
K)(/H9004K)
Because we are keeping output constant by moving along an isoquant, the total 
change in output must be zero. Thus,
(MP L)(/H9004L)+(MP K)(/H9004K)=0
Now, by rearranging terms we see that (MP
L)/(MP K)=-(/H9004K//H9004L)=MRTS (6.2)
Equation (6.2) tells us that the marginal rate of technical substitution between two 
inputs is equal to the ratio of the marginal products of the inputs . This formula will be 
useful when we look at the firm’s cost-minimizing choice of inputs in Chapter 7.
Production Functions—Two Special Cases
Two extreme cases of production functions show the possible range of input substitution in the production process. In the first case, shown in Figure 6.7, inputs to production are perfect substitutes  for one another. Here the MRTS is 
constant at all points on an isoquant. As a result, the same output (say q
3) can 
be produced with mostly capital (at A), with mostly labor (at C), or with a bal-
anced combination of both (at B). For example, musical instruments can be man-
ufactured almost entirely with machine tools or with very few tools and highly skilled labor.
Figure 6.8 illustrates the opposite extreme, the fixed-proportions produc-
tion function,  sometimes called a Leontief production function . In this case, In §3.1, we explain that an 
indifference curve is convex if the marginal rate of sub-stitution diminishes as we move down along the curve.
In §3.1, we explain that two goods are perfect substi-tutes if the marginal rate of substitution of one for the other is a constant.

it is  impossible to make any substitution among inputs. Each level of output 
requires a specific combination of labor and capital: Additional output cannot be obtained unless more capital and labor are added in specific proportions. As a result, the isoquants are L-shaped, just as indifference curves are L-shaped when two goods are perfect complements. An example is the reconstruction of con-crete sidewalks using jackhammers. It takes one person to use a jackhammer— neither two people and one jackhammer nor one person and two jackhammers will increase production. As another example, suppose that a cereal company offers a new breakfast cereal, Nutty Oat Crunch, whose two inputs, not surpris-ingly, are oats and nuts. The secret formula for the cereal requires exactly one

When the isoquants are L-shaped, only one combination 
of labor and capital can be used to produce a given output (as at point A on isoquant q

not increase output, nor does adding more capital alone.Capital

When the isoquants are straight lines, the MRTS is

combinations that generate the same output q

EXAMPLE 6.4  A PRODUCTION FUNCTION FOR WHEAT
Crops can be produced using dif-
ferent methods. Food grown on large farms in the United States is usually produced with a capi-
tal-intensive technology , which 
involves substantial investments in capital, such as buildings and equipment, and relatively little input of labor. However, food can also be produced using very little capital (a hoe) and a lot of labor (several people with the patience and stamina to work the soil). One way to describe the agricultural production process is to show one iso-quant (or more) that describes the combination of inputs which generates a given level of output (or several output levels). The description that follows comes from a production function for wheat that was estimated statistically.
10Figure 6.9 shows one iso-
quant, associated with the pro-duction function, corresponding to an output of 13,800 bushels of wheat per year. The  manager 
of the farm can use this isoquant to decide whether it is profitable to hire more labor or use more machinery. Assume the farm is 
currently operating at A, with a labor input L of 500 
hours and a capital input K of 100 machine hours. 
The manager decides to experiment by using only 90 hours of machine time. To produce the same crop per year, he finds that he needs to replace this machine time by adding 260 hours of labor.
The results of this experiment tell the manager 
about the shape of the wheat production iso-quant. When he compares points A (where 
10The food production function on which this example is based is given by the equation q = 100( K.8L.2), 
where q is the rate of output in bushels of wheat per year, K is the quantity of machines in use per 
year, and L is the number of hours of labor per year.ounce of nuts for every four ounces of oats in every serving. If the company 
were to purchase additional nuts but not additional oats, the output of cereal would remain unchanged, since the nuts must be combined with the oats in a fixed proportion. Similarly, purchasing additional oats without additional nuts would also be unproductive.
In Figure 6.8 points A, B, and C represent technically efficient combinations 
of inputs. For example, to produce output q
1, a quantity of labor L1 and capital 
K1 can be used, as at A. If capital stays fixed at K1, adding more labor does not 
change output. Nor does adding capital with labor fixed at L1. Thus, on the ver-
tical and the horizontal segments of the L-shaped isoquants, either the marginal product of capital or the marginal product of labor is zero. Higher output results only when both labor and capital are added, as in the move from input combi-nation A to input combination B.
The fixed-proportions production function describes situations in which 
methods of production are limited. For example, the production of a television show might involve a certain mix of capital (camera and sound equipment, etc.) and labor (producer, director, actors, etc.). To make more television shows, all inputs to production must be increased proportionally. In particular, it would be difficult to increase capital inputs at the expense of labor, because actors are necessary inputs to production (except perhaps for animated films). Likewise, it would be difficult to substitute labor for capital, because filmmaking today requires sophisticated film equipment.In §3.1, we explain that two 
goods are perfect comple-ments when the indifference curves for the goods are shaped as right angles.222  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
L /H11005 500 and K /H11005 100) and B (where L /H11005 760 and 
K /H11005 90) in Figure 6.9, both of which are on the 
same  isoquant, the manager finds that the mar-
ginal rate of technical substitution is equal to  
0.04 (− /H9004K//H9004L /H11005 /H11002(/H1100210)/260 /H11005 .04).
The MRTS reveals the nature of the trade-off 
involved in adding labor and reducing the use of farm machinery. Because the MRTS is substantially less than 1 in value, the manager knows that when the wage of a laborer is equal to the cost of running a machine, he ought to use more capital. (At his current level of production, he needs 260 units of labor to substitute for 10 units of capital.) In fact, he knows that unless labor is much less expensive than the use of a machine, his production process ought to become more capital-intensive.The decision about how many laborers to hire 
and machines to use cannot be fully resolved until we discuss the costs of production in the next chapter. However, this example illustrates how knowledge about production isoquants and the marginal rate of technical substitution can help a manager. It also suggests why most farms in the United States and Canada, where labor is relatively expensive, operate in the range of production in which the MRTS is relatively high (with a high cap-ital-to-labor ratio), whereas farms in developing countries, in which labor is cheap, operate with a lower MRTS (and a lower capital-to-labor ratio).
11 
The exact labor/capital combination to use depends on input prices, a subject that we discuss in Chapter 7.
11With the production function given in footnote 6, it is not difficult (using calculus) to show 
that the marginal rate of technical substitution is given by MRTS /H11005 (MPL/MPK) /H11005 (1/4)
(K/L). Thus, the MRTS decreases as the capital-to-labor ratio falls. For an interesting study of 
 agricultural production in Israel, see Richard E. Just, David Zilberman, and Eithan Hochman, “Estimation of Multicrop Production Functions,” American Journal of Agricultural Economics  65

6.4  Returns to Scale
Our analysis of input substitution in the production process has shown us what 
happens when a firm substitutes one input for another while keeping output constant. However, in the long run, with all inputs variable, the firm must also  consider the best way to increase output. One way to do so is to change the scale  of the operation by increasing all of the inputs to production in proportion . If 
it takes one farmer working with one harvesting machine on one acre of land to produce 100 bushels of wheat, what will happen to output if we put two farmers to work with two machines on two acres of land? Output will almost certainly increase, but will it double, more than double, or less than double? Returns to 
scale  is the rate at which output increases as inputs are increased proportion-
ately. We will examine three different cases: increasing, constant, and decreasing returns to scale.
INCREASING RETURNS TO SCALE  If output more than doubles when inputs 
are doubled, there are increasing returns to scale.  This might arise because 
the larger scale of operation allows managers and workers to specialize in their tasks and to make use of more sophisticated, large-scale factories and equipment. The automobile assembly line is a famous example of increasing returns.
The prospect of increasing returns to scale is an important issue from a public- 
policy perspective. If there are increasing returns, then it is economically advan-tageous to have one large firm producing (at relatively low cost) rather than to have many small firms (at relatively high cost). Because this large firm can control the price that it sets, it may need to be regulated. For example, increasing returns in the provision of electricity is one reason why we have large, regulated power companies.
CONSTANT RETURNS TO SCALE  A second possibility with respect to the 
scale of production is that output may double when inputs are doubled. In this case, we say there are constant returns to scale.  With constant returns to scale, 
the size of the firm’s operation does not affect the productivity of its factors: Because one plant using a particular production process can easily be repli-cated, two plants produce twice as much output. For example, a large travel agency might provide the same service per client and use the same ratio of capital (office space) and labor (travel agents) as a small agency that services fewer clients.
DECREASING RETURNS TO SCALE  Finally, output may less than double 
when all inputs double. This case of decreasing returns to scale  applies to some 
firms with large-scale operations. Eventually, difficulties in organizing and run-ning a large-scale operation may lead to decreased productivity of both labor and capital. Communication between workers and managers can become dif-ficult to monitor as the workplace becomes more impersonal. Thus, the decreas-ing-returns case is likely to be associated with the problems of coordinating tasks and maintaining a useful line of communication between management and workers.• returns to scale  Rate at

RETURNS TO SCALE
When a firm’s production process exhibits constant returns to scale as shown by a movement 
along line 0 A in part (a), the isoquants are equally spaced as output increases proportionally. 
However, when there are increasing returns to scale as shown in  (b), the isoquants move closer 
together as inputs are increased along the line.
Describing Returns to Scale
Returns to scale need not be uniform across all possible levels of output. For 
example, at lower levels of output, the firm could have increasing returns to scale, but constant and eventually decreasing returns at higher levels of output.
The presence or absence of returns to scale is seen graphically in the two parts of 
Figure 6.10. The line 0 A from the origin in each panel describes a  production pro-
cess in which labor and capital are used as inputs to produce various levels of out-put in the ratio of 5 hours of labor to 2 hours of machine time. In Figure 6.10 (a), the firm’s production function exhibits constant returns to scale. When 5 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time are used, an output of 10 units is produced. When both inputs double, output doubles from 10 to 20 units; when both inputs triple, 
output triples, from 10 to 30 units. Put differently, twice as much of both inputs is needed to produce 20 units, and three times as much is needed to produce 30 units.
In Figure 6.10 (b), the firm’s production function exhibits increasing returns 
to scale. Now the isoquants come closer together as we move away from the origin along 0 A. As a result, less than twice the amount of both inputs is needed 
to increase production from 10 units to 20; substantially less than three times the inputs are needed to produce 30 units. The reverse would be true if the pro-duction function exhibited decreasing returns to scale (not shown here). With decreasing returns, the isoquants are increasingly distant from one another as output levels increase proportionally.
Returns to scale vary considerably across firms and industries. Other things 
being equal, the greater the returns to scale, the larger the firms in an industry are likely to be. Because manufacturing involves large investments in capital equip-ment, manufacturing industries are more likely to have increasing returns to scale than service-oriented industries. Services are more labor-intensive and can usually be provided as efficiently in small quantities as they can on a large scale.CHAPTER 6   •  Production  225
EXAMPLE 6.5  RETURNS TO SCALE IN THE CARPET INDUSTRY
The carpet industry in the United 
States centers on the town of Dalton in northern Georgia. From a relatively small industry with many small firms in the first half of the twentieth century, it grew rap-idly and became a major industry with a large number of firms of all sizes. For example, the top five carpet manufacturers, ranked by shipments in millions of dollars in 2005, are shown in Table 6.5.
12
Currently, there are three rela-
tively large manufacturers (Shaw, Mohawk, and Beaulieu), along with a number of smaller produc-ers. There are also many retailers, wholesale distributors, buying groups, and national retail chains. The carpet indus-try has grown rapidly for several reasons. Consumer demand for wool, nylon, and polypropylene carpets in commercial and residential uses has skyrocketed. In addition, innovations such as the introduction of larger, faster, and more efficient carpet-tufting machines have reduced costs and greatly increased carpet production. Along with the increase in pro-duction, innovation and competition have worked together to reduce real carpet prices.
To what extent, if any, can the growth of the 
carpet industry be explained by the presence of returns to scale? There have certainly been  substantial improvements in the processing of 
key production inputs (such as stain-resistant yarn) and in the distribution of carpets 
to retailers and  consumers. But 
what about the production of car-pets? Carpet production is capital intensive—manufacturing plants require heavy investments in high-speed tufting machines that turn various types of yarn into car-pet, as well as machines that put the backings onto the carpets, cut the carpets into appropriate sizes, and package, label, and distrib-ute them.
Overall, physical capital 
(including plant and equipment) accounts for about 77 percent of a typical carpet manufacturer’s costs, while labor accounts for the 
remaining 23 percent. Over time, the major carpet manufacturers have increased the scale of their operations by putting larger and more efficient tuft-ing machines into larger plants. At the same time, the use of labor in these plants has also increased significantly. The result? Proportional increases in inputs have resulted in a more than proportional increase in output for these larger plants. For exam-ple, a doubling of capital and labor inputs might lead to a 110-percent increase in output. This pat-tern has not, however, been uniform across the industry. Most smaller carpet manufacturers have found that small changes in scale have little or no effect on output; i.e., small proportional increases in inputs have only increased output proportionally.

ing marginal returns to labor in the short run?

on an assembly line. Are you more concerned with the average product of labor or the marginal product of labor for the last person hired? If you observe that your average product is just beginning to decline, should you hire any more workers? What does this situation imply about the marginal product of your last worker hired?

 6. Faced with constantly changing conditions, why 
would a firm ever keep any factors fixed? What criteria

 9. Explain the term “marginal rate of technical substitu-
tion.” What does a MRTS  /H11005 4 mean?
 10. Explain why the marginal rate of technical substitu-
tion is likely to diminish as more and more labor is substituted for capital.
 11. Is it possible to have diminishing returns to a single 
factor of production and constant returns to scale at the same time? Discuss.
 12. Can a firm have a production function that exhibits 
increasing returns to scale, constant returns to scale, and decreasing returns to scale as output increases? Discuss.
 13. Suppose that output q is a function of a single input, 
labor ( L). Describe the returns to scale associated 
with each of the following production functions:  
1a2 q=L/2 1b2 q=L
2+L 1c2 q=log1L2.SUMMARY
 1. A production function  describes the maximum output 
that a firm can produce for each specified combination of inputs.
 2. In the short run, one or more inputs to the production 
process are fixed. In the long run, all inputs are poten-tially variable.
 3. Production with one variable input, labor, can be use-
fully described in terms of the average product of labor  
(which measures output per unit of labor input) and the marginal product of labor  (which measures the addi-
tional output as labor is increased by 1 unit).
 4. According to the law of diminishing marginal returns , 
when one or more inputs are fixed, a variable input (usually labor) is likely to have a marginal product that eventually diminishes as the level of input increases.
 5. An isoquant  is a curve that shows all combinations of 
inputs that yield a given level of output. A firm’s pro-duction function can be represented by a series of iso-quants associated with different levels of output.
 6. Isoquants always slope downward because the mar-
ginal product of all inputs is positive. The shape of each isoquant can be described by the marginal rate of technical substitution at each point on the isoquant. 
The marginal rate of technical substitution of labor for capi-
tal (MRTS) is the amount by which the input of capital 
can be reduced when one extra unit of labor is used so that output remains constant.
 7. The standard of living that a country can attain for 
its citizens is closely related to its level of labor pro-ductivity. Decreases in the rate of productivity growth in developed countries are due in part to the lack of 
growth of capital investment.
 8. The possibilities for substitution among inputs in the 
production process range from a production function in which inputs are perfect substitutes  to one in which 
the proportions of inputs to be used are fixed (a fixed-
proportions production function ).
 9. In long-run analysis, we tend to focus on the firm’s 
choice of its scale or size of operation. Constant returns 
to scale  means that doubling all inputs leads to dou-
bling output. Increasing returns to scale  occurs when 
output more than doubles when inputs are doubled; decreasing returns to scale  applies when output less than 
doubles.We can therefore characterize the carpet indus-
try as one in which there are constant returns to scale for relatively small plants but increasing returns to scale for larger plants. These increasing returns, however, are limited, and we can expect 
that if plant size were increased further, there would eventually be decreasing returns to scale.CHAPTER 6   •  Production  227

In the last chapter, we examined the firm’s production technology—
the relationship that shows how factor inputs can be transformed into outputs. Now we will see how the production technology, 
together with the prices of factor inputs, determines the firm’s cost of production.
Given a firm’s production technology, managers must decide how to 
produce. As we saw, inputs can be combined in different ways to yield the same amount of output. For example, one can produce a certain output with a lot of labor and very little capital, with very little labor and a lot of capital, or with some other combination of the two. In this chapter we see how the optimal —i.e., cost-minimizing—combination 
of inputs is chosen. We will also see how a firm’s costs depend on its rate of output and show how these costs are likely to change over time.
We begin by explaining how cost is defined and measured, distin-
guishing between the concept of cost used by economists, who are concerned about the firm’s future performance, and by accountants, who focus on the firm’s financial statements. We then examine how the characteristics of the firm’s production technology affect costs, both in the short run, when the firm can do little to change its capital stock, and in the long run, when the firm can change all its factor inputs.
We then show how the concept of returns to scale can be general-
ized to allow for both changes in the mix of inputs and the produc-tion of many different outputs. We also show how cost sometimes falls over time as managers and workers learn from experience and make production processes more efficient. Finally, we show how empirical information can be used to estimate cost functions and pre-dict future costs.
7.1   Measuring Cost: Which Costs 
Matter?
Before we can analyze how firms minimize costs, we must clarify what 
we mean by cost in the first place and how we should measure it. What 
items, for example, should be included as part of a firm’s cost? Cost obviously includes the wages that a firm pays its workers and the rent that it pays for office space. But what if the firm already owns an 7.1

office building and doesn’t have to pay rent? How should we treat money that 
the firm spent two or three years ago (and can’t recover) for equipment or for research and development? We’ll answer questions such as these in the context of the economic decisions that managers make.
Economic Cost versus Accounting Cost
Economists think of cost differently from financial accountants, who are usually concerned with keeping track of assets and liabilities and reporting past perfor-mance for external use, as in annual reports. Financial accountants tend to take a retrospective view of the firm’s finances and operations. As a result account-
ing cost —the cost that financial accountants measure—can include items that 
an economist would not include and may not include items that economists usually do include. For example, accounting cost includes actual expenses plus depreciation expenses for capital equipment, which are determined on the basis of the allowable tax treatment by the Internal Revenue Service.
Economists—and we hope managers—take a forward-looking view. They 
are concerned with the allocation of scarce resources. Therefore, they care about what cost is likely to be in the future and about ways in which the firm might be able to rearrange its resources to lower its costs and improve its profitability. As we will see, economists are therefore concerned with economic cost,  which is 
the cost of utilizing resources in production. What kinds of resources are part of economic cost? The word economic  tells us to distinguish between the costs the 
firm can control and those it cannot. It also tells us to consider all costs relevant 
to production. Clearly capital, labor, and raw materials are resources whose costs should be included. But the firm might use other resources with costs that are less obvious, but equally important. Here the concept of opportunity cost plays an important role.
Opportunity Cost
Opportunity cost  is the cost associated with opportunities that are forgone 
by not putting the firm’s resources to their best alternative use. This is easi-est to understand through an example. Consider a firm that owns a build-ing and therefore pays no rent for office space. Does this mean the cost of office space is zero? The firm’s managers and accountant might say yes, but an economist would disagree. The economist would note that the firm could have earned rent on the office space by leasing it to another company. Leasing the office space would mean putting this resource to an alternative use, a use that would have provided the firm with rental income. This forgone rent is the opportunity cost of utilizing the office space. And because the office space is a resource that the firm is utilizing, this opportunity cost is also an economic cost of doing business.
What about the wages and salaries paid to the firm’s workers? This is clearly 
an economic cost of doing business, but if you think about it, you will see that it is also an opportunity cost. The reason is that the money paid to the workers could have been put to some alternative use instead. Perhaps the firm could have used some or all of that money to buy more labor-saving machines, or even to produce a different product altogether. Thus we see that economic cost and opportunity cost actually boil down to the same thing. As long as we account for and measure all of the firm’s resources properly, we will find that:
Economic cost /H11549Opportunit
y cost• accounting cost  Actual 
expenses plus depreciation charges for capital equipment.
• economic cost  Cost to 
a firm of utilizing economic resources in production.
• opportunity cost  Cost 
associated with opportunities forgone when a firm’s resources are not put to their best alternative use.CHAPTER 7   •  The Cost of Production  231
While economic cost and opportunity cost both describe the same thing, the 
concept of opportunity cost is particularly useful in situations where alternatives that are forgone do not reflect monetary outlays. Let’s take a more detailed look at opportunity cost to see how it can make economic cost differ from account-ing cost in the treatment of wages, and then in the cost of production inputs. Consider an owner that manages her own retail toy store and does not pay her-self a salary. (We’ll put aside the rent that she pays for the office space just to simplify the discussion.) Had our toy store owner chosen to work elsewhere she would have been able to find a job that paid $60,000 per year for essentially the same effort. In this case the opportunity cost of the time she spends working in her toy store business is $60,000.
Now suppose that last year she acquired an inventory of toys for which she 
paid $1 million. She hopes to be able to sell those toys during the holiday season for a substantial markup over her acquisition cost. However, early in the fall she receives an offer from another toy retailer to acquire her inventory for $1.5 million. Should she sell her inventory or not? The answer depends in part on her business prospects, but it also depends on the opportunity cost of acquir-ing a toy inventory. Assuming that it would cost $1.5 million to acquire the new inventory all over again, the opportunity cost of keeping it is $1.5 million, not the $1.0 million she originally paid.
You might ask why the opportunity cost isn’t just $500,000, since that is the 
difference between the market value of the inventory and the cost of its acquisi-tion. The key is that when the owner is deciding what to do with the inventory, she is deciding what is best for her business in the future. To do so, she needs to account for the fact that if she keeps the inventory for her own use, she would be sacrificing the $1.5 million that she could have received by selling the inventory to another firm.
1
Note that an accountant may not see things this way. The accountant might 
tell the toy store owner that the cost of utilizing the inventory is just the $1 mil-lion that she paid for it. But we hope that you understand why this would be misleading. The actual economic cost of keeping and utilizing that inventory is the $1.5 million that the owner could have obtained by instead selling it to another retailer.
Accountants and economists will also sometimes differ in their treatment of 
depreciation. When estimating the future profitability of a business, economists and managers are concerned with the capital cost of plant and machinery. This cost involves not only the monetary outlay for buying and then running the machinery, but also the cost associated with wear and tear. When evaluating past performance, cost accountants use tax rules that apply to broadly defined types of assets to determine allowable depreciation in their cost and profit calcu-lations. But these depreciation allowances need not reflect the actual wear and tear on the equipment, which is likely to vary asset by asset.
Sunk Costs
Although an opportunity cost is often hidden, it should be taken into account when making economic decisions. Just the opposite is true of a sunk cost:  an 
expenditure that has been made and cannot be recovered. A sunk cost is usually • sunk cost  Expenditure that 
has been made and cannot be recovered.
1Of course, opportunity cost will change from circumstance to circumstance and from one time 
period to the next. If the value of our retailer’s inventory suddenly increased to $1.7 million because that inventory included some holiday products that were in great demand, the opportunity cost of keeping and using the inventory would increase to $1.7 million.232  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
visible, but after it has been incurred it should always be ignored when making 
future economic decisions.
Because a sunk cost cannot be recovered, it should not influence the firm’s 
decisions. For example, consider the purchase of specialized equipment for a plant. Suppose the equipment can be used to do only what it was originally designed for and cannot be converted for alternative use. The expenditure on this equipment is a sunk cost. Because it has no alternative use, its opportunity cost 
is zero.  Thus it should not be included as part of the firm’s economic costs. The 
decision to buy this equipment may have been good or bad. It doesn’t matter. It’s water under the bridge and shouldn’t affect current decisions.
What if, instead, the equipment could be put to other use or could be sold 
or rented to another firm? In that case, its use would involve an economic cost—namely, the opportunity cost of using it rather than selling or renting it to another firm.
Now consider a prospective  sunk cost. Suppose, for example, that the firm has 
not yet bought the specialized equipment but is merely considering whether to do so. A prospective sunk cost is an investment.  Here the firm must decide 
whether that investment in specialized equipment is economical —i.e., whether it 
will lead to a flow of revenues large enough to justify its cost. In Chapter 15, we explain in detail how to make investment decisions of this kind.
As an example, suppose a firm is considering moving its headquarters to a 
new city. Last year it paid $500,000 for an option to buy a building in the city. The option gives the firm the right to buy the building at a cost of $5,000,000, so that if it ultimately makes the purchase its total expenditure will be $5,500,000. Now it finds that a comparable building has become available in the same city at a price of $5,250,000. Which building should it buy? The answer is the origi-nal building. The $500,000 option is a cost that has been sunk and thus should not affect the firm’s current decision. What’s at issue is spending an additional $5,000,000 or an additional $5,250,000. Because the economic analysis removes the sunk cost of the option from the analysis, the economic cost of the original property is $5,000,000. The newer property, meanwhile, has an economic cost of $5,250,000. Of course, if the new building costs $4,900,000, the firm should buy it and forgo its option.
EXAMPLE 7.1  CHOOSING THE LOCATION FOR A NEW LAW 
SCHOOL BUILDING
The Northwestern University Law School has long 
been located in Chicago, along the shores of Lake Michigan. However, the main campus of the uni-versity is located in the suburb of Evanston. In the mid-1970s, the law school began planning the con-struction of a new building and needed to decide on an appropriate location. Should it be built on the current site, where it would remain near down-town Chicago law firms? Or should it be moved to Evanston, where it would be physically integrated with the rest of the university?The downtown location had many prominent 
supporters. They argued in part that it was cost-effective to locate the new building in the city because the university already owned the land. A large parcel of land would have to be purchased in Evanston if the building were to be built there. Does this argument make economic sense?
No. It makes the common mistake of failing to 
appreciate opportunity cost. From an economic point of view, it is very expensive to locate down-town because the opportunity cost of the  valuable CHAPTER 7   •  The Cost of Production  233
Fixed Costs and Variable Costs
Some costs vary with output, while others remain unchanged as long as the 
firm is producing any output at all. This distinction will be important when we examine the firm’s profit-maximizing choice of output in the next chapter. We therefore divide total cost (TC or C)—the total economic cost of production—
into two components.
• Fixed cost (FC):  A cost that does not vary with the level of output and that can 
be eliminated only by going out of business.
• Variable cost (VC):  A cost that varies as output varies.
Depending on circumstances, fixed costs may include expenditures for plant 
maintenance, insurance, heat and electricity, and perhaps a minimal number of employees. They remain the same no matter how much output the firm pro-duces. Variable costs, which include expenditures for wages, salaries, and raw materials used for production, increase as output increases.
Fixed cost does not vary with the level of output—it must be paid even if 
there is no output. The only way that a firm can eliminate its fixed costs is by shutting 
down.
SHUTTING DOWN  Shutting down doesn’t necessarily mean going out of busi-
ness. Suppose a clothing company owns several factories, is experiencing declin-ing demand, and wants to reduce output and costs as much as possible at one factory. By reducing the output of that factory to zero, the company could elimi-nate the costs of raw materials and much of the labor, but it would still incur the fixed costs of paying the factory’s managers, security guards, and ongoing maintenance. The only way to eliminate those fixed costs would be to close the doors, turn off the electricity, and perhaps even sell off or scrap the machinery. The company would still remain in business and could operate its remaining factories. It might even be able to re-open the factory it had closed, although doing so could be costly if it involved buying new machinery or refurbishing the old machinery.
FIXED OR VARIABLE?  How do we know which costs are fixed and which are 
variable? The answer depends on the time horizon that we are considering. Over a very short time horizon—say, a few months—most costs are fixed. Over such a short period, a firm is usually obligated to pay for contracted shipments of materials and cannot easily lay off workers, no matter how much or how little the firm produces.
On the other hand, over a longer time period—say, two or three years—many 
costs become variable. Over this time horizon, if the firm wants to reduce its output, it can reduce its workforce, purchase fewer raw materials, and perhaps even sell off some of its machinery. Over a very long time horizon—say, ten • total cost (TC or C) Total

• fixed cost (FC)  Cost that

• variable cost (VC)  Cost that 
varies as output varies.lakeshore location is high: That property could have 
been sold for enough money to buy the Evanston land with substantial funds left over.
In the end, Northwestern decided to keep the 
law school in Chicago. This was a costly deci-sion. It may have been appropriate if the Chicago  
location was particularly valuable to the law school, but it was inappropriate if it was made on the presumption that the downtown land had no cost.234  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
years—nearly all costs are variable. Workers and managers can be laid off (or 
employment can be reduced by attrition), and much of the machinery can be sold off or not replaced as it becomes obsolete and is scrapped.
Knowing which costs are fixed and which are variable is important for the 
management of a firm. When a firm plans to increase or decrease its produc-tion, it will want to know how that change will affect its costs. Consider, for example, a problem that Delta Air Lines faced. Delta wanted to know how its costs would change if it reduced the number of its scheduled flights by 10 per-cent. The answer depends on whether we are considering the short run or the long run. Over the short run—say six months—schedules are fixed and it is dif-ficult to lay off or discharge workers. As a result, most of Delta’s short-run costs are fixed and won’t be reduced significantly with the flight reduction. In the long run—say two years or more—the situation is quite different. Delta has suf-ficient time to sell or lease planes that are not needed and to discharge unneeded workers. In this case, most of Delta’s costs are variable and thus can be reduced significantly if a 10-percent flight reduction is put in place.
Fixed versus Sunk Costs
People often confuse fixed and sunk costs. As we just explained, fixed costs are costs that are paid by a firm that is operating, regardless of the level of output it produces. Such costs can include, for example, the salaries of the key execu-tives and expenses for their office space and support staff, as well as insurance and the costs of plant maintenance. Fixed costs can be avoided if the firm shuts down a plant or goes out of business—the key executives and their support staff, for example, will no longer be needed.
Sunk costs, on the other hand, are costs that have been incurred and cannot 
be recovered.  An example is the cost of R&D to a pharmaceutical company to 
develop and test a new drug and then, if the drug has been proven to be safe and effective, the cost of marketing it. Whether the drug is a success or a failure, these costs cannot be recovered and thus are sunk. Another example is the cost of a chip-fabrication plant to produce microprocessors for use in computers. Because the plant’s equipment is too specialized to be of use in any other indus-try, most if not all of this expenditure is sunk, i.e., cannot be recovered. (Some small part of the cost might be recovered if the equipment is sold for scrap.)
Suppose, on the other hand, that a firm had agreed to make annual payments 
into an employee retirement plan as long as the firm was in operation, regardless of its output or its profitability. These payments could cease only if the firm went out of business. In this case, the payments should be viewed as a fixed cost.
Why distinguish between fixed and sunk costs? Because fixed costs affect the 
firm’s decisions looking forward, whereas sunk costs do not. Fixed costs that are high relative to revenue and cannot be reduced might lead a firm to shut down—eliminating those fixed costs and earning zero profit might be better than incurring ongoing losses. Incurring a high sunk cost might later turn out to be a bad decision (for example, the unsuccessful development of a new prod-uct), but the expenditure is gone and cannot be recovered by shutting down. Of course a prospective  sunk cost is different and, as we mentioned earlier, would 
certainly affect the firm’s decisions looking forward. (Should the firm, for exam-ple, undertake the development of that new product?)
AMORTIZING SUNK COSTS  In practice, many firms don’t always distin-
guish between sunk and fixed costs. For example, the semiconductor company that spent $600 million for a chip-fabrication plant (clearly a sunk cost) might CHAPTER 7   •  The Cost of Production  235
amortize  the expenditure over six years and treat it as a fixed cost of $100 
 million per year. This is fine as long as the firm’s managers understand that shutting down will not make the $100 million annual cost go away. In fact, amortizing capital expenditures this way—spreading them out over many years and treating them as fixed costs—can be a useful way of evaluating the firm’s long-term profitability.
Amortizing large capital expenditures and treating them as ongoing fixed 
costs can also simplify the economic analysis of a firm’s operation. As we will see, for example, treating capital expenditures this way can make it easier to understand the tradeoff that a firm faces in its use of labor versus capital. For simplicity, we will usually treat sunk costs in this way as we examine the firm’s production decisions. When distinguishing sunk from fixed costs does become essential to the economic analysis, we will let you know.• amortization  Policy of 
treating a one-time expenditure as an annual cost spread out over some number of years.
EXAMPLE 7.2  SUNK, FIXED, AND VARIABLE COSTS: COMPUTERS, 
SOFTWARE, AND PIZZAS
As you progress through this book, you will see that 
a firm’s pricing and production decisions—and its profitability—depend strongly on the structure of its costs. It is therefore important for managers to understand the characteristics of production costs and to be able to identify which costs are fixed, which are variable, and which are sunk. The rela-tive sizes of these different cost components can vary considerably across industries. Good examples include the personal computer industry (where most costs are variable), the computer software industry (where most costs are sunk), and the pizzeria busi-ness (where most costs are fixed). Let’s look at each of these in turn.
Companies like Dell, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard, 
and IBM produce millions of personal computers every year. Because computers are very similar, com-petition is intense, and profitability depends criti-cally on the ability to keep costs down. Most of these costs are variable—they increase in proportion to the number of computers produced each year. Most important is the cost of components: the micropro-cessor that does much of the actual computation, memory chips, hard disk drives and other storage devices, video and sound cards, etc. Typically, the majority of these components are purchased from outside suppliers in quantities that depend on the number of computers to be produced.
Another important variable cost is labor: Workers 
are needed to assemble computers and then pack-age and ship them. There is little in the way of sunk costs because factories cost little relative to the 
value of the company’s annual output. Likewise, there is little in the way of fixed costs—perhaps the salaries of the top executives, some security guards, and electricity. Thus, when Dell and Hewlett-Packard think about ways of reducing cost, they focus largely on getting better prices for components or reduc-ing labor requirements—both of which are ways of reducing variable cost.
What about the software programs that run on 
these personal computers? Microsoft produces the Windows operating system as well as a variety of applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. But many other firms—some large and some small—also produce software programs that run on personal computers. For such firms, production costs are quite different from those facing hardware manufacturers. In software production, most costs are sunk.  Typically, a software firm will spend a large 
amount of money to develop a new application pro-gram. These expenditures cannot be recovered.
Once the program is completed, the company 
can try to recoup its investment (and make a profit as well) by selling as many copies of the program as possible. The variable cost of producing copies of the program is very small—largely the cost of copying the program to CDs and then packaging and shipping the product. Likewise, the fixed cost of production is small. Because most costs are sunk, entering the software business can involve consider-able risk. Until the development money has been 236  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
Marginal and Average Cost
To complete our discussion of costs, we now turn to the distinction between 
marginal and average cost. In explaining this distinction, we use a specific numerical example of a cost function (the relationship between cost and output) that typifies the cost situation of many firms. The example is shown in Table 7.1. After we explain the concepts of marginal and average cost, we will consider how the analysis of costs differs between the short run and the long run.
MARGINAL COST (MC)  Marginal cost —sometimes called incremental cost —is 
the increase in cost that results from producing one extra unit of output. Because fixed cost does not change as the firm’s level of output changes, marginal cost is

in cost resulting from the production of one extra unit of output.spent and the product has been released for sale, 
an entrepreneur is unlikely to know how many cop-ies can be sold and whether or not he will be able to make money.
Finally, let’s turn to your neighborhood pizzeria. 
For the pizzeria, the largest component of cost is fixed. Sunk costs are fairly low because pizza ovens, chairs, tables, and dishes can be resold if the piz-zeria goes out of business. Variable costs are also fairly low—mainly the ingredients for pizza (flour, tomato sauce, cheese, and pepperoni for a typical 
large pizza might cost $1 or $2) and perhaps wages for a couple of workers to help produce, serve, and deliver pizzas. Most of the cost is fixed—the oppor-tunity cost of the owner’s time (he might typically work a 60- or 70-hour week), rent, and utilities. Because of these high fixed costs, most pizzerias (which might charge $12 for a large pizza costing about $3 in variable cost to produce) don’t make very high profits.

equal to the increase in variable cost or the increase in total cost that results from 
an extra unit of output. We can therefore write marginal cost as
MC=/H9004VC/ /H9004q=/H9004TC/ /H9004q
Marginal cost tells us how much it will cost to expand output by one unit. In 
Table 7.1, marginal cost is calculated from either the variable cost (column 2) or the total cost (column 3). For example, the marginal cost of increasing output from 2 to 3 units is $20 because the variable cost of the firm increases from $78 to $98. (The total cost of production also increases by $20, from $128 to $148. Total cost differs from variable cost only by the fixed cost, which by definition does not change as output changes.)
AVERAGE TOTAL COST (ATC)  Average total cost,  used interchangeably with 
AC and average economic cost , is the firm’s total cost divided by its level of output, 
TC/ q. Thus the average total cost of producing at a rate of five units is $36—that 
is, $180/5. Basically, average total cost tells us the per-unit cost of production.
ATC has two components. Average fixed cost (AFC)  is the fixed cost (column 
1 of Table 7.1) divided by the level of output, FC/ q. For example, the average 
fixed cost of producing 4 units of output is $12.50 ($50/4). Because fixed cost is constant, average fixed cost declines as the rate of output increases. Average 
variable cost (AVC)  is variable cost divided by the level of output, VC/ q. The 
average variable cost of producing 5 units of output is $26—that is, $130/5.
We have now discussed all of the different types of costs that are relevant to 
production decisions in both competitive and non-competitive markets. Now we turn to how costs differ in the short run versus the long run. This is particu-larly important for fixed costs. Costs that are fixed in the very short run, e.g., the wages of employees under fixed-term contracts—may not be fixed over a longer time horizon. Similarly, the fixed capital costs of plant and equipment become variable if the time horizon is sufficiently long to allow the firm to purchase new equipment and build a new plant. Fixed costs, however, need not disap-pear, even in the long run. Suppose, for example, that a firm has been contribut-ing to an employee retirement program. Its obligations, which are fixed in part, may remain even in the long run; they might only disappear if the firm were to declare bankruptcy.
7.2  Cost in the Short Run
In this section we focus our attention on short-run costs. We turn to long-run costs in Section 7.3.
The Determinants of Short-Run Cost
The data in Table 7.1 show how variable and total costs increase with output in the short run. The rate at which these costs increase depends on the nature of the production process and, in particular, on the extent to which production involves diminishing marginal returns to variable factors. Recall from Chapter 6 that diminishing marginal returns to labor occur when the marginal product of labor is decreasing. If labor is the only input, what happens as we increase the firm’s output? To produce more output, the firm must hire more labor. Then, if the marginal product of labor decreases as the amount of labor hired is increased (owing to diminishing returns), successively greater expenditures must be made • average total cost 
(ATC)  Firm’s total cost divided 
by its level of output.
• average fixed cost 
(AFC)  Fixed cost divided by 
the level of output.
• average variable cost 
(AVC)  Variable cost divided by 
the level of output.
In §6.2, we explain that diminishing marginal returns occurs when additional inputs result in decreasing additions to output.238  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
to produce output at the higher rate. As a result, variable and total costs increase 
as the rate of output is increased. On the other hand, if the marginal product of labor decreases only slightly as the amount of labor is increased, costs will not rise so quickly when the rate of output is increased.
2
Let’s look at the relationship between production and cost in more detail by 
concentrating on the costs of a firm that can hire as much labor as it wishes at a fixed wage w. Recall that marginal cost MC is the change in variable cost for a 
1-unit change in output (i.e., /H9004VC/ /H9004q). But the change in variable cost is the per-
unit cost of the extra labor w times the amount of extra labor needed to produce 
the extra output /H9004L. Because /H9004VC/H11005w/H9004L, it follows that
MC=/H9004VC/ /H9004q=w/H9004L//H9004q
Recall from Chapter 6 that the marginal product of labor MP
L is the change in out-
put resulting from a 1-unit change in labor input, or /H9004q//H9004L. Therefore, the extra 
labor needed to obtain an extra unit of output is /H9004L//H9004q /H11005 1/MPL. As a result,
 MC =w/MP L (7.1)
Equation (7.1) states that when there is only one variable input, the marginal 
cost is equal to the price of the input divided by its marginal product. Suppose, for example, that the marginal product of labor is 3 and the wage rate is $30 per hour. In that case, 1 hour of labor will increase output by 3 units, so that 1 unit of output will require 1/3 additional hour of labor and will cost $10. The mar-ginal cost of producing that unit of output is $10, which is equal to the wage, $30, divided by the marginal product of labor, 3. A low marginal product of labor means that a large amount of additional labor is needed to produce more  output—a fact that leads, in turn, to a high marginal cost. Conversely, a high marginal product means that the labor requirement is low, as is the marginal cost. More generally, whenever the marginal product of labor decreases, the marginal cost of production increases, and vice versa.
3
DIMINISHING MARGINAL RETURNS AND MARGINAL COST  Diminishing 
marginal returns means that the marginal product of labor declines as the quantity of labor employed increases. As a result, when there are diminishing marginal returns, marginal cost will increase as output increases. This can be seen by looking at the numbers for marginal cost in Table 7.1. For output levels from 0 through 4, marginal cost is declining; for output levels from 4 through 11, however, marginal cost is increasing—a reflection of the presence of diminishing marginal returns.
The Shapes of the Cost Curves
Figure 7.1 illustrates how various cost measures change as output changes. The top part of the figure shows total cost and its two components, variable cost and fixed cost; the bottom part shows marginal cost and average costs. These cost curves, which are based on the information in Table 7.1, provide different kinds of information.The marginal product of 
labor is discussed in §6.2.
2We are implicitly assuming that because labor is hired in competitive markets, the payment per unit 
of labor used is the same regardless of the firm’s output.
3With two or more variable inputs, the relationship is more complex. The basic principle, however, 
still holds: The greater the productivity of factors, the less the variable cost that the firm must incur to produce any given level of output.CHAPTER 7   •  The Cost of Production  239
Observe in Figure 7.1 (a) that fixed cost FC does not vary with output—it is 
shown as a horizontal line at $50. Variable cost VC is zero when output is zero and then increases continuously as output increases. The total cost curve TC is deter-mined by vertically adding the fixed cost curve to the variable cost curve. Because fixed cost is constant, the vertical distance between the two curves is always $50.
Figure 7.1 (b) shows the corresponding set of marginal and average variable 
cost curves.
4 Because total fixed cost is $50, the average fixed cost curve AFC 
falls continuously from $50 when output is 1, toward zero for large output. The shapes of the remaining curves are determined by the relationship between the marginal and average cost curves. Whenever marginal cost lies below average cost, the average cost curve falls. Whenever marginal cost lies above average cost, the average cost curve rises. When average cost is at a minimum, marginal cost equals average cost.

COST CURVES FOR A FIRM
In (a) total cost TC is the vertical 
sum of fixed cost FC and vari-able cost VC. In (b) average total 
cost ATC is the sum of average variable cost AVC and average fixed cost AFC. Marginal cost MC crosses the average vari-able cost and average total cost curves at their minimum points.
4The curves do not exactly match the numbers in Table 7.1. Because marginal cost represents the 
change in cost associated with a change in output, we have plotted the MC curve for the first unit of output by setting output equal to 1
2, for the second unit by setting output equal to 11
2, and so on.240  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
(with respect to marginal and average product). At an output of 5 in Table 7.1, for 
example, the marginal cost of $18 is below the average variable cost of $26; thus the average is lowered in response to increases in output. But when  marginal cost is $29, which is greater than average variable cost ($25.5), the average increases as output increases. Finally, when marginal cost ($25) and average variable cost ($25) are nearly the same, average variable cost increases only slightly.
The ATC curve shows the average total cost of production. Because average 
total cost is the sum of average variable cost and average fixed cost and the AFC curve declines everywhere, the vertical distance between the ATC and AVC curves decreases as output increases. The AVC cost curve reaches its minimum point at a lower output than the ATC curve. This follows because MC =AVC 
at its minimum point and MC =ATC at its minimum point. Because ATC is 
always greater than AVC and the marginal cost curve MC is rising, the mini-mum point of the ATC curve must lie above and to the right of the minimum point of the AVC curve.
Another way to see the relationship between the total cost curves and the 
average and marginal cost curves is to consider the line drawn from origin to point A in Figure 7.1 (a). In that figure, the slope of the line measures average 
variable cost (a total cost of $175 divided by an output of 7, or a cost per unit of $25). Because the slope of the VC curve is the marginal cost (it measures the change in variable cost as output increases by 1 unit), the tangent to the VC curve at A is the marginal cost of production when output is 7. At A, this mar-
ginal cost of $25 is equal to the average variable cost of $25 because average variable cost is minimized at this output.
TOTAL COST AS A FLOW  Note that the firm’s output is measured as a flow: The 
firm produces a certain number of units per year.  Thus its total cost is a flow—for 
example, some number of dollars per year. (Average and marginal costs, however, are measured in dollars per unit. ) For simplicity, we will often drop the time refer-
ence, and refer to total cost in dollars and output in units. But you should remem-ber that a firm’s production of output and expenditure of cost occur over some time period. In addition, we will often use cost (C) to refer to total cost. Likewise, 
unless noted otherwise, we will use average cost  (AC) to refer to average total cost.
Marginal and average cost are very important concepts. As we will see in 
Chapter 8, they enter critically into the firm’s choice of output level. Knowledge of short-run costs is particularly important for firms that operate in an environ-ment in which demand conditions fluctuate considerably. If the firm is currently producing at a level of output at which marginal cost is sharply increasing, and if demand may increase in the future, management might want to expand  production capacity to avoid higher costs.
EXAMPLE 7.3  THE SHORT-RUN COST OF ALUMINUM 
SMELTING
Aluminum is a lightweight, versatile metal used in a wide variety of appli-
cations, including airplanes, automobiles, packaging, and building materials. The production of aluminum begins with the mining of bauxite in such coun-
tries as Australia, Brazil, Guinea, Jamaica, and Suriname. Bauxite is an ore that contains a relatively high concentration of alumina (aluminum oxide), which is separated from the bauxite through a chemical refining process. The CHAPTER 7   •  The Cost of Production  241
alumina is then converted to aluminum through a smelting process in which 
an electric current is used to separate the oxygen atoms from the aluminum oxide molecules. It is this smelting process—which is the most costly step in producing aluminum—that we focus on here.
All of the major aluminum producers, including UC RUSAL, Alcoa, 
Alcan, Chalco, and Hydro Aluminum, operate smelting plants. A typical smelting plant will have two production lines, each of which produces approximately 300 to 400 tons of aluminum per day. We will examine the short-run cost of production. Thus we consider the cost of operating an existing plant because there is insufficient time in the short run to build additional plants. (It takes about four years to plan, build, and fully equip an aluminum smelting plant.)
Although the cost of a smelting plant is substantial (over $1 billion), we will 
assume that the plant cannot be sold; the expenditure is therefore sunk and can be ignored. Furthermore, because fixed costs, which are largely for admin-istrative expenses, are relatively small, we will ignore them also. Thus we can focus entirely on short-run variable costs. Table 7.2 shows the average (per-ton) production costs for a typical aluminum smelter.
5 The cost numbers apply to a 
plant that runs two shifts per day to produce 600 tons of aluminum per day. If prices were sufficiently high, the firm could choose to operate the plant on a three-shifts-per-day basis by asking workers to work overtime. However, wage and maintenance costs would likely increase about 50 percent for this third shift because of the need to pay higher overtime wages. We have divided the cost components in Table 7.2 into two groups. The first group includes those costs that would remain the same at any output level; the second includes costs that would increase if output exceeded 600 tons per day.
5This example is based on Kenneth S. Corts, “The Aluminum Industry in 1994,” Harvard Business 
School Case N9-799-129, April 1999.TABLE 7.2  PRODUCTION COSTS FOR ALUMINUM

Total per-ton production costs $1140 $1300242  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
Note that the largest cost components for an aluminum smelter are electric-
ity and the cost of alumina; together, they represent about 60 percent of total production costs. Because electricity, alumina, and other raw materials are used in direct proportion to the amount of aluminum produced, they represent per-ton production costs that are constant with respect to the level of output. The costs of labor, maintenance, and freight are also proportional to the level of output, but only when the plant operates two shifts per day. To increase output above 600 tons per day, a third shift would be necessary and would result in a 50-percent increase in the per-ton costs of labor, maintenance, and freight.
The short-run marginal cost and average variable cost curves for the smelt-
ing plant are shown in Figure 7.2. For an output q up to 600 tons per day, 
total variable cost is $1140 q, so marginal cost and average variable cost are 
constant at $1140 per ton. If we increase production beyond 600 tons per day by means of a third shift, the marginal cost of labor, maintenance, and freight increases from $320 per ton to $480 per ton, which causes marginal cost as a whole to increase from $1140 per ton to $1300 per ton.
What happens to average variable cost when output is greater than 600 
tons per day? When q> 600, total variable cost is given by:
TVC=(1140)(600) +1300( q-600)=1300 q-96,000
Therefore average variable cost is
AVC=1300 - 96,000
q
As Figure 7.2 shows, when output reaches 900 tons per day, an absolute 
capacity constraint is reached, at which point the marginal and average costs of production become infinite.

THE SHORT-RUN VARIABLE COSTS OF 
ALUMINUM SMELTING
The short-run average variable cost of smelt-
ing is constant for output levels using up to two labor shifts. When a third shift is added, marginal cost and average variable cost in-crease until maximum capacity is reached.CHAPTER 7   •  The Cost of Production  243
7.3  Cost in the Long Run
In the long run, a firm has much more flexibility. It can expand its capacity by 
expanding existing factories or building new ones; it can expand or contract its labor force, and in some cases, it can change the design of its products or intro-duce new products. In this section, we show how a firm can choose its combi-nation of inputs to minimize its cost of producing a given output. We will also examine the relationship between long-run cost and the level of output. We begin by taking a careful look at the cost of using capital equipment. We then show how this cost, along with the cost of labor, enters into the production decision.
The User Cost of Capital
Firms often rent or lease equipment, buildings, and other capital used in the production process. On other occasions, the capital is purchased. In our analy-sis, however, it will be useful to treat capital as though it were rented even if it was purchased. An illustration will help to explain how and why we do this. Let’s suppose that Delta Airlines is thinking about purchasing a new Boeing 777 airplane for $150 million. Even though Delta would pay a large sum for the air-plane now, for economic purposes the purchase price can be allocated or amor-
tized  across the life of the airplane. This will allow Delta to compare its revenues 
and costs on an annual flow basis.  We will assume that the life of the airplane is 30 
years; the amortized cost is therefore $5 million per year. The $5 million can be viewed as the annual economic depreciation  for the airplane.
So far, we have ignored the fact that had the firm not purchased the airplane, 
it could have earned interest on its $150 million. This forgone interest is an opportunity cost  that must be accounted for. Therefore, the user cost of capital —
the annual cost of owning and using the airplane instead of selling it or never buying it in the first place—is given by the sum of the economic depreciation and 
the interest (i.e., the financial return) that could have been earned had the money been invested elsewhere.
6 Formally,
User Cost of Capital = Economic Depreciation +(Interest Rate)
(Value of Capital)
In our example, economic depreciation on the airplane is $5 million per year. 
Suppose Delta could have earned a return of 10 percent had it invested its money elsewhere. In that case, the user cost of capital is $5 million +(.10)
($150 million − depreciation). As the plane depreciates over time, its value 
declines, as does the opportunity cost of the financial capital that is invested in it. For example, at the time of purchase, looking forward for the first year, the user cost of capital is $5 million +(.10)($150 million) =$20 million. In the tenth 
year of ownership, the airplane, which will have depreciated by $50 million, will be worth $100 million. At that point, the user cost of capital will be  $5 million +(.10)($100 million) =$15 million per year.
We can also express the user cost of capital as a rate per dollar of capital:
r=Depreciation rate +Interest rate• user cost of capital  Annual 
cost of owning and using a capital asset, equal to economic depreciation plus forgone interest.
6More precisely, the financial return should reflect an investment with similar risk. The interest rate, 
therefore, should include a risk premium. We discuss this point in Chapter 15. Note also that the user cost of capital is not adjusted for taxes; when taxes are taken into account, revenues and costs should be measured on an after-tax basis.244  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
For our airplane example, the depreciation rate is 1 >30= 3.33 percent per year. 
If Delta could have earned a rate of return of 10 percent per year, its user cost of capital would be r=3.33 +10=13.33  percent per year.
As we’ve already pointed out, in the long run the firm can change all of its 
inputs. We will now show how the firm chooses the combination of inputs that minimizes the cost of producing a certain output, given information about wages and the user cost of capital. We will then examine the relationship between  long-run cost and the level of output.
The Cost-Minimizing Input Choice
We now turn to a fundamental problem that all firms face: how to select inputs to 
produce a given output at minimum cost.  For simplicity, we will work with two vari-
able inputs: labor (measured in hours of work per year) and capital (measured in hours of use of machinery per year).
The amount of labor and capital that the firm uses will depend, of course, on 
the prices of these inputs. We will assume that because there are competitive markets for both inputs, their prices are unaffected by what the firm does. (In Chapter 14 we will examine labor markets that are not competitive.) In this case, the price of labor is simply the wage rate , w. But what about the price of capital?
THE PRICE OF CAPITAL  In the long run, the firm can adjust the amount of cap-
ital it uses. Even if the capital includes specialized machinery that has no alterna-tive use, expenditures on this machinery are not yet sunk and must be taken into account; the firm is deciding prospectively  how much capital to obtain. Unlike 
labor expenditures, however, large initial expenditures on capital are necessary. In order to compare the firm’s expenditure on capital with its ongoing cost of labor, we want to express this capital expenditure as a flow—e.g., in dollars per 
year. To do this, we must amortize the expenditure by spreading it over the life-time of the capital, and we must also account for the forgone interest that the firm could have earned by investing the money elsewhere. As we have just seen, this is exactly what we do when we calculate the user cost of capital.  As above, the 
price of capital is its user cost , given by r /H11005 Depreciation rate /H11001 Interest rate.
THE RENTAL RATE OF CAPITAL  As we noted, capital is often rented rather than 
purchased. An example is office space in a large office building. In this case, the price of capital is its rental rate —i.e., the cost per year for renting a unit of capital.
Does this mean that we must distinguish between capital that is rented and 
capital that is purchased when we determine the price of capital? No. If the capi-tal market is competitive (as we have assumed it is), the rental rate should be equal 
to the user cost , r. Why? Because in a competitive market, firms that own capital 
(e.g., the owner of the large office building) expect to earn a competitive return when they rent it—namely, the rate of return that they could have earned by investing their money elsewhere, plus an amount to compensate for the depre-ciation of the capital. This competitive return is the user cost of capital.
Many textbooks simply assume that all capital is rented at a rental rate r. As 
we have just seen, this assumption is reasonable. However, you should now understand why it is reasonable: Capital that is purchased can be treated as though it 
were rented at a rental rate equal to the user cost of capital.
For the remainder of this chapter, we will therefore assume that a firm rents 
all of its capital at a rental rate, or “price,” r, just as it hires labor at a wage rate, 
or “price,” w. We will also assume that firms treat any sunk cost of capital as a 
fixed cost that is spread out over time. We need not, therefore, concern ourselves • rental rate  Cost per year of 
renting one unit of capital.CHAPTER 7   •  The Cost of Production  245
with sunk costs. Rather, we can now focus on how a firm takes these prices into 
account when determining how much capital and labor to utilize.7
The Isocost Line
We begin by looking at the cost of hiring factor inputs, which can be represented by a firm’s isocost lines. An isocost line  shows all possible combinations of labor 
and capital that can be purchased for a given total cost. To see what an isocost line looks like, recall that the total cost C of producing any particular output is 
given by the sum of the firm’s labor cost wL and its capital cost rK:
 C=wL+rK (7.2)
For each different level of total cost, equation (7.2) describes a different isocost 
line. In Figure 7.3, for example, the isocost line C
0 describes all possible combi-
nations of labor and capital that cost a total of C0 to hire.
If we rewrite the total cost equation as an equation for a straight line, we get
K=C/r-(w/r)L
It follows that the isocost line has a slope of /H9004K//H9004L /H11005 −(w/r), which is the ratio of 
the wage rate to the rental cost of capital. Note that this slope is similar to the slope of the budget line that the consumer faces (because it is determined solely by the prices of the goods in question, whether inputs or outputs). It tells us that if the firm gave up a unit of labor (and recovered w dollars in cost) to buy w/r units of capital 
at a cost of r dollars per unit, its total cost of production would remain the same. For 
example, if the wage rate were $10 and the rental cost of capital $5, the firm could replace one unit of labor with two units of capital with no change in total cost.
Choosing Inputs
Suppose we wish to produce at an output level q1. How can we do so at minimum 
cost? Look at the firm’s production isoquant, labeled q1, in Figure 7.3. The problem 
is to choose the point on this isoquant that minimizes total cost.
Figure 7.3 illustrates the solution to this problem. Suppose the firm were to 
spend C0 on inputs. Unfortunately, no combination of inputs can be purchased 
for expenditure C0 that will allow the firm to achieve output q1. However, output 
q1 can be achieved with the expenditure of C2, either by using K2 units of  capital 
and L2 units of labor, or by using K3 units of capital and L3 units of labor. But C2 
is not the minimum cost. The same output q1 can be produced more cheaply, at a 
cost of C1, by using K1 units of capital and L1 units of labor. In fact, isocost line C1 is 
the lowest isocost line that allows output q1 to be produced. The point of tangency 
of the isoquant q1 and the isocost line C1 at point A gives us the cost-minimizing 
choice of inputs, L1 and K1, which can be read directly from the diagram. At this 
point, the slopes of the isoquant and the isocost line are just equal.
When the expenditure on all inputs increases, the slope of the isocost line does 
not change because the prices of the inputs have not changed. The intercept, how-ever, increases. Suppose that the price of one of the inputs, such as labor, were  
to increase. In that case, the slope of the isocost line −( w/r) would increase in • isocost line  Graph showing 
all possible combinations of labor and capital that can be purchased for a given total cost.
7It is possible, of course, that input prices might increase with demand because of overtime or a rela-
tive shortage of capital equipment. We discuss the possibility of a relationship between the price of factor inputs and the quantities demanded by a firm in Chapter 14.246  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
magnitude and the isocost line would become steeper. Figure 7.4 shows this. 
Initially, the isocost line is C1, and the firm minimizes its costs of producing out-
put q1 at A by using L1 units of labor and K1 units of capital. When the price of 
labor increases, the isocost line becomes steeper. The isocost line C2 reflects the 
higher price of labor. Facing this higher price of labor, the firm  minimizes its cost of producing output q

produced at minimum cost with labor input L

of capital. The firm has responded to the higher price of labor by substituting 
capital for labor in the production process.
How does the isocost line relate to the firm’s production process? Recall that in 
our analysis of production technology, we showed that the marginal rate of tech-nical substitution of labor for capital (MRTS) is the negative of the slope of the isoquant and is equal to the ratio of the marginal products of labor and capital:
MRTS =-/H9004K//H9004L=MP
L/MP K (7.3)
Above, we noted that the isocost line has a slope of /H9004K//H9004L=-w/r It  follows 
that when a firm minimizes the cost of producing a particular output, the  following condition holds:
MP
L/MP K=w/r
We can rewrite this condition slightly as follows:
MP L/w=MP K/r (7.4)
MPL/w is the additional output that results from spending an additional dol-
lar for labor. Suppose that the wage rate is $10 and that adding a worker to the production process will increase output by 20 units. The additional output per dollar spent on an additional worker will be 20/10 =2 units of output per dol-
lar. Similarly, MP
K/r is the additional output that results from spending an addi-
tional dollar for capital. Therefore, equation (7.4) tells us that a cost-minimizing firm should choose its quantities of inputs so that the last dollar’s worth of any input added to the production process yields the same amount of extra output.
Why must this condition hold for cost minimization? Suppose that in addi-
tion to the $10 wage rate, the rental rate on capital is $2. Suppose also that add-ing a unit of capital will increase output by 20 units. In that case, the additional output per dollar of capital input would be 20/$2 =10 units of output per dol-
lar. Because a dollar spent for capital is five times more productive than a dollar spent for labor, the firm will want to use more capital and less labor. If the firm reduces labor and increases capital, its marginal product of labor will rise and its marginal product of capital will fall. Eventually, the point will be reached at which the production of an additional unit of output costs the same regardless of which additional input is used. At that point, the firm is minimizing its cost.In §6.3, we explain that 
the MRTS is the amount by which the input of capital can be reduced when one extra unit of labor is used, so that output remains constant.
EXAMPLE 7.4  THE EFFECT OF EFFLUENT FEES ON INPUT CHOICES
Steel plants are often built on 
or near rivers. Rivers offer read-ily available, inexpensive trans-portation for both the iron ore that goes into the production process and the finished steel itself. Unfortunately, rivers also provide cheap disposal methods for by-products of the production process, called effluent.  For example, a steel plant processes iron ore for use in blast 
furnaces by  grinding taconite 
deposits into a fine consistency. During this process, the ore is extracted by a magnetic field as a flow of water and fine ore passes through the plant. One by-prod-uct of this  process—fine taconite 
particles—can be dumped in the 
river at relatively little cost to the firm. Alternative 
248  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
removal methods or private treatment plants are 
relatively expensive.
Because taconite particles are a nondegrad-
able waste that can harm vegetation and fish, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has imposed an effluent fee—a per-unit fee that the steel firm must pay for the effluent that goes into the river. How should the manager of a steel plant deal with the imposition of this fee to minimize production costs?
Suppose that without regulation the plant is 
producing 2000 tons of steel per month, using 2000 machine-hours of capital and 10,000 gallons of water (which contains taconite particles when returned to the river). The manager estimates that a machine-hour costs $40 and that dumping each gallon of wastewater in the river costs $10. The total cost of production is therefore $180,000: $80,000 for capital and $100,000 for wastewater. How should the manager respond to an EPA-imposed effluent fee of $10 per gallon of wastewater dumped? The 
manager knows that there is some flexibility in the production process. If the firm puts into place more expensive effluent treatment equipment, it can achieve the same output with less wastewater.
Figure 7.5 shows the cost-minimizing response. 
The vertical axis measures the firm’s input of capi-tal in machine-hours per month—the horizontal axis measures the quantity of wastewater in gallons per month. First, consider the level at which the firm produces when there is no effluent fee. Point A represents the input of capital and the level 
of wastewater that allows the firm to produce its quota of steel at minimum cost. Because the firm is minimizing cost, A lies on the isocost line FC, 
which is tangent to the isoquant. The slope of the isocost line is equal to 
-$10/$40 =-0.25 because 
a unit of capital costs four times more than a unit of wastewater.Output of 2000

THE COST-MINIMIZING RESPONSE TO AN EFFLUENT FEE
When the firm is not charged for dumping its wastewater in a river, it chooses to produce 
a given output using 10,000 gallons of wastewater and 2000 machine-hours of capital at A. 
However, an effluent fee raises the cost of wastewater, shifts the isocost curve from FC to DE, 
and causes the firm to produce at B—a process that results in much less effluent.CHAPTER 7   •  The Cost of Production  249
Cost Minimization with Varying Output Levels
In the previous section we saw how a cost-minimizing firm selects a combina-
tion of inputs to produce a given level of output. Now we extend this analysis to see how the firm’s costs depend on its output level. To do this, we determine the firm’s cost-minimizing input quantities for each output level and then calculate the resulting cost.
The cost-minimization exercise yields the result illustrated by Figure 7.6. We 
have assumed that the firm can hire labor L at w=$10/hour and rent a unit of 
capital K for r=$20/hour. Given these input costs, we have drawn three of the 
firm’s isocost lines. Each isocost line is given by the following equation:
C=($10/hour)( L)+($20/hour)( K)
In Figure 7.6 (a), the lowest (unlabeled) line represents a cost of $1000, the middle 
line $2000, and the highest line $3000.
You can see that each of the points A, B, and C in Figure 7.6 (a) is a point of 
tangency between an isocost curve and an isoquant. Point B, for example, shows 
us that the lowest-cost way to produce 200 units of output is to use 100 units of labor and 50 units of capital; this combination lies on the $2000 isocost line. Similarly, the lowest-cost way to produce 100 units of output (the lowest unla-beled isoquant) is $1000 (at point A, L=50, K=25); the least-cost means of 
getting 300 units of output is $3000 (at point C, L=150, K=75).
The curve passing through the points of tangency between the firm’s isocost 
lines and its isoquants is its expansion path.  The expansion path  describes the 
combinations of labor and capital that the firm will choose to minimize costs at each output level. As long as the use of both labor and capital increases with output, the curve will be upward sloping. In this particular case we can easily calculate the slope of the line. As output increases from 100 to 200 units, capital increases from 25 to 50 units, while labor increases from 50 to 100 units. For each level of output, the firm uses half as much capital as labor. Therefore, the expan-sion path is a straight line with a slope equal to
/H9004K//H9004L=(50-25)/(100 -50)= 
1
2• expansion path  Curve 
passing through points of tangency between a firm’s isocost lines and its isoquants.When the effluent fee is imposed, the cost of waste-
water increases from $10 per gallon to $20: For every gallon of wastewater (which costs $10), the firm has to pay the government an additional $10. The effluent fee therefore increases the cost of wastewater relative to capital. To produce the same output at the lowest possible cost, the manager must choose the isocost line with a slope of −$20/$40 = −0.5 that is tangent to the isoquant. In Figure 7.5, DE is the appropriate iso-
cost line, and B gives the appropriate combination of 
capital and wastewater. The move from A to B shows 
that with an effluent fee the use of an alternative pro-duction technology that emphasizes the greater use of capital (3500 machine-hours) and less production of wastewater (5000 gallons) is cheaper than the original process, which did not emphasize recycling. 
Note that the total cost of  production has increased 
to $240,000: $140,000 for capital, $50,000 for waste-water, and $50,000 for the effluent fee.
We can learn two lessons from this decision. 
First, the more easily factors can be substituted in the production process—that is, the more easily the firm can deal with its taconite particles without using the river for waste treatment—the more effec-tive the fee will be in reducing effluent. Second, the greater the degree of substitution, the less the firm will have to pay. In our example, the fee would have been $100,000 had the firm not changed its inputs. By moving production from A to B, however, the 
steel company pays only a $50,000 fee.250  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
The Expansion Path and Long-Run Costs
The firm’s expansion path contains the same information as its long-run total 
cost curve, C(q). This can be seen in Figure 7.6 (b). To move from the expansion 
path to the cost curve, we follow three steps:
 1. Choose an output level represented by an isoquant in Figure 7.6 (a). Then 
find the point of tangency of that isoquant with an isocost line.150

A FIRM’S EXPANSION PATH AND LONG-RUN TOTAL COST CURVE
In (a), the expansion path (from the origin through points A, B, and C) illustrates the lowest-
cost combinations of labor and capital that can be used to produce each level of output in the long run—i.e., when both inputs to production can be varied. In (b), the corresponding 
long-run total cost curve (from the origin through points D, E, and F) measures the least 
cost of producing each level of output.CHAPTER 7   •  The Cost of Production  251
EXAMPLE 7.5  REDUCING THE USE OF ENERGY
Policy makers around the world have been con-
cerned with finding ways to reduce the use of energy. In part, this reflects environmental con-cerns—most energy consumption uses fossil fuels and thus contributes to the emission of greenhouse gases and global warming. But energy, whether in the form of oil, natural gas, coal or nuclear, is also expensive, so if companies can find ways to reduce their energy use, they can lower their costs.
There are essentially two ways that companies 
can reduce the amount of energy they use. The first is to substitute other factors of production for energy. For example, some machines might be more costly but also use less energy, so if energy prices rise, firms could respond by buying and using those energy-efficient machines, effectively substituting capital for energy. This is exactly what has happened as energy prices rose in recent years: firms bought and installed expensive but more energy-efficient heating and cooling systems, industrial processing equipment, trucks, cars, and other vehicles.
The second way to reduce energy use is through 
technological change. As time passes, research and development lead to innovations that make it  possible to produce the same output using fewer 
inputs—less labor, less capital, and less energy. Thus even if the relative prices of energy and capital stay the same, firms will use less energy (and less capital) to produce the same output. Advances in robotics during the past two decades are an example of this; cars and trucks are now produced with less capital and energy (as well as less labor).
These two ways of reducing energy use are 
illustrated in Figures 7.7(a) and (b), which show how capital and energy are combined to produce  output.
8 The isoquants in each figure represent the 
various combinations of capital and energy that can be used to generate the same level of output. The figures illustrate how reductions in energy use can be achieved in two ways. First, firms can substi-tute more capital for energy, perhaps in response to a government subsidy for investment in energy-saving equipment and/or an increase in the cost of electricity. This is shown as a movement along iso-quant q
1 from point A to point B in Figure 7.7(a), 
with capital increasing from K1 to K2 and energy 
decreasing from E2 to E1 in response to a shift in the 
isocost curve from C0 to C1. Second,  technological  2. From the chosen isocost line, determine the minimum cost of producing 
the output level that has been selected.
 3. Graph the output-cost combination in Figure 7.6 (b).
Suppose we begin with an output of 100 units. The point of tangency of the 
100-unit isoquant with an isocost line is given by point A in Figure 7.6 (a). Because 
A lies on the $1000 isocost line, we know that the minimum cost of producing an 
output of 100 units in the long run is $1000. We graph this combination of 100 units of output and $1000 cost as point D in Figure 7.6 (b). Point D thus represents the 
$1000 cost of producing 100 units of output. Similarly, point E represents the $2000 
cost of producing 200 units which corresponds to point B on the expansion path. 
Finally, point F represents the $3000 cost of 300 units corresponding to point C. 
Repeating these steps for every level of output gives the long-run total cost curve  in 
Figure 7.6 (b)—i.e., the minimum long-run cost of producing each level of output.
In this particular example, the long-run total cost curve is a straight line. 
Why? Because there are constant returns to scale in production: As inputs increase  proportionately, so do outputs. As we will see in the next section, the shape of the expansion path provides information about how costs change with the scale of the firm’s operation.

change can shift the isoquant q1 that represents a 
particular output level inward, as in Figure 7.7(b). Be careful when you read this graph. Both isoquants generate the same level of output, but the techno-logical change has made it possible to achieve the same output with less capital (a move from K
2 to K1) and with less energy (a move from E2 to E1). The 
result is that isoquant q1 has moved inward from 
one that is tangent to an isocost curve at point C to 
one that is tangent at point D because we can now 
achieve the same output ( q1) with less capital and 
less energy.
7.4   Long-Run versus Short-Run 
Cost Curves
We saw earlier (see Figure 7.1— page 239) that short-run average cost curves are 
U-shaped. We will see that long-run average cost curves can also be U-shaped, 
but different economic factors explain the shapes of these curves. In this section, we discuss long-run average and marginal cost curves and highlight the differ-ences between these curves and their short-run counterparts.
The Inflexibility of Short-Run Production
Recall that we defined the long run as occurring when all inputs to the firm are variable. In the long run, the firm’s planning horizon is long enough to allow for a change in plant size. This added flexibility allows the firm to produce at a lower average cost than in the short run. To see why, we might compare the situation in which capital and labor are both flexible to the case in which capi-tal is fixed in the short run.
Figure 7.8 shows the firm’s production isoquants. The firm’s long-run expan-
sion path  is the straight line from the origin that corresponds to the expansion

THE INFLEXIBILITY OF SHORT-RUN 
PRODUCTION
When a firm operates in the short run, its 
cost of production may not be minimized because of inflexibility in the use of capi-tal inputs. Output is initially at level q
1. In 
the short run, output q2 can be produced 
only by increasing labor from L1 to L3 be-
cause capital is fixed at K1. In the long run, 
the same output can be produced more cheaply by increasing labor from L
1 to L2 
and capital from K1 to K2.254  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
path in Figure 7.6. Now, suppose capital is fixed at a level K1 in the short run. To 
produce output q1, the firm would minimize costs by choosing labor equal to L1, 
corresponding to the point of tangency with the isocost line AB. The inflexibility 
appears when the firm decides to increase its output to q2 without increasing its 
use of capital. If capital were not fixed, it would produce this output with capital K
2 and labor L2. Its cost of production would be reflected by isocost line CD.
However, the fact that capital is fixed forces the firm to increase its output by 
using capital K1 and labor L3 at point P. Point P lies on the isocost line EF, which 
represents a higher cost than isocost line CD. Why is the cost of production higher 
when capital is fixed? Because the firm is unable to substitute relatively inexpen-sive capital for more costly labor when it expands production. This inflexibility is reflected in the short-run expansion path , which begins as a line from the origin 
and then becomes a horizontal line when the capital input reaches K
1.
Long-Run Average Cost
In the long run, the ability to change the amount of capital allows the firm to 
reduce costs. To see how costs vary as the firm moves along its expansion path in the long run, we can look at the long-run average and marginal cost curves.
9 The 
most important determinant of the shape of the long-run average and marginal cost curves is the relationship between the scale of the firm’s operation and the inputs that are required to minimize its costs. Suppose, for example, that the firm’s production process exhibits constant returns to scale at all input levels. In this case, a doubling of inputs leads to a doubling of output. Because input prices remain unchanged as output increases, the average cost of production must be the same for all levels of output.
Suppose instead that the firm’s production process is subject to increasing 
returns to scale: A doubling of inputs leads to more than a doubling of output. In that case, the average cost of production falls with output because a doubling of costs is associated with a more than twofold increase in output. By the same logic, when there are decreasing returns to scale, the average cost of production must be increasing with output.
We saw that the long-run total cost curve associated with the expansion path in 
Figure 7.6 (a) was a straight line from the origin. In this constant-returns-to-scale case, the long-run average cost of production is constant: It is unchanged as out-put increases. For an output of 100, long-run average cost is $1000/100 = $10 
per unit. For an output of 200, long-run average cost is $2000/200 =$10 per 
unit; for an output of 300, average cost is also $10 per unit. Because a constant average cost means a constant marginal cost, the long-run average and marginal cost curves are given by a horizontal line at a $10/unit cost.
Recall that in the last chapter we examined a firm’s production technology 
that exhibits first increasing returns to scale, then constant returns to scale, and eventually decreasing returns to scale. Figure 7.9 shows a typical long-run aver-
age cost curve (LAC)  consistent with this description of the production process. 
Like the short-run average cost curve (SAC),  the long-run average cost curve is 
U-shaped, but the source of the U-shape is increasing and decreasing returns to 
scale, rather than diminishing returns to a factor of production.
The long-run marginal cost curve (LMC)  can be determined from the long-
run average cost curve; it measures the change in long-run total costs as  output

cost of production to output when all inputs, including capital, are variable.

9In the short run, the shapes of the average and marginal cost curves were determined primarily by 
diminishing returns. As we showed in Chapter 6, diminishing returns to each factor is consistent with constant (or even increasing) returns to scale.CHAPTER 7   •  The Cost of Production  255

when LAC is falling and above it when LAC is rising.10 The two curves intersect 
at A, where the long-run average cost curve achieves its minimum. In the special 
case in which LAC is constant, LAC and LMC are equal.
Economies and Diseconomies of Scale
As output increases, the firm’s average cost of producing that output is likely to decline, at least to a point. This can happen for the following reasons:
 1. If the firm operates on a larger scale, workers can specialize in the activities 
at which they are most productive.
 2. Scale can provide flexibility. By varying the combination of inputs utilized 
to produce the firm’s output, managers can organize the production pro-cess more effectively.
 3. The firm may be able to acquire some production inputs at lower cost 
because it is buying them in large quantities and can therefore negotiate better prices. The mix of inputs might change with the scale of the firm’s operation if managers take advantage of lower-cost inputs.
At some point, however, it is likely that the average cost of production 
will begin to increase with output. There are three reasons for this shift:
 1. At least in the short run, factory space and machinery may make it more 
difficult for workers to do their jobs effectively.
 2. Managing a larger firm may become more complex and inefficient as the 
number of tasks increases.
 3. The advantages of buying in bulk may have disappeared once certain 
quantities are reached. At some point, available supplies of key inputs may be limited, pushing their costs up.
To analyze the relationship between the scale of the firm’s operation and the 
firm’s costs, we need to recognize that when input proportions do change, the firm’s expansion path is no longer a straight line, and the concept of returns to 
10Recall that AC  /H11005 TC/ q. It follows that /H9004AC/ /H9004q /H11005 [q(/H9004TC/ /H9004q) − TC]/ q2 /H11005 (MC − AC)/ q. Clearly, 
when AC is increasing, /H9004AC/ /H9004q is positive and MC > AC. Correspondingly, when AC is decreasing, 
/H9004AC/ /H9004q is negative and MC < AC.256  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
scale no longer applies. Rather, we say that a firm enjoys economies of scale  
when it can double its output for less than twice the cost. Correspondingly, there are diseconomies of scale  when a doubling of output requires more than 
twice the cost. The term economies of scale  includes increasing returns to scale 
as a special case, but it is more general because it reflects input proportions that change as the firm changes its level of production. In this more general setting, a U-shaped long-run average cost curve characterizes the firm facing 
economies of scale for relatively low output levels and diseconomies of scale for higher levels.
To see the difference between returns to scale (in which inputs are used in 
constant proportions as output is increased) and economies of scale (in which input proportions are variable), consider a dairy farm. Milk production is a function of land, equipment, cows, and feed. A dairy farm with 50 cows will use an input mix weighted toward labor and not equipment (i.e., cows are milked by hand). If all inputs were doubled, a farm with 100 cows could double its milk production. The same will be true for the farm with 200 cows, and so forth. In this case, there are constant returns to scale.
Large dairy farms, however, have the option of using milking machines. If a 
large farm continues milking cows by hand, regardless of the size of the farm, constant returns would continue to apply. However, when the farm moves from 50 to 100 cows, it switches its technology toward the use of machines, and, in the process, is able to reduce its average cost of milk production from 20 cents per gallon to 15 cents per gallon. In this case, there are economies of scale.
This example illustrates the fact that a firm’s production process can exhibit 
constant returns to scale, but still have economies of scale as well. Of course, firms can enjoy both increasing returns to scale and economies of scale. It is helpful to compare the two:
Increasing Returns to Scale :  Output more than doubles when the quantities 
of all inputs are doubled.
Economies of Scale :  A doubling of output requires less than a 
doubling of cost.
Economies of scale are often measured in terms of a cost-output elasticity, E
C. 
EC is the percentage change in the cost of production resulting from a 1-percent 
increase in output:
 EC=(/H9004C/C)/(/H9004q/q) (7.5)
To see how EC relates to our traditional measures of cost, rewrite equation 
(7.5) as follows:
 EC=(/H9004C//H9004q)/(C/q)=MC/AC  (7.6)
Clearly, EC is equal to 1 when marginal and average costs are equal. In that case, 
costs increase proportionately with output, and there are neither economies nor diseconomies of scale (constant returns to scale would apply if input propor-tions were fixed). When there are economies of scale (when costs increase less than proportionately with output), marginal cost is less than average cost (both are declining) and E
C is less than 1. Finally, when there are diseconomies of scale, 
marginal cost is greater than average cost and EC is greater than 1.• economies of scale   
Situation in which output can be doubled for less than a doubling of cost.
• diseconomies of scale   
Situation in which a doubling of output requires more than a doubling of cost.
In §6.4, we explain that increasing returns to scale occurs when output more than doubles as inputs are doubled proportionately.CHAPTER 7   •  The Cost of Production  257
The Relationship between Short-Run  
and Long-Run Cost
Figure 7.10 shows the relationship between short-run and long-run cost. Assume 
that a firm is uncertain about the future demand for its product and is consider-ing three alternative plant sizes. The short-run average cost curves for the three plants are given by SAC
1, SAC2, and SAC3. The decision is important because, 
once built, the firm may not be able to change the plant size for some time.
Figure 7.10 illustrates the case in which there are three possible plant sizes. If 
the firm expects to produce q0 units of output, then it should build the smallest 
plant. Its average cost of production would be $8. (If it then decided to produce an output of q
1, its short run average cost would still be $8.) However, if it expects 
to produce q2, the middle-size plant is best. Similarly, with an output of q3, the 
largest of the three plants would be the most efficient choice.
What is the firm’s long-run average cost curve? In the long run, the firm can 
change the size of its plant. In doing so, it will always choose the plant that mini-mizes the average cost of production.
The long-run average cost curve is given by the crosshatched portions of the 
short-run average cost curves because these show the minimum cost of produc-tion for any output level. The long-run average cost curve is the envelope  of the 
short-run average cost curves—it envelops or surrounds the short-run curves.
Now suppose that there are many choices of plant size, each having a differ-
ent short-run average cost curve. Again, the long-run average cost curve is the envelope of the short-run curves. In Figure 7.10 it is the curve LAC. Whatever the firm wants to produce, it can choose the plant size (and the mix of capital and labor) that allows it to produce that output at the minimum average cost. The long-run average cost curve exhibits economies of scale initially but exhib-its diseconomies at higher output levels.
To clarify the relationship between short-run and long-run cost curves, consider 
a firm that wants to produce output q
1. If it builds a small plant, the short-run aver-
age cost curve SAC1 is relevant. The average cost of production (at B on SAC1) is 
$8. A small plant is a better choice than a medium-sized plant with an average cost of production of $10 ( A on curve SAC
2). Point B would therefore become one point 
on the long-run cost function when only three plant sizes are possible. If plants of

other sizes could be built, and if at least one size allowed the firm to produce q1 at 
less than $8 per unit, then B would no longer be on the long-run cost curve.
In Figure 7.10, the envelope that would arise if plants of any size could be 
built is U-shaped. Note, once again, that the LAC curve never lies above any 
of the short-run average cost curves. Also note that because there are econo-mies and diseconomies of scale in the long run, the points of minimum average cost of the smallest and largest plants do not lie on the long-run average cost 
curve. For example, a small plant operating at minimum average cost is not effi-cient because a larger plant can take advantage of increasing returns to scale to  produce at a lower average cost.
Finally, note that the long-run marginal cost curve LMC is not the envelope of 
the short-run marginal cost curves. Short-run marginal costs apply to a particu-lar plant; long-run marginal costs apply to all possible plant sizes. Each point on the long-run marginal cost curve is the short-run marginal cost associated with the most cost-efficient plant. Consistent with this relationship, SMC

LMC in Figure 7.10 at the output level q0 at which SAC1 is  tangent to LAC.
7.5   Production with Two Outputs—
Economies of Scope
Many firms produce more than one product. Sometimes a firm’s products are 
closely linked to one another: A chicken farm, for instance, produces poultry and eggs, an automobile company produces automobiles and trucks, and a uni-versity produces teaching and research. At other times, firms produce physically unrelated products. In both cases, however, a firm is likely to enjoy production or cost advantages when it produces two or more products. These advantages could result from the joint use of inputs or production facilities, joint marketing programs, or possibly the cost savings of a common administration. In some cases, the production of one product yields an automatic and unavoidable by-product that is valuable to the firm. For example, sheet metal manufacturers produce scrap metal and shavings that they can sell.
Product Transformation Curves
To study the economic advantages of joint production, let’s consider an automo-bile company that produces two products, cars and tractors. Both products use capital (factories and machinery) and labor as inputs. Cars and tractors are not typically produced at the same plant, but they do share management resources, and both rely on similar machinery and skilled labor. The managers of the com-pany must choose how much of each product to produce. Figure 7.11 shows two product transformation curves,  each showing the various combinations of cars 
and tractors that can be produced with a given input of labor and machinery. Curve O
1 describes all combinations of the two outputs that can be produced 
with a relatively low level of inputs, and curve O2 describes the output combina-
tions associated with twice the inputs.
Why does the product transformation curve have a negative slope? Because 
in order to get more of one output, the firm must give up some of the other output. For example, a firm that emphasizes car production will devote less of its resources to producing tractors. In Figure 7.11, curve O
2 lies twice as far from 
the origin as curve O1, signifying that this firm’s production process exhibits 
constant returns to scale in the production of both commodities.• product transformation 
curve  Curve showing the 
various combinations of two different outputs (products) that can be produced with a given set of inputs.CHAPTER 7   •  The Cost of Production  259
If curve O1 were a straight line, joint production would entail no gains (or 
losses). One smaller company specializing in cars and another in tractors would generate the same output as a single company producing both. However, the product transformation curve is bowed outward (or concave ) because joint pro-
duction usually has advantages that enable a single company to produce more cars and tractors with the same resources than would two companies producing each product separately. These production advantages involve the joint sharing of inputs. A single management, for example, is often able to schedule and orga-nize production and to handle accounting and financial activities more effec-tively than separate managements.
Economies and Diseconomies of Scope
In general, economies of scope  are present when the joint output of a single 
firm is greater than the output that could be achieved by two different firms each producing a single product (with equivalent production inputs allocated between them). If a firm’s joint output is less than that which could be achieved 
by separate firms, then its production process involves diseconomies of scope.  
This possibility could occur if the production of one product somehow con-flicted with the production of the second.
There is no direct relationship between economies of scale and economies of 
scope. A two-output firm can enjoy economies of scope even if its production pro-cess involves diseconomies of scale. Suppose, for example, that manufacturing flutes and piccolos jointly is cheaper than producing both separately. Yet the production process involves highly skilled labor and is most effective if undertaken on a small scale. Likewise, a joint-product firm can have economies of scale for each individual product yet not enjoy economies of scope. Imagine, for example, a large conglomer-ate that owns several firms that produce efficiently on a large scale but that do not take advantage of economies of scope because they are administered separately.
The Degree of Economies of Scope
The extent to which there are economies of scope can also be determined by studying a firm’s costs. If a combination of inputs used by one firm generates more output than two independent firms would produce, then it costs less • economies of scope

for a single firm to produce both products than it would cost the independent 
firms. To measure the degree  to which there are economies of scope, we should 
ask what percentage of the cost of production is saved when two (or more) products are produced jointly rather than individually. Equation (7.7) gives the degree of economies of scope (SC)  that measures this savings in cost:
 SC = C(q
1)+C(q2)-C(q1, q2)
C(q1, q2) (7.7)
C(q1) represents the cost of producing only output q1, C(q2) represents the cost of 
producing only output q2, and C(q1, q2) the joint cost of producing both outputs. 
When the physical units of output can be added, as in the car–tractor example, the expression becomes C(q
1+q2). With economies of scope, the joint cost is less 
than the sum of the individual costs. Thus, SC is greater than 0. With disecono-mies of scope, SC is negative. In general, the larger the value of SC, the greater the economies of scope.• degree of economies of 
scope (SC)  Percentage of cost 
savings resulting when two or more products are produced jointly rather than individually.

Efficient Market Structure,” Review of Economics and Statistics  67 (1985): 250–58.EXAMPLE 7.6  ECONOMIES OF SCOPE IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY
Suppose that you are managing a 
trucking firm that hauls loads of dif-ferent sizes between cities.
11 In the 
trucking business, several related but distinct products can be offered, depending on the size of the load and the length of the haul. First, any load, small or large, can be taken directly from one location to another without intermediate stops. Second, a load can be combined with other loads (which may go between different locations) and eventually be shipped indirectly from its origin to the appropriate destination. Each type of load, partial or full, may involve different lengths of haul.
This range of possibilities raises questions about 
both economies of scale and economies of scope. The scale question asks whether large-scale, direct hauls are cheaper and more profitable than individual hauls by small truckers. The scope question asks whether a large trucking firm enjoys cost advantages in operat-ing both direct quick hauls and indirect, slower (but less expensive) hauls. Central planning and organiza-tion of routes could provide for  economies of scope. 
The key to the presence of economies of scale is the fact that the  organization of routes 
and the types of hauls we have described can be accomplished more efficiently when many hauls are involved. In such cases, a firm is more likely to be able to schedule hauls in which most truckloads are full rather than half-full.
Studies of the trucking industry 
show that economies of scope are 
present. For example, one analysis of 105 trucking firms looked at four distinct outputs: (1) short hauls with partial loads, (2) intermediate hauls with partial loads, (3) long hauls with partial loads, and (4) hauls with total loads. The results indicate that the degree of economies of scope SC was 1.576 for a reason-ably large firm. However, the degree of economies of scope falls to 0.104 when the firm becomes very large. Because large firms carry sufficiently large truckloads, there is usually no advantage to stop-ping at an intermediate terminal to fill a partial load. A direct trip from the origin to the destination is sufficient. Apparently, however, because other disadvantages are  associated with the manage-
ment of very large firms, the  economies of scope 
CHAPTER 7   •  The Cost of Production  261
*7.6   Dynamic Changes in Costs—
The Learning Curve
Our discussion thus far has suggested one reason why a large firm may have 
a lower long-run average cost than a small firm: increasing returns to scale in production. It is tempting to conclude that firms that enjoy lower average cost over time are growing firms with increasing returns to scale. But this need not be true. In some firms, long-run average cost may decline over time because workers and managers absorb new technological information as they become more experienced at their jobs.
As management and labor gain experience with production, the firm’s mar-
ginal and average costs of producing a given level of output fall for four reasons:
 1. Workers often take longer to accomplish a given task the first few times 
they do it. As they become more adept, their speed increases.
 2. Managers learn to schedule the production process more effectively, from 
the flow of materials to the organization of the manufacturing itself.
 3. Engineers who are initially cautious in their product designs may gain 
enough experience to be able to allow for tolerances in design that save costs without increasing defects. Better and more specialized tools and plant organization may also lower cost.
 4. Suppliers may learn how to process required materials more effectively 
and pass on some of this advantage in the form of lower costs.
As a consequence, a firm “learns” over time as cumulative output 
increases. Managers can use this learning process to help plan production and forecast future costs. Figure 7.11 illustrates this process in the form of a learning curve —a curve that describes the relationship between a firm’s 
cumulative output and the amount of inputs needed to produce each unit of output.
Graphing the Learning Curve
Figure 7.12 shows a learning curve for the production of machine tools. The horizontal axis measures the cumulative  number of lots of machine tools (groups 
of approximately 40) that the firm has produced. The vertical axis shows the number of hours of labor needed to produce each lot. Labor input per unit of output directly affects the production cost because the fewer the hours of labor needed, the lower the marginal and average cost of production.
The learning curve in Figure 7.12 is based on the relationship

relating amount of inputs needed by a firm to produce each unit of output to its cumulative output.get smaller as the firm gets bigger. In any event, 
the ability to combine partial loads at an intermedi-ate location lowers the firm’s costs and increases its profitability.The study suggests, therefore, that to compete in 
the trucking industry, a firm must be large enough to be able to combine loads at intermediate stop-ping points.262  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
where N is the cumulative units of output produced and L the labor input per 
unit of output. A, B, and b are constants, with A and B positive, and b between 0 
and 1. When N is equal to 1, L is equal to A /H11001 B, so that A /H11001 B measures the labor 
input required to produce the first unit of output. When b equals 0, labor input 
per unit of output remains the same as the cumulative level of output increases; there is no learning. When b is positive and N gets larger and larger, L becomes 
arbitrarily close to A. A, therefore, represents the minimum labor input per unit 
of output after all learning has taken place.
The larger b is, the more important the learning effect. With b equal to 0.5, for 
example, the labor input per unit of output falls proportionately to the square root of the cumulative output. This degree of learning can substantially reduce production costs as a firm becomes more experienced.
In this machine tool example, the value of b is 0.31. For this particular learning 
curve, every doubling in cumulative output causes the input requirement (less the minimum attainable input requirement) to fall by about 20 percent.
12 As Figure 7.12 
shows, the learning curve drops sharply as the cumulative number of lots increases to about 20. Beyond an output of 20 lots, the cost savings are relatively small.
Learning versus Economies of Scale
Once the firm has produced 20 or more machine lots, the entire effect of the learning curve would be complete, and we could use the usual analysis of cost. If, however, the production process were relatively new, relatively high cost at low levels of output (and relatively low cost at higher levels) would indicate learning effects, not economies of scale. With learning, the cost of pro-duction for a mature firm is relatively low regardless of the scale of the firm’s operation. If a firm that produces machine tools in lots knows that it enjoys economies of scale, it should produce its machines in very large lots to take advantage of the lower cost associated with size. If there is a learning curve, 
12Because ( L − A) /H11005 BN−.31, we can check that 0.8( L − A) is approximately equal to B(2N)−.31.Hours of  labor

THE LEARNING CURVE
A firm’s production cost may fall over 
time as managers and workers be-come more experienced and more ef-fective at using the available plant and equipment. The learning curve shows the extent to which hours of labor needed per unit of output fall as the cumulative output increases.CHAPTER 7   •  The Cost of Production  263
the firm can lower its cost by scheduling the production of many lots regard-
less of individual lot size.
Figure 7.13 shows this phenomenon. AC1 represents the long-run average 
cost of production of a firm that enjoys economies of scale in production. Thus the increase in the rate of output from A to B along AC
1 leads to lower cost due 
to economies of scale. However, the move from A on AC1 to C on AC2 leads to 
lower cost due to learning, which shifts the average cost curve downward.
The learning curve is crucial for a firm that wants to predict the cost of produc-
ing a new product. Suppose, for example, that a firm producing machine tools knows that its labor requirement per machine for the first 10 machines is 1.0, the minimum labor requirement A is equal to zero, and b is approximately equal to 
0.32. Table 7.3 calculates the total labor requirement for producing 80 machines.
Because there is a learning curve, the per-unit labor requirement falls with 
increased production. As a result, the total labor requirement for  producing OutputCost

more and more output increases in smaller and smaller increments. Therefore, 
a firm looking only at the high initial labor requirement will obtain an overly pessimistic view of the business. Suppose the firm plans to be in business for a long time, producing 10 units per year. Suppose the total labor require-ment for the first year’s production is 10. In the first year of production, the firm’s cost will be high as it learns the business. But once the learning effect has taken place, production costs will fall. After 8 years, the labor required to produce 10 units will be only 5.1, and per-unit cost will be roughly half what it was in the first year of production. Thus, the learning curve can be important for a firm deciding whether it is profitable to enter an industry.
13The study was conducted by Marvin Lieberman, “The Learning Curve and Pricing in the Chemical 
Processing Industries,” RAND Journal of Economics  15 (1984): 213–28.
14The author used the average cost AC of the chemical products, the cumulative industry output X, 
and the average scale of a production plant Z. He then estimated the relationship log (AC)  /H11005 −0.387 
log ( X) −0.173 log ( Z). The −0.387 coefficient on cumulative output tells us that for every 1-percent 
increase in cumulative output, average cost decreases 0.387 percent. The −0.173 coefficient on plant size tells us that for every 1-percent increase in plant size, average cost decreases 0.173 percent.
By interpreting the two coefficients in light of the output and plant-size variables, we can allo-
cate about 15 percent of the cost reduction to increases in the average scale of plants and 85 percent to increases in cumulative industry output. Suppose plant scale doubled while cumulative output increased by a factor of 5 during the study. In that case, costs would fall by 11 percent from the increased scale and by 62 percent from the increase in cumulative output.EXAMPLE 7.7  THE LEARNING CURVE IN PRACTICE
Suppose that you are the man-
ager of a firm that has just entered the chemical processing industry. You face the following problem: Should you produce a relatively small quantity of industrial chemi-cals and sell them at a high price, or should you increase your out-put and reduce your price? The second alternative is appealing if you expect to move down a learning curve: the increased volume will lower your average produc-tion costs over time and increase your profit.
Before proceeding, you should determine whether 
there is indeed a learning curve; if so, producing and selling a higher volume will lower your average pro-duction costs over time and increase profitability. You also need to distinguish learning from econo-mies of scale. With economies of scale, average cost is lower when output at any point in time is higher, whereas with learning average cost declines as the cumulative output of the firm increases. By produc-ing relatively small volumes over and over, you move down the learning curve, but you don’t get much in the way of scale  economies. The opposite is the case if you produce large volumes 
at one point in time, but you don’t have the opportunity to repeat that experience over time.
To decide what to do, you can 
examine the available statisti-cal evidence that distinguishes the components of the learning curve (learning new processes by labor, engineering improve-
ments, etc.) from increasing returns to scale. For example, a study of 37 chemical products reveals that cost reductions in the chemical processing industry are directly tied to the growth of cumulative industry output, to investment in improved capital equipment, and, to a lesser extent, to economies of scale.
13 In fact, for the entire sample of chemical 
products, average costs of production fall at 5.5 per-cent per year. The study reveals that for each dou-bling of plant scale, the average cost of production falls by 11 percent. For each doubling of cumulative output, however, the average cost of production falls by 27 percent. The evidence shows clearly that learning effects are more important than economies of scale in the chemical processing industry.
14
CHAPTER 7   •  The Cost of Production  265
The learning curve has also been shown to be 
important in the semiconductor industry. A study of seven generations of dynamic random-access mem-ory (DRAM) semiconductors from 1974 to 1992 found that the learning rates averaged about 20 percent; thus a 10-percent increase in cumulative production would lead to a 2-percent decrease in cost.
15 The 
study also compared learning by firms in Japan to firms in the United States and found that there was no distinguishable difference in the speed of learning.
Another example is the aircraft industry, where 
studies have found learning rates that are as high as 40 percent. This is illustrated in Figure 7.14, which shows the labor requirements for producing aircraft by Airbus Industrie. Observe that the first 10 or 20 
airplanes require far more labor to produce than the hundredth or two hundredth airplane. Also note how the learning curve flattens out after a certain point; in this case nearly all learning is complete after 200 airplanes have been built.
Learning-curve effects can be important in deter-
mining the shape of long-run cost curves and can thus help guide management decisions. Managers can use learning-curve information to decide whether a production operation is profitable and, if so, how to plan how large the plant operation and the volume of cumulative output need be to gener-ate a positive cash flow.100 0100

*7.7  Estimating and Predicting Cost
A business that is expanding or contracting its operation must predict how costs 
will change as output changes. Estimates of future costs can be obtained from a cost function,  which relates the cost of production to the level of output and 
other variables that the firm can control.• cost function  Function

15The study was conducted by D. A. Irwin and P . J. Klenow, “Learning-by-Doing Spillovers in the 
Semiconductor Industry,” Journal of Political Economy  102 (December 1994): 1200–27.266  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
Suppose we wanted to characterize the short-run cost of production in 
the automobile industry. We could obtain data on the number of automo-biles Q produced by each car company and relate this information to the 
company’s variable cost of production VC. The use of variable cost, rather than total cost, avoids the problem of trying to allocate the fixed cost of a multiproduct firm’s production process to the particular product being studied.
16
Figure 7.15 shows a typical pattern of cost and output data. Each point on 
the graph relates the output of an auto company to that company’s variable cost of production. To predict cost accurately, we must determine the underlying relationship between variable cost and output. Then, if a company expands its production, we can calculate what the associated cost is likely to be. The curve in the figure is drawn with this in mind—it provides a reasonably close fit to the cost data. (Typically, least-squares regression analysis would be used to fit the curve to the data.) But what shape is the most appropriate, and how do we represent that shape algebraically?
Here is one cost function that we might choose:
 VC =bq (7.9)
Although easy to use, this linear  relationship between cost and output 
is applicable only if marginal cost is constant.
17 For every unit increase in 
 output, variable cost increases by b; marginal cost is thus constant and 
equal to b.
If we wish to allow for a U-shaped average cost curve and a marginal cost 
that is not constant, we must use a more complex cost function. One possibility Least-squares regression is 
explained in the appendix to 
this book.
16If an additional piece of equipment is needed as output increases, then the annual rental cost of the 
equipment should be counted as a variable cost. If, however, the same machine can be used at all output levels, its cost is fixed and should not be included.
17In statistical cost analyses, other variables might be added to the cost function to account for differ-
ences in input costs, production processes, production mix, etc., among firms.General Motors

VARIABLE COST CURVE FOR THE  
AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY
An empirical estimate of the variable cost curve can 
be obtained by using data for individual firms in an industry. The variable cost curve for automobile pro-duction is obtained by determining statistically the curve that best fits the points that relate the output of each firm to the firm’s variable cost of production.CHAPTER 7   •  The Cost of Production  267
is the quadratic  cost function, which relates variable cost to output and output 
squared:
 VC =bq+gq2 (7.10)
This function implies a straight-line marginal cost curve of the form 
MC=b+2gq.18 Marginal cost increases with output if g is positive and 
decreases with output if g is negative.
If the marginal cost curve is not linear, we might use a cubic  cost function:
 VC =bq+gq2+dq3 (7.11)
Figure 7.16 shows this cubic cost function. It implies U-shaped marginal as 
well as average cost curves.
Cost functions can be difficult to measure for several reasons. First, output 
data often represent an aggregate of different types of products. The automo-biles produced by General Motors, for example, involve different models of cars. Second, cost data are often obtained directly from accounting information that fails to reflect opportunity costs. Third, allocating maintenance and other plant costs to a particular product is difficult when the firm is a conglomerate that produces more than one product line.
Cost Functions and the Measurement  
of Scale Economies
Recall that the cost-output elasticity EC is less than one when there are econo-
mies of scale and greater than one when there are diseconomies of scale. The scale economies index (SCI)  provides an index of whether or not there are scale 
economies. SCI is defined as follows:
 SCI =1-E
C (7.12)
When EC=1, SCI =0 and there are no economies or diseconomies of scale. 
When EC is greater than one, SCI is negative and there are diseconomies of 
scale. Finally, when EC is less than 1, SCI is positive and there are economies of 
scale.
18Short-run marginal cost is given by /H9004VC/ /H9004q=b+g/H9004(q2). But /H9004(q2)//H9004q=2q. (Check this by 
using calculus or by numerical example.) Therefore, MC =b+2gq.MC = ß + 2γq + 3δq2

EXAMPLE 7.8  COST FUNCTIONS FOR ELECTRIC 
POWER
In 1955, consumers bought 369 billion  
kilowatt-hours (kwh) of electricity; in 1970 they bought 1083 billion. Because there were fewer electric utilities in 1970, the output per firm had increased substantially. Was this increase due to economies of scale or to other factors?  
If it was the result of economies of scale, it would be economically inefficient for regula-tors to “break up” electric utility monopolies.
An interesting study of scale econo-
mies was based on the years 1955 and 1970 for investor-owned utilities with more than $1 million in revenues.
19 The cost of electric power was esti-
mated by using a cost function that is somewhat more sophisticated than the quadratic and cubic functions discussed earlier.
20 Table 7.4 shows the 
resulting estimates of the scale economies index. The results are based on a classification of all utilities into five size categories, with the median output  (measured in kilowatt-hours) in each category listed.
The positive values of SCI tell us that all sizes of firms had some econo-
mies of scale in 1955. However, the magnitude of the economies of scale diminishes as firm size increases. The average cost curve associated with the 1955 study is drawn in Figure 7.17 and labeled 1955. The point of minimum average cost occurs at point A, at an  output of approximately 
20 billion kilowatts. Because there were no firms of this size in 1955, no firm had exhausted the opportunity for returns to scale in production. Note, however, that the average cost curve is relatively flat from an output of  
9 billion kilowatts and higher, a range in which 7 of 124 firms produced.
When the same cost functions were estimated with 1970 data, the cost 
curve labeled 1970 in Figure 7.17 was the result. The graph shows clearly that the average costs of production fell from 1955 to 1970. (The data are in real 1970 dollars.) But the flat part of the curve now begins at about 15 billion kwh. By 1970, 24 of 80 firms were producing in this range. Thus, many more firms were operating in the flat portion of the average cost curve in which economies of scale are not an important phenomenon. More important, most of the firms were producing in a portion of the 1970 cost curve that was flatter than their point of operation on the 1955 curve. (Five firms were at points of diseconomies of scale: Consolidated Edison [SCI =-0.003],

AVERAGE COST OF PRODUCTION IN THE ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY
The average cost of electric power in 1955 achieved a minimum at approximately 20 billion kilo-
watt-hours. By 1970 the average cost of production had fallen sharply and achieved a minimum at an output of more than 33 billion kilowatt-hours.
SUMMARY
 1. Managers, investors, and economists must take into 
account the opportunity cost  associated with the use of 
a firm’s resources: the cost associated with the oppor-tunities forgone when the firm uses its resources in its next best alternative.
 2. Economic cost  is the cost to a firm of utilizing economic 
resources in production. While economic cost and opportunity cost are identical concepts, opportunity cost is particularly useful in situations when alternatives that are forgone do not reflect monetary outlays.
 3. A sunk cost  is an expenditure that has been made and 
cannot be recovered. After it has been incurred, it should be ignored when making future economic decisions. 
Because an expenditure that is sunk has no alternative use, its opportunity cost is zero.
 4. In the short run, one or more of a firm’s inputs are 
fixed. Total cost can be divided into fixed cost and variable cost. A firm’s marginal cost  is the additional 
variable cost associated with each additional unit of output. The average variable cost  is the total variable 
cost divided by the number of units of output.
 5. In the short run, when not all inputs are variable, the 
presence of diminishing returns determines the shape of the cost curves. In particular, there is an inverse Detroit Edison [SCI =-0.004], Duke Power [SCI =-0.012] , Commonwealth 
Edison [SCI =-0.014], and Southern [SCI =-0.028].) Thus, unexploited 
scale economies were much smaller in 1970 than in 1955.
This cost function analysis makes it clear that the decline in the cost of produc-
ing electric power cannot be explained by the ability of larger firms to take advan-tage of economies of scale. Rather, improvements in technology unrelated to the scale of the firms’ operation and the decline in the real cost of energy inputs, such as coal and oil, are important reasons for the lower costs. The tendency toward lower average cost reflecting a movement to the right along an average cost curve is minimal compared with the effect of technological improvement.270  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW
 1. A firm pays its accountant an annual retainer of 
$10,000. Is this an economic cost?
 2. The owner of a small retail store does her own account-
ing work. How would you measure the opportunity cost of her work?
 3. Please explain whether the following statements are 
true or false.
 a. If the owner of a business pays himself no salary, 
then the accounting cost is zero, but the economic cost is positive.
 b. A firm that has positive accounting profit does not 
necessarily have positive economic profit.
 c. If a firm hires a currently unemployed worker, the 
opportunity cost of utilizing the worker’s services is zero.
 4. Suppose that labor is the only variable input to the 
production process. If the marginal cost of production is diminishing as more units of output are produced, what can you say about the marginal product of labor?
 5. Suppose a chair manufacturer finds that the marginal 
rate of technical substitution of capital for labor in her production process is substantially greater than the ratio of the rental rate on machinery to the wage rate for assembly-line labor. How should she alter her use of capital and labor to minimize the cost of production? 6. Why are isocost lines straight lines?
 7. Assume that the marginal cost of production is increas-
ing. Can you determine whether the average variable cost is increasing or decreasing? Explain.
 8. Assume that the marginal cost of production is greater 
than the average variable cost. Can you determine whether the average variable cost is increasing or decreasing? Explain.
 9. If the firm’s average cost curves are U-shaped, why 
does its average variable cost curve achieve its mini-mum at a lower level of output than the average total cost curve?
 10. If a firm enjoys economies of scale up to a certain out-
put level, and cost then increases proportionately with output, what can you say about the shape of the long-run average cost curve?
 11. How does a change in the price of one input change 
the firm’s long-run expansion path?
 12. Distinguish between economies of scale and econo-
mies of scope. Why can one be present without the other?
 13. Is the firm’s expansion path always a straight line?
 14. What is the difference between economies of scale and 
returns to scale? relationship between the marginal product of a single 
variable input and the marginal cost of production. The average variable cost and average total cost curves are U-shaped. The short-run marginal cost curve 
increases beyond a certain point, and cuts both aver-age cost curves from below at their minimum points.
 6. In the long run, all inputs to the production process are 
variable. As a result, the choice of inputs depends both on the relative costs of the factors of production and on the extent to which the firm can substitute among inputs in its production process. The cost-minimizing input choice is made by finding the point of tangency between the isoquant representing the level of desired 
output and an isocost line.
 7. The firm’s expansion path  shows how its cost-mini-
mizing input choices vary as the scale or output of its operation increases. As a result, the expansion path provides useful information relevant for long-run planning decisions.
 8. The long-run average cost curve is the envelope of the 
firm’s short-run average cost curves, and it reflects the presence or absence of returns to scale. When there are increasing returns to scale initially and then  decreasing returns to scale, the long-run average cost curve is U-shaped, and the envelope does not include 
all points of minimum short-run average cost. 9. A firm enjoys economies of scale  when it can double its 
output at less than twice the cost. Correspondingly, there are diseconomies of scale when a doubling of output requires more than twice the cost. Scale econo-mies and diseconomies apply even when input pro-portions are variable; returns to scale apply only when input proportions are fixed.
 10. Economies of scope arise when the firm can produce 
any combination of the two outputs more cheaply than could two independent firms that each produced a single output. The degree of economies of scope is measured by the percentage reduction in cost when one firm produces two products relative to the cost of producing them individually.
 11. A firm’s average cost of production can fall over time 
if the firm “learns” how to produce more effectively. The learning curve  shows how much the input needed 
to produce a given output falls as the cumulative out-put of the firm increases.
 12. Cost functions relate the cost of production to the 
firm’s level of output. The functions can be measured in both the short run and the long run by using either data for firms in an industry at a given time or data for an industry over time. A number of functional rela-tionships, including linear, quadratic, and cubic, can be used to represent cost functions.CHAPTER 7   •  The Cost of Production  271

 5. A recent issue of Business Week  reported the following:
During the recent auto sales slump, GM, Ford, 
and Chrysler decided it was cheaper to sell cars 
to rental companies at a loss than to lay off work-ers. That’s because closing and reopening plants is expensive, partly because the auto makers’ current union contracts obligate them to pay many work-
ers even if they’re not working.
When the article discusses selling cars “at a loss,” is it 
referring to accounting profit or economic profit? How will the two differ in this case? Explain briefly.
 6. Suppose the economy takes a downturn, and that 
labor costs fall by 50 percent and are expected to stay at that level for a long time. Show graphically how this change in the relative price of labor and capital affects the firm’s expansion path.

Production and Cost Theory— 
A Mathematical Treatment
This appendix presents a mathematical treatment of the basics of production 
and cost theory. As in the appendix to Chapter 4, we use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve the firm’s cost-minimizing problem.
Cost Minimization
The theory of the firm relies on the assumption that firms choose inputs to the production process that minimize the cost of producing output. If there are two inputs, capital K and labor L, the production function F(K, L) describes the maxi-
mum output that can be produced for every possible combination of inputs. We assume that each factor in the production process has positive but decreasing marginal products. Therefore, writing the marginal product of capital and labor as MP
K(K, L) and MPL(K, L), respectively, it follows that
MP K(K,L)= 0F(K, L)
0K 70,  02F(K, L)
0K2 60
MP L(K,L)= 0F(K, L)
0L 70,  02F(K, L)
0L2 60
A competitive firm takes the prices of both labor w and capital r as given. 
Then the cost-minimization problem can be written as
 Minimize C=wL+rK (A7.1)
subject to the constraint that a fixed output q0 be produced:
 F(K, L)=q0 (A7.2)
C represents the cost of producing the fixed level of output q0.
To determine the firm’s demand for capital and labor inputs, we choose the 
values of K and L that minimize (A7.1) subject to (A7.2). We can solve this con-
strained optimization problem in three steps using the method discussed in the appendix to Chapter 4:
• Step 1: Set up the Lagrangian, which is the sum of two components: the cost 
of production (to be minimized) and the Lagrange multiplier 
l times the out-
put constraint faced by the firm:
 /H9021=wL+rK-l[F(K, L)-q0] (A7.3)
• Step 2: Differentiate the Lagrangian with respect to K, L, and l. Then equate the 
resulting derivatives to zero to obtain the necessary conditions for a  minimum.1
1These conditions are necessary for a solution involving positive amounts of both inputs. 273274  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
0/H9021/0K=r-lMP K(K, L)=0
 0/H9021/0L=w-lMP L(K, L)=0 (A7.4)
 0/H9021/0l=q0-F(K, L)=0 
• Step 3:  In general, these equations can be solved to obtain the optimizing 
values of L, K, and l. It is particularly instructive to combine the first two 
conditions in (A7.4) to obtain
 MP K(K, L)/r=MP L(K, L)/w (A7.5)
Equation (A7.5) tells us that if the firm is minimizing costs, it will choose its 
factor inputs to equate the ratio of the marginal product of each factor divided by its price. This is exactly the same condition that we derived as Equation 7.4 (page 247) in the text.
Finally, we can rewrite the first two conditions of (A7.4) to evaluate the 
Lagrange multiplier:
 r-lMP
K(K, L)=01l= r
MP K(K, L)
  w-lMP L(K, L)=01l= w
MP L(K, L) (A7.6)
Suppose output increases by one unit. Because the marginal product of capital meas-
ures the extra output associated with an additional input of capital, 1/MPK(K, L) 
measures the extra capital needed to produce one unit of output. Therefore,  r/MP
K(K, L) measures the additional input cost of producing an additional unit of 
output by increasing capital. Likewise, w/MPL(K, L) measures the additional cost 
of producing a unit of output using additional labor as an input. In both cases, the Lagrange multiplier is equal to the marginal cost of production because it tells us how much the cost increases if the amount produced is increased by one unit.
Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution
Recall that an isoquant  is a curve that represents the set of all input combinations 
that give the firm the same level of output—say, q0. Thus, the condition that 
F(K, L) /H11005 q0 represents a production isoquant. As input combinations are 
changed along an isoquant, the change in output, given by the total derivative of F(K, L), equals zero (i.e., d q /H11005 0). Thus
 MP
K(K, L)dK+MP L(K, L)dL=dq=0 (A7.7)
It follows by rearrangement that -dK/dL=MRTS
LK=MP L(K, L)/MP K(K, L) (A7.8)
where MRTSLK is the firm’s marginal rate of technical substitution between labor 
and capital.
Now, rewrite the condition given by (A7.5) to get
 MP L(K, L)/MP K(K, L)=w/r (A7.9)CHAPTER 7   •  The Cost of Production  275
Because the left side of (A7.8) represents the negative of the slope of the iso-
quant, it follows that at the point of tangency of the isoquant and the isocost line, the firm’s marginal rate of technical substitution (which trades off inputs while keeping output constant) is equal to the ratio of the input prices (which represents the slope of the firm’s isocost line).
We can look at this result another way by rewriting (A7.9):
 MP
L/w=MP K/r (A7.10)
Equation (A7.10) is the same as (A7.5) and tells us that the marginal products of 
all production inputs must be equal when these marginal products are adjusted by the unit cost of each input.
Duality in Production and Cost Theory
As in consumer theory, the firm’s input decision has a dual nature. The opti-mum choice of K and L can be analyzed not only as the problem of choosing 
the lowest isocost line tangent to the production isoquant, but also as the prob-lem of choosing the highest production isoquant tangent to a given isocost line. Suppose we wish to spend C
0 on production. The dual problem asks what com-
bination of K and L will let us produce the most output at a cost of C0. We can see 
the equivalence of the two approaches by solving the following problem:
Maximize F(K, L) subject to wL+rL=C0 (A7.11)
We can solve this problem using the Lagrangian method:
• Step 1: We set up the Lagrangian
 /H9021=F(K, L)-o(wL+rK-C0) (A7.12)
 where μ is the Lagrange multiplier.
• Step 2: We differentiate the Lagrangian with respect to K, L, and o and set the 
resulting equation equal to zero to find the necessary conditions for a maximum:
 0/H9021
0K=MP K(K, L)-or=0
  0/H9021
0L=MP L(K, L)-ow=0 (A7.13)
 0/H9021
0l=wL-rK+C0=0
• Step 3: Normally, we can use the equations of (A7.13) to solve for K and L. In 
particular, we combine the first two equations to see that
  o=MP K(K, L)

  o=MP L(K, L)

This is the same result as (A7.5)—that is, the necessary condition for cost 
 minimization.
The Cobb-Douglas Cost and Production Functions
Given a specific production function F(K, L), conditions (A7.13) and (A7.14) can be 
used to derive the cost function C (q). To understand this principle, let’s work through 
the example of a Cobb-Douglas production function.  This production function is
F(K,L)=AKaLb
where A, a, and b are positive constants.
We assume that a61 and b61, so that the firm has decreasing marginal 
products of labor and capital.2 If a+b=1, the firm has constant returns to scale , 
because doubling K and L doubles F. If a+b71, the firm has increasing returns 
to scale , and if a+b61, it has decreasing returns to scale.
As an application, consider the carpet industry described in Example 6.4 (page 
221). The production of both small and large firms can be described by Cobb-Douglas production functions. For small firms, a=.77 and b=.23. Because 
a+b=1, there are constant returns to scale. For larger firms, however, a=.83 
and b=.22. Thus a+b=1.05, and there are increasing returns to scale. The 
Cobb-Douglas production function is frequently encountered in economics and can be used to model many kinds of production. We have already seen how it can accommodate differences in returns to scale. It can also account for changes in technology or productivity through changes in the value of A: The larger the 
value of A, more can be produced for a given level of K and L.
To find the amounts of capital and labor that the firm should utilize to mini-
mize the cost of producing an output q
0, we first write the Lagrangian
 /H9021=wL+rK-l(AKaLb-q0) (A7.15)
Differentiating with respect to L, K, and l, and setting those derivatives equal 
to 0, we obtain
 0/H9021/0L=w-l(bAKaLb-1)=0 (A7.16)
 0/H9021/0K=r-l(aAKa-1Lb)=0 (A7.17)
 0/H9021/0l=AKaLb-q0=0  (A7.18)
From equation (A7.16) we have l=w/AbK
aLb-1 (A7.19)
Substituting this formula into equation (A7.17) gives us rbAK

2For example, the marginal product of labor is given by MP L=0[F(K,L)]/0L=bAKaLb-1. Thus, 
MPL falls as L increases.CHAPTER 7   •  The Cost of Production  277

(A7.24) is the factor demand for capital. We have now determined the cost-min-
imizing quantity of capital: Thus, if we wish to produce q0 units of output at 
least cost, (A7.24) tells us how much capital we should employ as part of our production plan. To determine the cost-minimizing quantity of labor, we simply substitute equation (A7.24) into equation (A7.21):

(A7.25) is the constrained factor demand for labor. Note that if the wage rate 
w rises relative to the price of capital r, the firm will use more capital and less 
labor. Suppose that, because of technological change, A increases (so the firm can 
produce more output with the same inputs); in that case, both K and L will fall.
We have shown how cost-minimization subject to an output constraint can 
be used to determine the firm’s optimal mix of capital and labor. Now we will determine the firm’s cost function. The total cost of producing any output q  can 
be obtained by substituting equations (A7.24) for K and (A7.25) for L into the 
equation C /H11005 wL /H11001 rK. After some algebraic manipulation we find that

number of computerized stitching-machine hours, and L the number of person-hours of labor. In addition to capital and labor, $10 worth of raw materials is used 
in the production of each parka.
 a. By minimizing cost subject to the production func-
tion, derive the cost-minimizing demands for K and L 
as a function of output ( q), wage rates ( w), and rental 
rates on machines ( r). Use these results to derive the 
total cost function: that is, costs as a function of q, r, w, 
and the constant $10 per unit materials cost.
 b. This process requires skilled workers, who earn $32 
per hour. The rental rate on the machines used in the process is $64 per hour. At these factor prices, what are total costs as a function of q? Does this 
technology exhibit decreasing, constant, or increas-ing returns to scale?
 c. Polly’s Parkas plans to produce 2000 parkas per 
week. At the factor prices given above, how many workers should the firm hire (at 40 hours per week) and how many machines should it rent (at 40 machine-hours per week)? What are the marginal and average costs at this level of production?In this case, therefore, cost will increase proportionately with output. As a result, 
the production process exhibits constant returns to scale. Likewise, if a+b is 
greater than 1, there are increasing returns to scale; if a+b is less than 1, there 
are decreasing returns to scale.
The firm’s cost function contains many desirable features. To appreciate this 
fact, consider the special constant returns to scale cost function (A7.27). Suppose that we wish to produce q
0 in output but are faced with a doubling of the wage. 
How should we expect our costs to change? New costs are given by

Therefore, C162C0. Even though wages doubled, the cost of producing q0 less 
than doubled. This is the expected result. If a firm suddenly had to pay more for labor, it would substitute away from labor and employ more of the relatively cheaper capital, thereby keeping the increase in total cost in check.
Now consider the dual problem of maximizing the output that can be pro-
duced with the expenditure of C
0 dollars. We leave it to you to work through 
this problem for the Cobb-Douglas production function. You should be able to show that equations (A7.24) and (A7.25) describe the cost-minimizing input choices. To get you started, note that the Lagrangian for this dual problem is
/H9021=AK
aLb-o(wL+rK-C0). 279
A cost curve describes the minimum cost at which a firm can pro-
duce various amounts of output. Once we know its cost curve, we can turn to a fundamental problem faced by every firm: 
How much should be produced ? In this chapter, we will see how a firm 
chooses the level of output that maximizes its profit. We will also see how the output choices of individual firms lead to a supply curve for an entire industry.
Because our discussion of production and cost in Chapters 6 and 7 
applies to firms in all kinds of markets, we will begin by explaining the profit-maximizing output decision in a general setting. However, we will then turn to the focus of this chapter— perfectly competitive markets , 
in which all firms produce an identical product and each is so small in relation to the industry that its production decisions have no effect on market price. New firms can easily enter the industry if they perceive a potential for profit, and existing firms can exit if they start losing money.
We begin by explaining exactly what is meant by a competitive mar-
ket. We then explain why it makes sense to assume that firms (in any 
market) have the objective of maximizing profit. We provide a rule for choosing the profit-maximizing output for firms in all markets, com-petitive or otherwise. Following this we show how a competitive firm chooses its output in the short and long run.
We next examine how the firm’s output choice changes as the cost 
of production or the prices of inputs change. In this way, we show how to derive the firm’s supply curve.  We then aggregate the supply curves 
of individual firms to obtain the industry supply curve.  In the short run, 
firms in an industry choose which level of output to produce in order to maximize profit. In the long run, they not only make output choices, but also decide whether to be in a market at all. We will see that while the prospect of high profits encourages firms to enter an industry, losses encourage them to leave.

product was determined by the intersection of the market demand and market 
supply curves. Underlying this analysis is the model of a perfectly competitive 
market.  The model of perfect competition is very useful for studying a variety of 
markets, including agriculture, fuels and other commodities, housing, services, and financial markets. Because this model is so important, we will spend some time laying out the basic assumptions that underlie it.
The model of perfect competition rests on three basic assumptions: (1) price 
taking, (2) product homogeneity, and (3) free entry and exit. You have encoun-tered these assumptions earlier in the book; here we summarize and elaborate on them.
PRICE TAKING  Because many firms compete in the market, each firm faces a 
significant number of direct competitors for its products. Because each individual 
firm sells a sufficiently small proportion of total market output, its decisions have no impact on market price.  Thus, each firm takes the market price as given.  In short, 
firms in perfectly competitive markets are price takers.
Suppose, for example, that you are the owner of a small electric lightbulb dis-
tribution business. You buy your lightbulbs from the manufacturer and resell them at wholesale to small businesses and retail outlets. Unfortunately, you are only one of many competing distributors. As a result, you find that there is little room to negotiate with your customers. If you do not offer a competitive price—one that is determined in the marketplace—your customers will take their business elsewhere. In addition, you know that the number of lightbulbs that you sell will have little or no effect on the wholesale price of bulbs. You are a price taker.
The assumption of price taking applies to consumers  as well as firms. In a per-
fectly competitive market, each consumer buys such a small proportion of total industry output that he or she has no impact on the market price, and therefore takes the price as given.
Another way of stating the price-taking assumption is that there are many 
independent firms and independent consumers in the market, all of whom believe—correctly—that their decisions will not affect prices.
PRODUCT HOMOGENEITY  Price-taking behavior typically occurs in markets 
where firms produce identical, or nearly identical, products. When the products 
of all of the firms in a market are perfectly substitutable with one another —that is, 
when they are homogeneous —no firm can raise the price of its product above the 
price of other firms without losing most or all of its business. Most agricultural products are homogeneous: Because product quality is relatively similar among farms in a given region, for example, buyers of corn do not ask which individual farm grew the product. Oil, gasoline, and raw materials such as copper, iron, lumber, cotton, and sheet steel are also fairly homogeneous. Economists refer to such homogeneous products as commodities.
In contrast, when products are heterogeneous, each firm has the opportu-
nity to raise its price above that of its competitors without losing all of its sales. Premium ice creams such as Häagen-Dazs, for example, can be sold at higher prices because Häagen-Dazs has different ingredients and is perceived by many consumers to be a higher-quality product.
The assumption of product homogeneity is important because it ensures that 
there is a single market price , consistent with supply–demand analysis.
FREE ENTRY AND EXIT  This third assumption, free entry (or exit),  means 
that there are no special costs that make it difficult for a new firm either to enter • price taker  Firm that has no 
influence over market price and thus takes the price as given.
• free entry (or exit)   
Condition under which there are no special costs that make it difficult for a firm to enter (or exit) an industry.CHAPTER 8   •  Profit Maximization and Competitive Supply   281
an industry and produce, or to exit if it cannot make a profit. As a result, buyers 
can easily switch from one supplier to another, and suppliers can easily enter or exit a market.
The special costs that could restrict entry are costs which an entrant to a mar-
ket would have to bear, but which a firm that is already producing would not. The pharmaceutical industry, for example, is not perfectly competitive because Merck, Pfizer, and other firms hold patents that give them unique rights to pro-duce drugs. Any new entrant would either have to invest in research and devel-opment to obtain its own competing drugs or pay substantial license fees to one or more firms already in the market. R&D expenditures or license fees could limit a firm’s ability to enter the market. Likewise, the aircraft industry is not perfectly competitive because entry requires an immense investment in plant and equipment that has little or no resale value.
The assumption of free entry and exit is important for competition to be 
effective. It means that consumers can easily switch to a rival firm if a current supplier raises its price. For businesses, it means that a firm can freely enter an industry if it sees a profit opportunity and exit if it is losing money. Thus a firm can hire labor and purchase capital and raw materials as needed, and it can release or move these factors of production if it wants to shut down or relocate.
If these three assumptions of perfect competition hold, market demand and 
supply curves can be used to analyze the behavior of market prices. In most markets, of course, these assumptions are unlikely to hold exactly. This does not mean, however, that the model of perfect competition is not useful. Some mar-kets do indeed come close to satisfying our assumptions. But even when one or more of these three assumptions fails to hold, so that a market is not perfectly competitive, much can be learned by making comparisons with the perfectly competitive ideal.
When Is a Market Highly Competitive?
Apart from agriculture, few real-world markets are perfectly  competitive in the 
sense that each firm faces a perfectly horizontal demand curve for a homoge-neous product in an industry that it can freely enter or exit. Nevertheless, many markets are highly  competitive in the sense that firms face highly elastic demand 
curves and relatively easy entry and exit.
A simple rule of thumb to describe whether a market is close to being per-
fectly competitive would be appealing. Unfortunately, we have no such rule, and it is important to understand why. Consider the most obvious candidate: an industry with many firms (say, at least 10 to 20). Because firms can implic-itly or explicitly collude in setting prices, the presence of many firms is not sufficient for an industry to approximate perfect competition. Conversely, the presence of only a few firms in a market does not rule out competitive behav-ior. Suppose that only three firms are in the market but that market demand for the product is very elastic. In this case, the demand curve facing each firm is likely to be nearly horizontal and the firms will behave as if they were oper-
ating in a perfectly competitive market. Even if market demand is not very elastic, these three firms might compete very aggressively (as we will see in Chapter 13). The important point to remember is that although firms may behave competitively in many situations, there is no simple indicator to tell us when a market is highly competitive. Often it is necessary to analyze both the firms themselves and their strategic interactions, as we do in Chapters 12 and 13.In §2.4, we explain that 
demand is price elastic when the percentage decline in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage increase in price.282  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
8.2  Profit Maximization
We now turn to the analysis of profit maximization. In this section, we ask 
whether firms do indeed seek to maximize profit. Then in Section 8.3, we will describe a rule that any firm—whether in a competitive market or not—can use to find its profit-maximizing output level. Finally, we will consider the special case of a firm in a competitive market. We distinguish the demand curve facing a competitive firm from the market demand curve, and use this information to describe the competitive firm’s profit-maximization rule.
Do Firms Maximize Profit?
The assumption of profit maximization  is frequently used in microeconomics 
because it predicts business behavior reasonably accurately and avoids unnec-essary analytical complications. But the question of whether firms actually do seek to maximize profit has been controversial.
For smaller firms managed by their owners, profit is likely to dominate 
almost all decisions. In larger firms, however, managers who make day-to-day decisions usually have little contact with the owners (i.e., the stockholders). As a result, owners cannot monitor the managers’ behavior on a regular basis. Managers then have some leeway in how they run the firm and can deviate from profit-maximizing behavior.
Managers may be more concerned with such goals as revenue maximiza-
tion, revenue growth, or the payment of dividends to satisfy shareholders. They might also be overly concerned with the firm’s short-run profit (perhaps to earn a promotion or a large bonus) at the expense of its longer-run profit, even though long-run profit maximization better serves the interests of the stockholders.
1 
Because technical and marketing information is costly to obtain, managers may sometimes operate using rules of thumb that require less-than-ideal informa-tion. On some occasions they may engage in acquisition and/or growth strate-gies that are substantially more risky than the owners of the firm might wish.
The recent rise in the number of corporate bankruptcies, especially those in 
the financial sector, along with the rapid increase in CEO salaries, has raised questions about the motivations of managers of large corporations. These are important questions, which we will address in Chapter 17, when we discuss the incentives of managers and owners in detail. For now, it is important to realize that a manager’s freedom to pursue goals other than long-run profit maximiza-tion is limited. If they do pursue such goals, shareholders or boards of directors can replace them, or the firm can be taken over by new management. In any case, firms that do not come close to maximizing profit are not likely to survive. Firms that do survive in competitive industries make long-run profit maximiza-tion one of their highest priorities.
Thus our working assumption of profit maximization is reasonable. Firms 
that have been in business for a long time are likely to care a lot about profit, whatever else their managers may appear to be doing. For example, a firm that subsidizes public television may seem public-spirited and altruistic. Yet this beneficence is likely to be in the long-run financial interest of the firm because it generates goodwill.
1To be more exact, maximizing the market value of the firm  is a more appropriate goal than profit maxi-
mization because market value includes the stream of profits that the firm earns over time. It is the stream of current and future profits that is of direct interest to the stockholders.CHAPTER 8   •  Profit Maximization and Competitive Supply   283
Alternative Forms of Organization
Now that we’ve underscored the fact that profit maximization is a fundamental 
assumption in most economic analyses of firm behavior, let’s pause to consider an important qualifier to this assumption: Some forms of organizations have objectives that are quite different from profit maximization. An important such organization is the cooperative —an association of businesses or people jointly 
owned and operated by members for mutual benefit. For example, several farms might decide to enter into a cooperative agreement by which they pool their resources in order to distribute and market milk to consumers. Because each par-ticipating member of the milk cooperative is an autonomous economic unit, each farm will act to maximize its own profits (rather than the profits of the coopera-tive as a whole), taking the common marketing and distribution agreement as given. Such cooperative agreements are common in agricultural markets.
In many towns or cities, one can join a food cooperative, the objective of 
which is to provide its members with food and other groceries at the lowest possible cost. Usually, a food cooperative looks like a store or small supermar-ket. Shopping is either restricted to members or else unrestricted with members receiving discounts. Prices are set so that the cooperative avoids losing money, but any profits are incidental and are returned to the members (usually in pro-portion to their purchases).
Housing cooperatives, or co-ops , are another example of this form of organi-
zation. A co-op might be an apartment building for which the title to the land and the building is owned by a corporation. The member residents of the co-op own shares in the corporation, accompanied by a right to occupy a unit—an arrangement much like a long-term lease. The members of the co-op can partici-pate in the management of their building in a variety of ways: organizing social events, handling finances, or even deciding who their neighbors will be. As with other types of cooperatives, the objective is not to maximize profits, but rather to provide members with high-quality housing at the lowest possible cost.
A related type of organization, especially relevant for housing, is the condo-
minium.  A condominium (or “condo”) is a housing unit (an apartment, con-
nected town house, or other form of real estate) that is individually owned, while use of and access to common facilities such as hallways, heating system, elevators, and exterior areas are controlled jointly by an association of condo owners. Those owners also share in the payment for the maintenance and oper-ation of those common facilities. Compared to a cooperative, the condominium has the important advantage of simplifying governance, as we discuss below in Example 8.1.• cooperative  Association 
of businesses or people jointly owned and operated by members for mutual benefit.
• condominium  A housing 
unit that is individually owned but provides access to common facilities that are paid for and controlled jointly by an association of owners.
EXAMPLE 8.1  CONDOMINIUMS VERSUS COOPERATIVES IN NEW YORK CITY
While owners of condominiums must join with fel-
low condo owners to manage common spaces (e.g., entry areas), they can make their own deci-sions as to how to manage their individual units so as to achieve the greatest value possible. In con-trast, co-ops share joint liability on any outstanding mortgage on the co-op building and are subject to more complex governance rules. Although much of the governance is usually delegated to a board 
that represents all co-op members, members must often spend substantial time in the governance of the association. In addition, condo members can sell their units whenever and to whomever they choose, whereas co-op members must get per-mission from the co-op board before a sale can be made.284  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
8.3   Marginal Revenue, Marginal Cost, 
and Profit Maximization
We now return to our working assumption of profit maximization and exam-
ine the implications of this objective for the operation of a firm. We will begin by looking at the profit-maximizing output decision for any firm, whether it 
operates in a perfectly competitive market or is one that can influence price. Because profit  is the difference between (total) revenue and (total) cost, finding 
the firm’s profit-maximizing output level means analyzing its revenue. Suppose that the firm’s output is q, and that it obtains revenue R. This revenue is equal 
to the price of the product P times the number of units sold: R=Pq. The cost 
of production C also depends on the level of output. The firm’s profit, p, is the 
difference between revenue and cost:
p(q)=R(q)-C(q)
(Here we show explicitly that p, R, and C depend on output. Usually we will 
omit this reminder.)
To maximize profit, the firm selects the output for which the differ-
ence between revenue and cost is the greatest. This principle is illustrated in Figure 8.1. Revenue R(q) is a curved line, which reflects the fact that the firm 
can sell a greater level of output only by lowering its price. The slope of this revenue curve is marginal revenue:  the change in revenue resulting from a one-
unit increase in output.
Also shown is the total cost curve C(q).  The slope of this curve, which mea-
sures the additional cost of producing one additional unit of output, is the firm’s marginal cost.  Note that total cost C(q) is positive when output is zero because 
there is a fixed cost in the short run.• profit  Difference between 
total revenue and total cost.
• marginal revenue  Change 
in revenue resulting from a one-unit increase in output.Nationwide, condos are far more common than 
co-ops, outnumbering them by a factor of nearly 10 to 1. In this regard, New York City is very different from the rest of the nation—co-ops are more popu-lar, and outnumber condos by a factor of about 4 to 1. What accounts for the relative popularity of hous-ing cooperatives in New York City? Part of the answer is historical. Housing cooperatives are a much older form of organization in the U.S., dating back to the mid-nineteenth century, whereas the development of condominiums began only in the 1960s, at which point a large number of buildings in New York were already co-ops. In addition, while condominiums were becoming increasingly popular in other parts of the country, building regulations in New York made the co-op the required governance structure.But that’s history. The building restrictions in New 
York have long disappeared, and yet the conver-sion of apartments from co-ops to condos has been relatively slow. Why? A recent study provides some interesting answers.
2 The authors find that the typi-
cal condominium apartment is worth about 15.5 percent more than an equivalent apartment held in the form of a co-op. Clearly, holding an apart-ment in the form of a co-op is not the best way to maximize the apartment’s value. On the other hand, co-op owners can be more selective in choosing their neighbors when sales are made—something that New Yorkers seem to care a great deal about. It appears that in New York, many owners have been willing to forgo substantial amounts of money in order to achieve non-monetary benefits.
2Michael H. Schill, Ioan Voicu, and Jonathan Miller, “The Condominium v. Cooperative Puzzle: An 
Empirical Analysis of Housing in New York City,” Journal of Legal Studies , Vol. 36 (2007); 275–324.CHAPTER 8   •  Profit Maximization and Competitive Supply   285
For the firm illustrated in Figure 8.1, profit is negative at low levels of out-
put because revenue is insufficient to cover fixed and variable costs. As output increases, revenue rises more rapidly than cost, so that profit eventually becomes positive. Profit continues to increase until output reaches the level q*. At this 
point, marginal revenue and marginal cost are equal, and the vertical distance between revenue and cost, AB, is greatest. q* is the profit-maximizing output 
level. Note that at output levels above q*, cost rises more rapidly than revenue—
i.e., marginal revenue is less than marginal cost. Thus, profit declines from its maximum when output increases above q*.
The rule that profit is maximized when marginal revenue is equal to marginal 
cost holds for all firms, whether competitive or not. This important rule can also be derived algebraically. Profit, p=R-C, is maximized at the point at which 
an additional increment to output leaves profit unchanged (i.e., /H9004p//H9004q=0):
/H9004p//H9004q=/H9004R//H9004q-/H9004C//H9004q=0
/H9004R//H9004q is marginal revenue MR and /H9004C//H9004q is marginal cost MC. Thus we con-
clude that profit is maximized when MR -MC=0, so that
MR( q)=MC( q)
Demand and Marginal Revenue for a Competitive Firm
Because each firm in a competitive industry sells only a small fraction of the 
entire industry output, how much output the firm decides to sell will have no effect 
on the market price of the product.  The market price is determined by the industry 
demand and supply curves. Therefore, the competitive firm is a price taker.  Recall 
that price taking is one of the fundamental assumptions of perfect competition. The price-taking firm knows that its production decision will have no effect on the price of the product. For example, when a farmer is deciding how many acres of wheat to plant in a given year, he can take the market price of wheat—say, $4 per bushel—as given. That price will not be affected by his acreage decision.Cost,

PROFIT MAXIMIZATION IN THE 
SHORT RUN
A firm chooses output q*, so that profit, the 
difference AB between revenue R and cost 
C, is maximized. At that output, marginal 
revenue (the slope of the revenue curve) is equal to marginal cost (the slope of the cost curve).286  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
Often we will want to distinguish between market demand curves and the 
demand curves faced by individual firms. In this chapter we will denote mar-
ket output and demand by capital letters ( Q and D) and the firm’s  output and 
demand by lowercase letters ( q and d).
Because it is a price taker, the demand curve d facing an individual competitive 
firm is given by a horizontal line.  In Figure 8.2(a), the farmer’s demand curve cor-
responds to a price of $4 per bushel of wheat. The horizontal axis measures the amount of wheat that the farmer can sell, and the vertical axis measures the price.
Compare the demand curve facing the firm (in this case, the farmer) in 
Figure 8.2(a) with the market demand curve D in Figure 8.2(b). The market 
demand curve shows how much wheat all consumers  will buy at each possible 
price. It is downward sloping because consumers buy more wheat at a lower price. The demand curve facing the firm, however, is horizontal because the firm’s sales will have no effect on price. Suppose the firm increased its sales from 100 to 200 bushels of wheat. This would have almost no effect on the mar-ket because industry output is 2,000 million bushels. Price is determined by the interaction of all firms and consumers in the market, not by the output decision of a single firm.
By the same token, when an individual firm faces a horizontal demand curve, 
it can sell an additional unit of output without lowering price. As a result, when it sells an additional unit, the firm’s total revenue  increases by an amount equal to 
the price: one bushel of wheat sold for $4 yields additional revenue of $4. Thus, marginal revenue is constant at $4. At the same time, average revenue  received by In §4.1, we explain how the 
demand curve relates the quantity of a good that a consumer will buy to the price of that good.

DEMAND CURVE FACED BY A COMPETITIVE FIRM
A competitive firm supplies only a small portion of the total output of all the firms in an industry. 
Therefore, the firm takes the market price of the product as given, choosing its output on the  assumption that the price will be unaffected by the output choice. In (a) the demand curve facing 
the firm is perfectly elastic, even though the market demand curve in (b) is downward sloping.CHAPTER 8   •  Profit Maximization and Competitive Supply   287
the firm is also $4 because every bushel of wheat produced will be sold at $4. 
Therefore:
The demand curve d facing an individual firm in a competitive market is 
both its average revenue curve and its marginal revenue curve. Along this demand curve, marginal revenue, average revenue, and price are all equal.
Profit Maximization by a Competitive Firm
Because the demand curve facing a competitive firm is horizontal, so that 
MR=P, the general rule for profit maximization that applies to any firm can 
be simplified. A perfectly competitive firm should choose its output so that  marginal cost equals price :
MC( q)=MR=P
Note that because competitive firms take price as fixed, this is a rule for setting 
output, not price.
The choice of the profit-maximizing output by a competitive firm is so impor-
tant that we will devote most of the rest of this chapter to analyzing it. We begin with the short-run output decision and then move to the long run.
8.4  Choosing Output in the Short Run
How much output should a firm produce over the short run, when its plant size is fixed? In this section we show how a firm can use information about revenue and cost to make a profit-maximizing output decision.
Short-Run Profit Maximization by a Competitive Firm
In the short run, a firm operates with a fixed amount of capital and must choose the levels of its variable inputs (labor and materials) to maximize profit. Figure 8.3 shows the firm’s short-run decision. The average and marginal revenue curves are drawn as a horizontal line at a price equal to $40. In this figure, we have drawn the average total cost curve ATC, the average variable cost curve AVC, and the marginal cost curve MC so that we can see the firm’s profit more easily.
Profit is maximized at point A, where output is q* /H11005 8 and the price is $40, 
because marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost at this point. To see that  
q* /H11005 8 is indeed the profit-maximizing output, note that at a lower output, say 
q
1 /H11005 7, marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost; profit could thus be 
increased by increasing output. The shaded area between q1 /H11005 7 and q* shows 
the lost profit associated with producing at q1. At a higher output, say q2, mar-
ginal cost is greater than marginal revenue; thus, reducing output saves a cost that exceeds the reduction in revenue. The shaded area between q* and q
2 /H11005 9 
shows the lost profit associated with producing at q2. When output is q* /H11005 8, 
profit is given by the area of rectangle ABCD.
The MR and MC curves cross at an output of q0 as well as q*. At q0, however, 
profit is clearly not maximized. An increase in output beyond q0 increases 
profit because marginal cost is well below marginal revenue. We can thus Marginal, average, and total 
cost are discussed in §7.1.288  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
state the condition for profit maximization as follows: Marginal revenue equals 
marginal cost at a point at which the marginal cost curve is rising.  This conclusion 
is very important because it applies to the output decisions of firms in mar-kets that may or may not be perfectly competitive. We can restate it as follows:
Output Rule: If a firm is producing any output, it should produce at the level 
at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost.
Figure 8.3 also shows the competitive firm’s short-run profit. The distance AB 
is the difference between price and average cost at the output level q*, which is 
the average profit per unit of output. Segment BC measures the total number of

A firm need not always earn a profit in the short run, as Figure 8.4 shows. 
The major difference from Figure 8.3 is a higher fixed cost of production. This higher fixed cost raises average total cost but does not change the average variable cost and marginal cost curves. At the profit-maximizing output q*, 50

A COMPETITIVE FIRM MAKING A POSITIVE PROFIT
In the short run, the competitive firm maximizes its profit by choosing an output q* at which its 
 marginal cost MC is equal to the price P (or marginal revenue MR) of its product. The profit of the 
firm is measured by the rectangle ABCD.  Any change in output, whether lower at q1 or higher at q2, 
will lead to lower profit.CHAPTER 8   •  Profit Maximization and Competitive Supply   289
the price P is less than average cost. Line segment AB, therefore, measures the 
average loss from production. Likewise, the rectangle ABCD  now measures the 
firm’s total loss.
When Should the Firm Shut Down?
Suppose a firm is losing money. Should it shut down and leave the industry? The answer depends in part on the firm’s expectations about its future busi-ness conditions. If it believes that conditions will improve and the business will be profitable in the future, it might make sense to operate at a loss in the short run. But let’s assume for the moment that the firm expects the price of its product to remain the same for the foreseeable future. What, then, should it do?
Note that the firm is losing money when its price is less than average total 
cost at the profit-maximizing output q*. In that case, if there is little chance that 
conditions will improve, it should shut down and leave the industry. This deci-sion is appropriate even if price is greater than average variable cost, as shown in Figure 8.4. If the firm continues to produce, the firm minimizes its losses at output q*, but it will still have losses rather than profits because price is less 
than average total cost. Note also that in Figure 8.4, because of the presence of fixed costs, average total cost exceeds average variable cost, and average total cost also exceeds price, so that the firm is indeed losing money. Recall that A

EXAMPLE 8.2  THE SHORT-RUN OUTPUT DECISION OF AN ALUMINUM 
SMELTING PLANT
How should the manager of an 
aluminum smelting plant deter-mine the plant’s profit-maximizing output? Recall from Example 7.3 (page 240) that the smelting plant’s short-run marginal cost of produc-tion depends on whether it is run-ning two or three shifts per day. As shown in Figure 8.5, marginal cost is $1140 per ton for output levels up to 600 tons per day and $1300 per ton for output levels between 600 and 900 tons per day.
Suppose that the price of alu-
minum is initially P
1 /H11005 $1250 per 
ton. In that case, the profit-maxi-mizing output is 600 tons; the firm can make a profit above its variable cost of $110 per ton by employing workers for two shifts a day. Running a third shift would 
involve overtime, and the price of the aluminum is insufficient to make the added production profitable. Suppose, however, that the price of aluminum were to increase to P
2 /H11005 $1360 per 
ton. This price is greater than the $1300 marginal cost of the third shift, making it profitable to increase output to 900 tons  
per day.
Finally, suppose the price drops 
to only $1100 per ton. In this case, the firm should stop producing, but it should probably stay in busi-ness. By taking this step, it could 
resume producing in the future should the price increase.
fixed costs do not change with the level of output, but they can be eliminated if the firm shuts down. (Examples of fixed costs  include the salaries of plant 
managers and security personnel, and the electricity to keep the lights and heat running.)
Will shutting down always be the sensible strategy? Not necessarily. The 
firm might operate at a loss in the short run  because it expects to become profit-
able again in the future, when the price of its product increases or the cost of  production falls. Operating at a loss might be painful, but it will keep open the prospect of better times in the future. Moreover, by staying in business, the firm retains the flexibility to change the amount of capital that it uses and thereby reduce its average total cost. This alternative seems particularly appealing if the price of the product is greater than the average variable cost of production, since operating at q* will allow the firm to cover a portion of its 
fixed costs.
Our example of a pizzeria in Chapter 7 (Example 7.2) provides a useful illus-
tration. Recall that pizzerias have high fixed costs (the rent that must be paid, the pizza ovens, and so on) and low variable costs (the ingredients and perhaps some employee wages). Suppose the price that the pizzeria is charging its cus-tomers is below the average total cost of production.Then the pizzeria is losing money by continuing to sell pizzas and it should shut down if it expects busi-ness conditions to remain unchanged in the future. But, should the owner sell the store and go out of business? Not necessarily; that decision depends on the owner’s expectation as to how the pizza business will fare in the future. Perhaps adding jalapeno peppers, raising the price, and advertising the new spicy pizzas will do the trick.
Remember from §7.1 that 
a fixed cost is an ongoing cost that does not change with the level of output but is eliminated if the firm shuts down.CHAPTER 8   •  Profit Maximization and Competitive Supply   291

THE SHORT-RUN OUTPUT OF AN ALUMINUM SMELTING PLANT
In the short run, the plant should produce 600 tons per day if price is above 
$1140 per ton but less than $1300 per ton. If price is greater than $1300 per ton, it should run an overtime shift and produce 900 tons per day. If price drops below $1140 per ton, the firm should stop producing, but it should probably stay in business because the price may rise in the future.
EXAMPLE 8.3  SOME COST CONSIDERATIONS FOR MANAGERS
The application of the rule that marginal revenue 
should equal marginal cost depends on a man-ager’s ability to estimate marginal cost.
3 To obtain 
useful measures of cost, managers should keep three guidelines in mind.
First, except under limited circumstances, aver-
age variable cost should not be used as a substitute for marginal cost.  When marginal and average vari-
able cost are nearly constant, there is little difference between them. However, if both marginal and aver-age cost are increasing sharply, the use of average variable cost can be misleading in deciding how much to produce. Suppose for example, that a company has the following cost information:

Reed Holden, The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing , 5th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2010), ch. 2.Current output 100 units per day, 80 of which are produced during the regular shift and 
20 of which are produced during overtime

8.5   The Competitive Firm’s Short-Run 
Supply Curve
A supply curve  for a firm tells us how much output it will produce at every pos-
sible price. We have seen that competitive firms will increase output to the point at which price is equal to marginal cost, but will shut down if price is below average variable cost. Therefore, the firm’s supply curve is the portion of the mar-
ginal cost curve for which marginal cost is greater than average variable cost.
Figure 8.6 illustrates the short-run supply curve. Note that for any P greater 
than minimum AVC, the profit-maximizing output can be read directly from the graph. At a price P
1, for example, the quantity supplied will be q1; and at P2, 
it will be q2. For P less than (or equal to) minimum AVC, the profit-maximizing 
output is equal to zero. In Figure 8.6 the entire  short-run supply curve consists of the crosshatched portion of the vertical axis plus the marginal cost curve above the point of minimum average variable cost.
Short-run supply curves for competitive firms slope upward for the same rea-
son that marginal cost increases—the presence of diminishing marginal returns to one or more factors of production. As a result, an increase in the market price will induce those firms already in the market to increase the quantities they produce. Let’s calculate average variable cost and marginal cost for the first 80 units of output and then see how both cost measures change when we include the additional 20 units produced with overtime labor. For the first 80 units, average variable cost is simply the labor cost ($2400 /H11005 $30 per unit /H11003 80 units) plus the materials 
cost ($640 /H11005 $8 per unit /H11003 80 units) divided by the 
80 units—($2400 /H11001 $640)/80 /H11005 $38 per unit. Because 
average variable cost is the same for each unit of out-put, marginal cost is also equal to $38 per unit.
When output increases to 100 units per day, both 
average variable cost and marginal cost change. The variable cost has now increased; it includes the additional materials cost of $160 (20 units /H11003 
$8 per unit) and the additional labor cost of $1000 (20 units /H11003 $50 per unit). Average variable cost is 
therefore the total labor cost plus the materials cost ($2400 /H11001 $1000 /H11001 $640 /H11001 $160) divided by the 
100 units of output, or $42 per unit.
What about marginal cost? While the materials cost 
per unit has remained unchanged at $8 per unit, the marginal cost of labor has now increased to $50 per unit, so that the marginal cost of each unit of overtime output is $58 per day. Because marginal cost is higher than average variable cost, a manager who relies on average variable cost will produce too much.
Second, a single item on a firm’s accounting led-
ger may have two components, only one of which involves marginal cost.  Suppose that a manager 
is trying to cut back production. She reduces the number of hours that some employees work and lays off others. But the salary of an employee who is laid off may not be an accurate measure of the marginal cost of production when cuts are made. Union contracts, for example, often require the firm to pay laid-off employees part of their salaries. In this case, the marginal cost of increasing produc-tion is not the same as the savings in marginal cost when production is decreased. The savings is the labor cost after the required layoff salary has been subtracted.
Third, all opportunity costs should be included in 
determining marginal cost.  Suppose a department 
store wants to sell children’s furniture. Instead of building a new selling area, the manager decides to use part of the third floor, which had been used for appliances, for the furniture. The marginal cost of this space is the $90 per square foot per day in profit that would have been earned had the store continued to sell appliances there. This opportunity cost measure may be much greater than what the store actually paid for that part of the building.
These three guidelines can help a manager to 
measure marginal cost correctly. Failure to do so can cause production to be too high or too low and thereby reduce profit.CHAPTER 8   •  Profit Maximization and Competitive Supply   293

THE RESPONSE OF A FIRM TO A CHANGE 
IN INPUT PRICE
When the marginal cost of production for a firm 
 increases (from MC1 to MC2), the level of output that 
maximizes profit falls (from q1 to q2).The higher price not only makes the additional production profitable, but also 
increases the firm’s total profit because it applies to all units that the firm produces.
The Firm’s Response to an Input Price Change
When the price of its product changes, the firm changes its output level to 
ensure that marginal cost of production remains equal to price. Often, however, the product price changes at the same time that the prices of inputs  change. In 
this section we show how the firm’s output decision changes in response to a change in the price of one of its inputs.
Figure 8.7 shows a firm’s marginal cost curve that is initially given by MC
1 when 
the firm faces a price of $5 for its product. The firm maximizes profit by producing In §6.2, we explain that 
diminishing marginal returns occurs when each additional increase in an input results in a smaller and smaller increase in output.294  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
EXAMPLE 8.4  THE SHORT-RUN PRODUCTION OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS
Suppose you are managing an 
oil refinery that converts crude oil into a particular mix of products, including gasoline, jet fuel, and residual fuel oil for home heat-ing. Although plenty of crude oil is available, the amount that you refine depends on the capac-ity of the refinery and the cost of 
 production. How much should you 
produce each day?

ery’s marginal cost of produc-tion is essential for this decision. Figure 8.8 shows the short-run marginal cost curve (SMC). 
an output of q1. Now suppose the price of one input increases. Because it now costs 
more to produce each unit of output, this increase causes the marginal cost curve to shift upward from MC
1 to MC2. The new profit-maximizing output is q2, at which 
P /H11005 MC2. Thus, the higher input price causes the firm to reduce its output.
If the firm had continued to produce q1, it would have incurred a loss on the 
last unit of production. In fact, all production beyond q2 would reduce profit. 
4This example is based on James M. Griffin, “The Process Analysis Alternative to Statistical Cost 
Functions: An Application to Petroleum Refining,” American Economic Review  62 (1972): 46–56. The 
numbers have been updated and applied to a particular refinery.FIGURE 8.8
THE SHORT-RUN PRODUCTION OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS
As the refinery shifts from one processing unit to another, the marginal cost of 
producing petroleum products from crude oil increases sharply at several levels of output. As a result, the output level can be insensitive to some changes in price but very sensitive to others.Cost

8.6  The Short-Run Market Supply Curve
The short-run market supply curve  shows the amount of output that the 
industry will produce in the short run for every possible price. The indus-try’s output is the sum of the quantities supplied by all of its individual firms. Therefore, the market supply curve can be obtained by adding the supply curves of each of these firms. Figure 8.9 shows how this is done when there are only three firms, all of which have different short-run pro-duction costs. Each firm’s marginal cost curve is drawn only for the portion that lies above its average variable cost curve. (We have shown only three firms to keep the graph simple, but the same analysis applies when there are many firms.)
At any price below P
1, the industry will produce no output because P1 is the 
minimum average variable cost of the lowest-cost firm. Between P1 and P2, only 
firm 3 will produce. The industry supply curve, therefore, will be identical to that portion of firm 3’s marginal cost curve MC
3. At price P2, the industry sup-
ply will be the sum of the quantity supplied by all three firms. Firm 1 supplies 2 units, firm 2 supplies 5 units, and firm 3 supplies 8 units. Industry supply is thus 15 units. At price P
3, firm 1 supplies 4 units, firm 2 supplies 7 units, and 
firm 3 supplies 10 units; the industry supplies 21 units. Note that the industry supply curve is upward sloping but has a kink at price P
2, the lowest price at 
which all three firms produce. With many firms in the market, however, the kink becomes unimportant. Thus we usually draw industry supply as a smooth, upward-sloping curve.Marginal cost increases with  output, but in a series 
of uneven  segments rather than as a smooth curve. 
The increase occurs in segments because the refin-ery uses different processing units to turn crude oil into finished products. When a particular process-ing unit reaches capacity, output can be increased only by substituting a more expensive process. For example, gasoline can be produced from light crude oils rather inexpensively in a processing unit called a “thermal cracker.” When this unit becomes full, additional gasoline can still be produced (from heavy as well as light crude oil), but only at a higher cost. In the case illustrated by Figure 8.8, the first capacity constraint comes into effect when produc-tion reaches about 9700 barrels a day. A second capacity constraint becomes important when pro-duction increases beyond 10,700 barrels a day.
Deciding how much output to produce now 
becomes relatively easy. Suppose that refined products can be sold for $73 per barrel. Because 
the marginal cost of production is close to $74 for the first unit of output, no crude oil should be run through the refinery when the price is $73. If, however, price is between $74 and $75, the refinery should produce 9700 barrels a day (filling the thermal cracker). Finally, if the price is above $75, the more expensive refining unit should be used and production expanded toward 10,700 barrels a day.
Because the cost function rises in steps, you 
know that your production decisions need not change much in response to small  changes in 
price. You will typically use sufficient crude oil to fill the appropriate processing unit until price increases (or decreases) substantially. In that case, you need simply calculate whether the increased price warrants using an additional, more expensive processing unit.296  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets

INDUSTRY SUPPLY IN THE SHORT RUN
The short-run industry supply curve is the summation of the supply curves of the individual firms. Because 
the third firm has a lower average variable cost curve than the first two firms, the market supply curve S 
begins at price P1 and follows the marginal cost curve of the third firm MC3 until price equals P2, when 
there is a kink. For P2 and all prices above it, the industry quantity supplied is the sum of the quantities 
supplied by each of the three firms.
Elasticity of Market Supply
Unfortunately, finding the industry supply curve is not always as simple as add-
ing up a set of individual supply curves. As price rises, all firms in the industry expand their output. This additional output increases the demand for inputs to production and may lead to higher input prices. As we saw in Figure 8.7, increasing input prices shifts a firm’s marginal cost curve upward. For example, an increased demand for beef could also increase demand for corn and soybeans (which are used to feed cattle) and thereby cause the prices of these crops to rise. In turn, higher input prices will cause firms’ marginal cost curves to shift upward. This increase lowers each firm’s output choice (for any given market price) and causes the industry supply curve to be less responsive to changes in output price than it would otherwise be.
The price elasticity of market supply measures the sensitivity of industry out-
put to market price. The elasticity of supply E
s is the percentage change in quan-
tity supplied Q in response to a 1-percent change in price P:
Es=(/H9004Q/Q)/(/H9004P/P)
Because marginal cost curves are upward sloping, the short-run elasticity of 
supply is always positive. When marginal cost increases rapidly in response to increases in output, the elasticity of supply is low. In the short run, firms are capacity-constrained and find it costly to increase output. But when marginal In §2.4, we define the elas-
ticity of supply as the per-centage change in quantity supplied resulting from a 1-percent increase in price.CHAPTER 8   •  Profit Maximization and Competitive Supply   297

minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/copper/mcs-2011-coppe.pdf )EXAMPLE 8.5  THE SHORT-RUN WORLD SUPPLY OF COPPER
In the short run, the shape of the market supply 
curve for a mineral such as copper depends on how the cost of mining varies within and among the world’s major producers. Costs of mining, smelting, and refining copper differ because of differences in labor and transportation costs and because of differences in the copper content of the ore.  
Table 8.1 summarizes some of the relevant cost and production data for the nine largest copper- producing nations.
5 Remember that in the short 
run, because the costs of building mines, smelters, and refineries are taken as sunk, the marginal cost numbers in Table 8.1 reflect the costs of operating (but not building) these facilities.
These data can be used to plot the short-run 
world supply curve for copper. It is a short-run curve because it takes the existing mines and refineries as fixed. Figure 8.10 shows how the curve is con-
structed for the nine countries listed in the table. (The curve is incomplete because there are a few smaller and higher-cost producers that we have not included.) Note that the curve in Figure 8.10 is an approximation. The marginal cost number for each country is an average for all copper producers in that country, and we are assuming that marginal cost and average cost are approximately the same. In the United States, for example, some producers have a marginal cost greater than $1.70 and some less.
The lowest-cost copper is mined in Russia, where 
the marginal cost of refined copper is roughly $1.30 per pound. The line segment labeled MC
R 
 represents the marginal cost curve for Russia. The 
curve is horizontal until the total capacity for mining and refining copper in Russia is reached. (That point cost increases slowly in response to increases in output, supply is relatively elas-
tic; in this case, a small price increase induces firms to produce much more.
At one extreme is the case of perfectly inelastic supply , which arises when the indus-
try’s plant and equipment are so fully utilized that greater output can be achieved only if new plants are built (as they will be in the long run). At the other extreme is the case of perfectly elastic supply , which arises when marginal cost is constant.298  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
Producer Surplus in the Short Run
In Chapter 4, we measured consumer surplus  as the difference between the maxi-
mum that a person would pay for an item and its market price. An analogous concept applies to firms. If marginal cost is rising, the price of the product is greater than marginal cost for every unit produced except the last one. As a result, firms earn a surplus on all but the last unit of output. The producer sur-
plus  of a firm is the sum over all units produced of the differences between the 
market price of the good and the marginal cost of production. Just as consumer surplus measures the area below an individual’s demand curve and above the market price of the product, producer surplus measures the area above a pro-ducer’s supply curve and below the market price.For a review of consumer 
surplus, see §4.4, where it 
is defined as the difference between what a consumer is willing to pay for a good and what the consumer actually pays when buying it.

THE SHORT-RUN WORLD SUPPLY OF COPPER
The supply curve for world copper is obtained by summing the marginal cost curves for each

metric tons per year.) Line segment MCZ represents 
the marginal cost curve for Zambia, segment MCCh 
the marginal cost curve for Chile, and so on.
The world supply curve is obtained by summing 
each nation’s supply curve horizontally. As can be seen from the figure, the elasticity of supply depends on the price of copper. At relatively low prices, such as 
$1.30 and $1.80 per pound, the curve is quite elastic because small price increases lead to large increases in the quantity of copper supplied. At higher prices—say, above $2.40 per pound—the curve becomes more inelastic because, at those prices, most produc-ers would be operating close to or at capacity.CHAPTER 8   •  Profit Maximization and Competitive Supply   299
Figure 8.11 illustrates short-run producer surplus for a firm. The profit-maxi-
mizing output is q*, where P /H11005 MC. The surplus that the producer obtains from 
selling each unit is the difference between the price and the marginal cost of pro-ducing the unit. The producer surplus is then the sum of these “unit surpluses” over all units that the firm produces. It is given by the yellow area under the firm’s horizontal demand curve and above its marginal cost curve, from zero output to the profit-maximizing output q*.
When we add the marginal cost of producing each level of output from 0 to 
q*, we find that the sum is the total variable cost of producing q*. Marginal cost 
reflects increments to cost associated with increases in output; because fixed cost does not vary with output, the sum of all marginal costs must equal the sum of the firm’s variable costs.
6 Thus producer surplus can alternatively be defined 
as the difference between the firm’s revenue and its total variable cost.  In Figure 8.11, 
producer surplus is also given by the rectangle ABCD , which equals revenue 
(0ABq*) minus variable cost (0 DCq *).
PRODUCER SURPLUS VERSUS PROFIT  Producer surplus is closely related to 
profit but is not equal to it. In the short run, producer surplus is equal to revenue minus variable cost, which is variable profit.  Total profit, on the other hand, is 
equal to revenue minus all costs, both variable and fixed:
Producer surplus =PS=R-VC
Profit =p=R-VC-FC
It follows that in the short run, when fixed cost is positive, producer surplus is 
greater than profit.
The extent to which firms enjoy producer surplus depends on their costs of produc-
tion. Higher-cost firms have less producer surplus and lower-cost firms have more. By adding up the producer surpluses of all firms, we can determine the  producer

8.7  Choosing Output in the Long Run
In the short run, one or more of the firm’s inputs are fixed. Depending on the time 
available, this may limit the flexibility of the firm to adapt its production process to new technological developments, or to increase or decrease its scale of operation as economic conditions change. In contrast, in the long run, a firm can alter all its inputs, including plant size. It can decide to shut down (i.e., to exit the industry) or 
to begin producing a product for the first time (i.e., to enter  an industry). Because 
we are concerned here with competitive markets, we allow for free entry  and free 
exit. In other words, we are assuming that firms may enter or exit without legal 
restriction or any special costs associated with entry. (Recall from Section 8.1 that this is one of the key assumptions underlying perfect competition.) After analyzing the long-run output decision of a profit-maximizing firm in a competitive market, we discuss the nature of competitive equilibrium in the long run. We also discuss the relationship between entry and exit, and economic and accounting profits.
Long-Run Profit Maximization
Figure 8.13 shows how a competitive firm makes its long-run, profit-maximizing output decision. As in the short run, the firm faces a horizontal demand curve. (In Figure 8.13 the firm takes the market price of $40 as given.) Its short-run average (total) cost curve SAC and short-run marginal cost curve SMC are low enough for the firm to make a positive profit, given by rectangle ABCD , by producing an 
output of q
1, where SMC /H11005 P /H11005 MR. The long-run average cost curve LAC reflects 
the presence of economies of scale up to output level q2 and diseconomies of scale 
at higher output levels. The long-run marginal cost curve LMC cuts the long-run average cost from below at q
2, the point of minimum long-run average cost.In §7.4, we explain that 
economies of scale arise when a firm can double its output for less than twice the cost.CHAPTER 8   •  Profit Maximization and Competitive Supply   301

OUTPUT CHOICE IN THE 
LONG RUN
The firm maximizes its profit by 
choosing the output at which price equals long-run marginal cost LMC. In the diagram, the firm increases its profit from ABCD  to 
EFGD  by increasing its output in 
the long run.
If the firm believes that the market price will remain at $40, it will want 
to increase the size of its plant to produce at output q3, at which its long-run  
 marginal cost equals the $40 price. When this expansion is complete, the profit margin will increase from AB to EF, and total profit will increase from ABCD  to 
EFGD.  Output q
3 is profit-maximizing because at any lower output (say, q2), the 
marginal revenue from additional production is greater than the marginal cost. Expansion is, therefore, desirable. But at any output greater than q
3, marginal 
cost is greater than marginal revenue. Additional production would therefore reduce profit. In summary, the long-run output of a profit-maximizing competitive 
firm is the point at which long-run marginal cost equals the price.
Note that the higher the market price, the higher the profit that the firm can 
earn. Correspondingly, as the price of the product falls from $40 to $30, the profit also falls. At a price of $30, the firm’s profit-maximizing output is q
2, the point of 
long-run minimum average cost. In this case, because P /H11005 ATC, the firm earns 
zero economic profit.
Long-Run Competitive Equilibrium
For an equilibrium to arise in the long run, certain economic conditions must prevail. Firms in the market must have no desire to withdraw at the same time that no firms outside the market wish to enter. But what is the exact relationship between profitability, entry, and long-run competitive equilibrium? We can see the answer by relating economic profit to the incentive to enter and exit a market.
ACCOUNTING PROFIT AND ECONOMIC PROFIT  As we saw in Chapter 7, 
it is important to distinguish between accounting profit and economic profit. Accounting profit is measured by the difference between the firm’s revenues and its cash flows for labor, raw materials, and interest plus depreciation expenses. Economic profit takes into account opportunity costs. One such opportunity cost is the return to the firm’s owners if their capital were used elsewhere. Suppose, 302  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
for example, that the firm uses labor and capital inputs; its capital equipment 
has been purchased. Accounting profit will equal revenues R minus labor cost 
wL, which is positive. Economic profit p, however, equals revenues R minus 
labor cost wL minus the capital cost, rK:
p=R-wL-rK
As we explained in Chapter 7, the correct measure of capital cost is the user 
cost of capital, which is the annual return that the firm could earn by investing its money elsewhere instead of purchasing capital, plus the annual depreciation on the capital.
ZERO ECONOMIC PROFIT  When a firm goes into a business, it does so in 
the expectation that it will earn a return on its investment. A zero economic 
profit  means that the firm is earning a normal —i.e., competitive—return on that 
 investment. This normal return, which is part of the user cost of capital, is the firm’s opportunity cost of using its money to buy capital rather than investing it elsewhere. Thus, a firm earning zero economic profit is doing as well by investing its 
money in capital as it could by investing elsewhere —it is earning a competitive return 
on its money. Such a firm, therefore, is performing adequately and should stay in business. (A firm earning a negative  economic profit, however, should consider 
going out of business if it does not expect to improve its financial picture.)
As we will see, in competitive markets economic profit becomes zero in the 
long run. Zero economic profit signifies not that firms are performing poorly, but rather that the industry is competitive.
ENTRY AND EXIT  Figure 8.13 shows how a $40 price induces a firm to increase 
output and realize a positive profit. Because profit is calculated after subtracting the opportunity cost of capital, a positive profit means an unusually high return on a financial investment, which can be earned by entering a profitable industry. This high return causes investors to direct resources away from other industries and into this one—there will be entry  into the market. Eventually the increased 
production associated with new entry causes the market supply curve to shift to the right. As a result, market output increases and the market price of the prod-uct falls.
7 Figure 8.14 illustrates this. In part (b) of the figure, the supply curve 
has shifted from S1 to S2, causing the price to fall from P1 ($40) to P2 ($30). In part 
(a), which applies to a single firm, the long-run average cost curve is tangent to the horizontal price line at output q
2.
A similar story would apply to exit. Suppose that each firm’s minimum long-
run average cost remains $30 but the market price falls to $20. Recall our discus-sion earlier in the chapter; absent expectations of a price change, the firm will leave the industry when it cannot cover all of its costs, i.e., when price is less than average variable cost. But the story does not end here. The exit of some firms from the market will decrease production, which will cause the market supply curve to shift to the left. Market output will decrease and the price of the product will rise until an equilibrium is reached at a break-even price of $30. To summarize:
In a market with entry and exit, a firm enters when it can earn a positive long-
run profit and exits when it faces the prospect of a long-run loss.• zero economic profit  
A firm is earning a normal return on its investment—i.e., it is doing as well as it could by investing its money elsewhere.
7We discuss why the long-run supply curve might be upward sloping in the next section.CHAPTER 8   •  Profit Maximization and Competitive Supply   303
When a firm earns zero economic profit, it has no incentive to exit the indus-
try. Likewise, other firms have no special incentive to enter. A long-run com-
petitive equilibrium  occurs when three conditions hold:
 1. All firms in the industry are maximizing profit.
 2. No firm has an incentive either to enter or exit the industry because all 
firms are earning zero economic profit.
 3. The price of the product is such that the quantity supplied by the industry 
is equal to the quantity demanded by consumers.
The dynamic process that leads to long-run equilibrium may seem puzzling. 
Firms enter the market because they hope to earn a profit, and likewise they exit because of economic losses. In long-run equilibrium, however, firms earn zero economic profit. Why does a firm enter a market knowing that it will eventually earn zero profit? The answer is that zero economic profit represents a competitive return for the firm’s investment of financial capital. With zero economic profit, the firm has no incentive to go elsewhere because it cannot do better financially by doing so. If the firm happens to enter a market sufficiently early to enjoy an economic profit in the short run, so much the better. Similarly, if a firm exits an unprofitable market quickly, it can save its investors money. Thus the concept of long-run equilibrium tells us the direction that a firm’s  behavior is likely to take. • long-run competitive 
equilibrium  All firms in an 
industry are maximizing profit, no firm has an incentive to enter or exit, and price is such that quantity supplied equals quantity demanded.OutputDollars

LONG-RUN COMPETITIVE EQUILIBRIUM
Initially the long-run equilibrium price of a product is $40 per unit, shown in (b) as the intersection of demand 
curve D and supply curve S1. In (a) we see that firms earn positive profits because long-run average cost reaches 
a minimum of $30 (at q2). Positive profit encourages entry of new firms and causes a shift to the right in the sup-
ply curve to S2, as shown in (b). The long-run equilibrium occurs at a price of $30, as shown in (a), where each 
firm earns zero profit and there is no incentive to enter or exit the industry.304  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
The idea of an eventual zero-profit, long-run equilibrium should not discourage 
a manager—it should be seen in a positive light, because it reflects the opportu-nity to earn a competitive return.
FIRMS HAVING IDENTICAL COSTS  To see why all the conditions for long-run 
equilibrium must hold, assume that all firms have identical costs. Now consider what happens if too many firms enter the industry in response to an opportu-nity for profit. The industry supply curve in Figure 8.14(b) will shift further to the right, and price will fall below $30—say, to $25. At that price, however, firms will lose money. As a result, some firms will exit the industry. Firms will con-tinue to exit until the market supply curve shifts back to S
2. Only when there is 
no incentive to exit or enter can a market be in long-run equilibrium.
FIRMS HAVING DIFFERENT COSTS  Now suppose that all firms in the indus-
try do not have identical cost curves. Perhaps one firm has a patent that lets it produce at a lower average cost than all the others. In that case, it is consistent with long-run equilibrium for that firm to earn a greater accounting  profit and to 
enjoy a higher producer surplus than other firms. As long as other investors and firms cannot acquire the patent that lowers costs, they have no incentive to enter the industry. Conversely, as long as the process is particular to this product and this industry, the fortunate firm has no incentive to exit the industry.
The distinction between accounting profit and economic profit is important 
here. If the patent is profitable, other firms in the industry will pay to use it (or attempt to buy the entire firm to acquire it). The increased value of the patent thus represents an opportunity cost to the firm that holds it. It could sell the rights to the patent rather than use it. If all firms are equally efficient otherwise, the eco-
nomic  profit of the firm falls to zero. However, if the firm with the patent is more 
efficient than other firms, then it will be earning a positive profit. But if the patent holder is otherwise less efficient, it should sell off the patent and exit the industry.
THE OPPORTUNITY COST OF LAND  There are other instances in which 
firms earning positive accounting profit may be earning zero economic profit. Suppose, for example, that a clothing store happens to be located near a large shopping center. The additional flow of customers can substantially increase the store’s accounting profit because the cost of the land is based on its historical cost. However, as far as economic profit is concerned, the cost of the land should reflect its opportunity cost, which in this case is the current market value of the land. When the opportunity cost of land is included, the profitability of the clothing store is no higher than that of its competitors.
Thus the condition that economic profit be zero is essential for the market to 
be in long-run equilibrium. By definition, positive economic profit represents an opportunity for investors and an incentive to enter an industry. Positive accounting profit, however, may signal that firms already in the industry pos-sess valuable assets, skills, or ideas, which will not necessarily encourage entry.
Economic Rent
We have seen that some firms earn higher accounting profit than others because they have access to factors of production that are in limited supply; these might include land and natural resources, entrepreneurial skill, or other creative tal-ent. In these situations, what makes economic profit zero in the long run is the willingness of other firms to use the factors of production that are in limited supply. The positive accounting profits are therefore translated into economic CHAPTER 8   •  Profit Maximization and Competitive Supply   305
rent that is earned by the scarce factors. Economic rent  is what firms are willing 
to pay for an input less the minimum amount necessary to buy it. In competitive markets, in both the short and the long run, economic rent is often positive even though profit is zero.
For example, suppose that two firms in an industry own their land outright; 
thus the minimum cost of obtaining the land is zero. One firm, however, is located on a river and can ship its products for $10,000 a year less than the other firm, which is inland. In this case, the $10,000 higher profit of the first firm is due to the $10,000 per year economic rent associated with its river location. The rent is created because the land along the river is valuable and other firms would be willing to pay for it. Eventually, the competition for this specialized factor of production will increase the value of that factor to $10,000. Land rent—the dif-ference between $10,000 and the zero cost of obtaining the land—is also $10,000. Note that while the economic rent has increased, the economic profit of the firm on the river has become zero. Economic rent reflects the fact that there is an opportunity cost to owning the land and more generally to owning any factor of production whose supply is restricted. Here the opportunity cost of owning the land is $10,000, which is identified as the economic rent.
The presence of economic rent explains why there are some markets in which 
firms cannot enter in response to profit opportunities. In those markets, the sup-ply of one or more inputs is fixed, one or more firms earn economic rents, and all firms enjoy zero economic profit. Zero economic profit tells a firm that it should remain in a market only if it is at least as efficient in production as other firms. It also tells possible entrants to the market that entry will be profitable only if they can produce more efficiently than firms already in the market.
Producer Surplus in the Long Run
Suppose that a firm is earning a positive accounting profit but that there is no incentive for other firms to enter or exit the industry. This profit must reflect eco-nomic rent. How then does rent relate to producer surplus? To begin with, note that while economic rent applies to factor inputs, producer surplus applies to outputs. Note also that producer surplus measures the difference between the market price that a producer receives and the marginal cost of production. Thus, in the long run, in a competitive market, the producer surplus that a firm earns on the 
output that it sells consists of the economic rent that it enjoys from all its scarce inputs.
8
Let’s say, for example, that a baseball team has a franchise allowing it to oper-
ate in a particular city. Suppose also that the only alternative location for the team is a city in which it will generate substantially lower revenues. The team will therefore earn an economic rent associated with its current location. This rent will reflect the difference between what the firm would be willing to pay for its current location and the amount needed to locate in the alternative city. The firm will also be earning a producer surplus associated with the sale of baseball tickets and other franchise items at its current location. This surplus will reflect all economic rents, including those rents associated with the firm’s other factor inputs (the stadium and the players).
Figure 8.15 shows that firms earning economic rent earn the same economic 
profit as firms that do not earn rent. Part (a) shows the economic profit of a base-ball team located in a moderate-sized city. The average price of a ticket is $7, and costs are such that the team earns zero economic profit. Part (b) shows the profit of a team that has the same cost curves even though it is located in a larger city. • economic rent  Amount that 
firms are willing to pay for an input less the minimum amount necessary to obtain it.
8In a noncompetitive market, producer surplus will reflect economic profit as well as economic rent.306  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
Because more people want to see baseball games, the latter team can sell tickets for 
$10 apiece and thereby earn an accounting profit of $2.80 above its average cost of $7.20 on each ticket. However, the rent associated with the more desirable location represents a cost to the firm—an opportunity cost—because it could sell its fran-chise to another team. As a result, the economic profit in the larger city is also zero.
8.8   The Industry’s Long-Run 
Supply Curve
In our analysis of short-run supply, we first derived the firm’s supply curve 
and then showed how the summation of individual firms’ supply curves gener-ated a market supply curve. We cannot, however, analyze long-run supply in the same way: In the long run, firms enter and exit markets as the market price changes. This makes it impossible to sum up supply curves—we do not know which firms’ supplies to add up in order to get market totals.
The shape of the long-run supply curve depends on the extent to which 
increases and decreases in industry output affect the prices that firms must pay for inputs into the production process. In cases in which there are  economies of scale in production or cost savings associated with the purchase of large vol-umes of inputs, input prices will decline as output increases. In cases where diseconomies of scale are present, input prices may increase with output. The third possibility is that input costs may not change with output. In any of these Ticket

FIRMS EARN ZERO PROFIT IN LONG-RUN EQUILIBRIUM
In long-run equilibrium, all firms earn zero economic profit. In (a), a baseball team in a moderate-sized city 
sells enough tickets so that price ($7) is equal to marginal and average cost. In (b), the demand is greater, 
so a $10 price can be charged. The team increases sales to the point at which the average cost of produc-tion plus the average economic rent is equal to the ticket price. When the opportunity cost associated with owning the franchise is taken into account, the team earns zero economic profit.CHAPTER 8   •  Profit Maximization and Competitive Supply   307
cases, to determine long-run supply, we assume that all firms have access to 
the available production technology. Output is increased by using more inputs, not by invention. We also assume that the conditions underlying the market for inputs to production do not change when the industry expands or contracts. For example, an increased demand for labor does not increase a union’s ability to negotiate a better wage contract for its workers.
In our analysis of long-run supply, it will be useful to distinguish among 
three types of industries: constant cost, increasing cost , and decreasing cost.
Constant-Cost Industry
Figure 8.16 shows the derivation of the long-run supply curve for a constant-
cost industry.  A firm’s output choice is given in (a), while industry output is 
shown in (b). Assume that the industry is initially in equilibrium at the intersec-tion of market demand curve D
1 and short-run market supply curve S1. Point 
A at the intersection of demand and supply is on the long-run supply curve SL 
because it tells us that the industry will produce Q1 units of output when the 
long-run equilibrium price is P1.
To obtain other points on the long-run supply curve, suppose the market 
demand for the product unexpectedly increases (say, because of a reduction in personal income taxes). A typical firm is initially producing at an output of q
1, 
where P1 is equal to long-run marginal cost and long-run average cost. But because 
the firm is also in short-run equilibrium, price also equals short-run marginal cost. • constant-cost industry

LONG-RUN SUPPLY IN A CONSTANT-COST INDUSTRY
In (b), the long-run supply curve in a constant-cost industry is a horizontal line SL. When demand increases, initially 
causing a price rise (represented by a move from point A to point C), the firm initially increases its output from 
q1 to q2, as shown in (a). But the entry of new firms causes a shift to the right in industry supply. Because input 
prices are unaffected by the increased output of the industry, entry occurs until the original price is obtained  
(at point B in (b)).308  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
Suppose that the tax cut shifts the market demand curve from D1 to D2. Demand 
curve D2 intersects supply curve S1 at C. As a result, price increases from P1 to P2.
Part (a) of Figure 8.16 shows how this price increase affects a typical firm 
in the industry. When the price increases to P2, the firm follows its short-run 
marginal cost curve and increases output to q2. This output choice maximizes 
profit because it satisfies the condition that price equal short-run marginal cost. If every firm responds this way, each will be earning a positive profit in short-run equilibrium. This profit will be attractive to investors and will cause exist-ing firms to expand operations and new firms to enter the market.
As a result, in Figure 8.16 (b) the short-run supply curve shifts to the right 
from S
1 to S2. This shift causes the market to move to a new long-run equilib-
rium at the intersection of D2 and S2. For this intersection to be a long-run equi-
librium, output must expand enough so that firms are earning zero profit and the incentive to enter or exit the industry disappears.
In a constant-cost industry, the additional inputs necessary to produce higher 
output can be purchased without an increase in per-unit price. This might happen, for example, if unskilled labor is a major input in production, and the market wage of unskilled labor is unaffected by the increase in the demand for labor. Because the prices of inputs have not changed, firms’ cost curves are also unchanged; the new equilibrium must be at a point such as B in Figure 8.16 (b), at which price is 
equal to P
1, the original price before the unexpected increase in demand occurred.
The long-run supply curve for a constant-cost industry is, therefore, a horizontal line 
at a price that is equal to the long-run minimum average cost of production.  At any 
higher price, there would be positive profit, increased entry, increased short-run supply, and thus downward pressure on price. Remember that in a constant-cost industry, input prices do not change when conditions change in the output mar-ket. Constant-cost industries can have horizontal long-run average cost curves.
Increasing-Cost Industry
In an increasing-cost industry  the prices of some or all inputs to produc-
tion increase as the industry expands and the demand for the inputs grows. Diseconomies of scale in the production of one or more inputs may be the explanation. Suppose, for example, that the industry uses skilled labor, which becomes in short supply as the demand for it increases. Or, if a firm requires mineral resources that are available only on certain types of land, the cost of land as an input increases with output. Figure 8.17 shows the derivation of long-run supply, which is similar to the previous constant-cost derivation. The indus-try is initially in equilibrium at A in part (b). When the demand curve unexpect-
edly shifts from D
1 to D2, the price of the product increases in the short run to P2, 
and industry output increases from Q1 to Q2. A typical firm, as shown in part (a), 
increases its output from q1 to q2 in response to the higher price by moving along 
its short-run marginal cost curve. The higher profit earned by this and other firms induces new firms to enter the industry.
As new firms enter and output expands, increased demand for inputs 
causes some or all input prices to increase. The short-run market supply curve shifts to the right as before, though not as much, and the new equilibrium at B 
results in a price P
3 that is higher than the initial price P1. Because the higher 
input prices raise the firms’ short-run and long-run cost curves, the higher market price is needed to ensure that firms earn zero profit in long-run equi-librium. Figure 8.17 (a) illustrates this. The average cost curve shifts up from AC
1 to AC2, while the marginal cost curve shifts to the left, from MC1 to MC2. 
The new long-run equilibrium price P3 is equal to the new minimum average • increasing-cost 
industry  Industry whose 
long-run supply curve is upward sloping.CHAPTER 8   •  Profit Maximization and Competitive Supply   309
cost. As in the constant-cost case, the higher short-run profit caused by the 
initial increase in demand disappears in the long run as firms increase output and input costs rise.
The new equilibrium at B in Figure 8.17 (b) is, therefore, on the long-run sup-
ply curve for the industry. In an increasing-cost industry, the long-run industry 
supply curve is upward sloping.  The industry produces more output, but only at 
the higher price needed to compensate for the increase in input costs. The term “increasing cost” refers to the upward shift in the firms’ long-run average cost curves, not to the positive slope of the cost curve itself.
Decreasing-Cost Industry
The industry supply curve can also be downward sloping. In this case, the unexpected increase in demand causes industry output to expand as before. But as the industry grows larger, it can take advantage of its size to obtain some of its inputs more cheaply. For example, a larger industry may allow for an improved transportation system or for a better, less expensive financial net-work. In this case, firms’ average cost curves shift downward (even if they do not enjoy economies of scale), and the market price of the product falls. The lower market price and lower average cost of production induce a new long-run equilibrium with more firms, more output, and a lower price. Therefore, in a decreasing-cost industry,  the long-run supply curve for the industry is 
downward sloping.

LONG-RUN SUPPLY IN AN INCREASING-COST INDUSTRY
In (b), the long-run supply curve in an increasing-cost industry is an upward-sloping curve SL. When demand 
increases, initially causing a price rise, the firms increase their output from q1 to q2 in (a). In that case, the entry 
of new firms causes a shift to the right in supply from S1 to S2. Because input prices increase as a result, the new 
long-run equilibrium occurs at a higher price than the initial equilibrium.310  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
EXAMPLE 8.6  CONSTANT-, INCREASING-, AND DECREASING-COST 
INDUSTRIES: COFFEE, OIL, AND AUTOMOBILES
As you have progressed through this book, you have 
been introduced to industries that have constant, increasing, and decreasing long-run costs. Let’s look back at some of these industries, beginning with one that has constant long-run costs. In Example 2.7, we 
saw that the supply of coffee is extremely elastic in the long run (see Figure 2.18c). The reason is that land for growing coffee is widely available and the costs of planting and caring for trees remains con-stant as the volume of coffee produced grows. Thus, coffee is a constant-cost industry.
Now consider the case of an increasing-cost 
 industry. We explained in Example 2.9 that the oil 
industry is an increasing cost industry with an upward-sloping long-run supply curve (see Figure 2.23b). Why are costs increasing? Because there is a limited  availability of easily accessible, large-volume oil 
fields. Consequently, as oil companies increase out-put, they are forced to obtain oil from increasingly expensive fields.
Finally, a decreasing-cost industry. We discussed 
the demand for automobiles in Examples 3.1 and 3.3, but what about supply? In the automobile indus-try, certain cost advantages arise because inputs can be acquired more cheaply as the volume of produc-tion increases. Indeed, the major automobile manu-facturers—such as General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and Honda—acquire batteries, engines, brake sys-tems, and other key inputs from firms that specialize in producing those inputs efficiently. As a result, the average cost of automobile production decreases as the volume of production increases.
The Effects of a Tax
In Chapter 7, we saw that a tax on one of a firm’s inputs (in the form of an effluent fee) creates an incentive for the firm to change the way it uses inputs in its produc-tion process. Now we consider ways in which a firm responds to a tax on its output. To simplify the analysis, assume that the firm uses a fixed-proportions production technology. If it’s a polluter, the output tax might encourage the firm to reduce its output, and therefore its effluent, or it might be imposed merely to raise revenue.
First, suppose the output tax is imposed only on this firm and thus does not 
affect the market price of the product. We will see that the tax on output encour-ages the firm to reduce its output. Figure 8.18 shows the relevant short-run cost curves for a firm enjoying positive economic profit by producing an output of q
1 and selling its product at the market price P1. Because the tax is assessed for 
every unit of output, it raises the firm’s marginal cost curve from MC1 to MC2 /H11005 
MC1 /H11001 t, where t is the tax per unit of the firm’s output. The tax also raises the 
average variable cost curve by the amount t.
The output tax can have two possible effects. If the firm can still earn a positive 
or zero economic profit after the imposition of the tax, it will maximize its profit by  choosing an output level at which marginal cost plus the tax is equal to the price of the product. Its output falls from q
1 to q2, and the implicit  effect of the tax is to shift 
its supply curve upward (by the amount of the tax). If the firm can no longer earn an economic profit after the tax has been imposed, it will choose to exit the market.
Now suppose that every firm in the industry is taxed and so has increasing mar-
ginal costs. Because each firm reduces its output at the current market price, the total output supplied by the industry will also fall, causing the price of the product to increase. Figure 8.19 illustrates this. An upward shift in the supply curve, from S
1 to S2/H11005 S1 /H11001 t, causes the market price of the product to increase (by less than 
the amount of the tax) from P1 to P2. This increase in price diminishes some of the 
effects that we described previously. Firms will reduce their output less than they would without a price increase.CHAPTER 8   •  Profit Maximization and Competitive Supply   311
Finally, output taxes may also encourage some firms (those whose costs are 
somewhat higher than others) to exit the industry. In the process, the tax raises the long-run average cost curve for each firm.
Long-Run Elasticity of Supply
The long-run elasticity of industry supply is defined in the same way as the short-run elasticity: It is the percentage change in output ( /H9004Q/Q) that 
results from a percentage change in price ( /H9004P/P). In a constant-cost industry, 
the long-run supply curve is horizontal, and the long-run supply elasticity is infinitely large. (A small increase in price will induce an extremely large increase in  output.) In an increasing-cost industry, however, the long-run Dollars per

EFFECT OF AN OUTPUT TAX  
ON INDUSTRY OUTPUT
An output tax placed on all firms in a com-
petitive market shifts the supply curve for the industry upward by the amount of the tax. This shift raises the market price of the product and lowers the total output of the industry.312  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
EXAMPLE 8.7  THE SUPPLY OF TAXICABS IN NEW YORK
The price of a taxi ride depends, of course, on the 
distance. Most cities regulate the fares that a taxicab can charge, and typically the price of a ride begins with a fixed fee to enter the cab, and then a charge per mile driven. In 2011 there were 13,150 taxicabs operating in New York City. One would expect that if fares went down, fewer drivers would want to operate cabs and the quantity supplied would fall. Likewise, one would expect that if fares went up, more drivers would want to operate cabs and the quantity would increase. Let’s see if that’s right.
Driving a cab is not an easy job. Most drivers work 
a 12-hour shift six days per week. What annual income can the driver expect to earn? Assuming the driver works 50 weeks per year, the total hours worked will be 11221621502=3600 hours per year. But part of 
that time is spent waiting at a cab stand or cruising for passengers; only about 2/3 of the time will there actually be a paying passenger inside, i.e., about 2400 hours per year. Driving about 10 miles per hour (remember, this is New York), the cabbie will drive about 24,000 “paid” miles per year. Some rides are longer than others, but the average taxi ride in New York is about 5 miles, and (in 2011) the average cost was about $12.60 on the meter, or about $15 with tip. Based on 5-mile average trips, the driver will therefore make about 124,0002>152=4,800 trips and earn a 
gross income of 1$15214,8002=$72,000 per year.
From this, the driver must pay for gas, insurance, 
and maintenance and depreciation on the cab, which can add up to $10,000 per year. But that is not the only cost. As in most cities, driving a taxi in New York requires a medallion.  The medallions, which were 
issued by the city, are owned by taxicab compa-nies. The companies lease the medallions to drivers at a rate that is also regulated by the city: $110 per 
12-hour shift. Driving 6 shifts per week and 50 weeks per year, the cab driver must therefore pay an addi-tional 162150211102=$33,000 per year to lease 
the medallion. This leaves the driver with a net income of only $72,000 -$10,000 -$33,000 =$29,000 
per year.
Suppose New York City reduced the fare sched-
ule, so that a 5-mile trip only brought the driver $10 instead of $15. Then the driver’s annual gross revenue would drop from $72,000 to $48,000. After cover-ing the costs of leasing the medallion as well as gas, etc., the driver would be left with only $5,000 of net annual income. Under those circumstances, hardly anyone would want to drive a cab. And now sup-pose that New York instead raised taxi fares so that a 5-mile trip brought in $20 instead of $15. Now the driver’s annual gross revenue will be $96,000, and his net income after expenses would be $53,000. That’s not bad for a job that requires little education and no special skills, so many more people will want to drive cabs. Thus we would expect the supply curve for taxis to be very elastic—small reductions in the price (the fare earned on an average five-mile ride) will cause a sharp reduction in quantity, and small increases in price will cause a sharp increase in quan-tity (the number of operating taxicabs). This is illus-trated by the supply curve labeled S in Figure 8.20.
Something is missing, however. While reducing 
fares will indeed cause a reduction in the quantity supplied, raising the price will not cause an increase 
in the quantity supplied. Why not? Because the num-ber of medallions is fixed at 13,150, roughly the same number that were in circulation in 1937. By refusing to issue more medallions, New York effectively  limits 
9In some cases the opposite is true. Consider the elasticity of supply of scrap metal from a durable 
good like copper. Recall from Chapter 2 that because there is an existing stock of scrap, the long-run elasticity of supply will be smaller  than the short-run elasticity.supply elasticity will be positive but finite. Because industries can adjust and 
expand in the long run, we would generally expect long-run elasticities of supply to be larger than short-run elasticities.
9 The magnitude of the elas-
ticity will depend on the extent to which input costs increase as the market expands. For example, an industry that depends on inputs that are widely available will have a more elastic long-run supply than will an industry that uses inputs in short supply.CHAPTER 8   •  Profit Maximization and Competitive Supply   313
the supply of taxis to be no greater than 13,150. Thus 
the supply curve becomes vertical at the quantity 13,150 (and is labeled S’ in the figure).Many cities require taxis to have medallions and 
restrict the number of medallions. You’ll find out why in Chapter 9, when you read Example 9.5.Q 13,150$15SS′

FIGURE 8.20
THE SUPPLY CURVE FOR NEW 
YORK TAXICABS
If there were no restriction on the num-
ber of medallions, the supply curve would be highly elastic. Cab drivers work hard and don’t earn much, so a drop in the price P (of a 5-mile ride) 
would lead many of them to find an-other job. Likewise, an increase in price would bring many new drivers into the market. But the number of medallions—and therefore the num-ber of taxicabs—is limited to 13,150, so the supply curve becomes vertical at this quantity.
EXAMPLE 8.8  THE LONG-RUN SUPPLY OF HOUSING
Owner-occupied and rental 
housing provide interesting examples of the range of pos-sible supply elasticities. People buy or rent housing to obtain the services that a house pro-vides—a place to eat and sleep, comfort, and so on. If the price of housing services were to rise in one area of the country, the quantity of services provided could increase substantially.
To begin, consider the supply of owner-occu-
pied housing in suburban or rural areas where land is not scarce. In this case, the price of land does not increase substantially as the 
quantity of  housing supplied 
increases. Likewise, costs asso-ciated with construction are not likely to increase because there is a national market for lumber and other materials. Therefore, the long-run elasticity of the housing supply is likely to be very large, approximating that of a constant-cost industry. In fact, many studies find the long-
run supply curve to be nearly horizontal.

The market for rental housing is different, how-
ever. The construction of rental housing is often

 1. Managers can operate in accordance with a com-
plex set of objectives and under various constraints. However, we can assume that firms act as if they are maximizing long-run profit.
 2. Many markets may approximate perfect competition 
in that one or more firms act as if they face a nearly horizontal demand curve. In general, the number of firms in an industry is not always a good indicator of the extent to which that industry is competitive.
 3. Because a firm in a competitive market accounts for a 
small share of total industry output, it makes its out-put choice under the assumption that its production decision will have no effect on the price of the product. In this case, the demand curve and the marginal rev-enue curve are identical.
 4. In the short run, a competitive firm maximizes its 
profit by choosing an output at which price is equal to (short-run) marginal cost. Price must, however, be greater than or equal to the firm’s minimum average variable cost of production.
 5. The short-run market supply curve is the horizontal 
summation of the supply curves of the firms in an industry. It can be characterized by the elasticity of supply: the percentage change in quantity supplied in response to a percentage change in price.
 6. The producer surplus for a firm is the difference 
between its revenue and the minimum cost that would be necessary to produce the profit-maximizing out-
put. In both the short run and the long run, producer surplus is the area under the horizontal price line and above the marginal cost of production.
 7. Economic rent is the payment for a scarce factor of pro-
duction less the minimum amount necessary to hire that factor. In the long run in a competitive market, producer surplus is equal to the economic rent gener-ated by all scarce factors of production.
 8. In the long run, profit-maximizing competitive firms 
choose the output at which price is equal to long-run marginal cost.
 9. A long-run competitive equilibrium occurs under 
these conditions: (a) when firms maximize profit; (b) when all firms earn zero economic profit, so that there is no incentive to enter or exit the industry; and (c) when the quantity of the product demanded is equal to the quantity supplied.
 10. The long-run supply curve for a firm is horizontal 
when the industry is a constant-cost industry in which the increased demand for inputs to production (associ-ated with an increased demand for the product) has no effect on the market price of the inputs. But the long-
run supply curve for a firm is upward sloping in an 
increasing-cost industry, where the increased demand for inputs causes the market price of some or all inputs to rise.
QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW
 1. Why would a firm that incurs losses choose to produce 
rather than shut down?
 2. Explain why the industry supply curve is not the long-
run industry marginal cost curve.
 3. In long-run equilibrium, all firms in the industry earn 
zero economic profit. Why is this true?
 4. What is the difference between economic profit and 
producer surplus? 5. Why do firms enter an industry when they know that 
in the long run economic profit will be zero?
 6. At the beginning of the twentieth century, there were 
many small American automobile manufacturers. At the end of the century, there were only three large ones. Suppose that this situation is not the result of lax fed-eral enforcement of antimonopoly laws. How do you explain the decrease in the number of manufacturers? restricted by local zoning laws. Many communities 
outlaw it entirely, while others limit it to certain areas. Because urban land on which most rental housing is located is restricted and valuable, the long-run  elasticity of supply of rental housing is much lower 
than the elasticity of supply of owner-occupied hous-ing. As the price of rental-housing services rises, new high-rise rental units are built and older units are renovated—a practice that increases the quantity 
of rental services. With urban land becoming more valuable as housing density increases, and with the cost of construction soaring with the height of build-ings, increased demand causes the input costs of rental housing to rise. In this increasing-cost case, the elasticity of supply can be much less than 1; in one study, the authors found it to be 0.36.

In Chapter 2, we saw how supply and demand curves can help us 
describe and understand the behavior of competitive markets. In Chapters 3 to 8, we saw how these curves are derived and what 
determines their shapes. Building on this foundation, we return to sup-ply–demand analysis and show how it can be applied to a wide vari-ety of economic problems—problems that might concern a consumer faced with a purchasing decision, a firm faced with a long-range plan-ning problem, or a government agency that has to design a policy and evaluate its likely impact.
We begin by showing how consumer and producer surplus can be 
used to study the welfare effects  of a government policy—in other words, 
who gains and who loses from the policy, and by how much. We also use consumer and producer surplus to demonstrate the  efficiency  of 
a competitive market—why the equilibrium price and quantity in a competitive market maximizes the aggregate economic welfare of pro-ducers and consumers.
Then we apply supply–demand analysis to a variety of problems. 
Because very few markets in the United States have been untouched by government interventions of one kind or another, most of the prob-lems that we will study deal with the effects of such interventions. Our objective is not simply to solve these problems, but to show you how to use the tools of economic analysis to deal with them and others like them on your own. We hope that by working through the examples we provide, you will see how to calculate the response of markets to changing economic conditions or government policies and to evaluate the resulting gains and losses to consumers and producers.
9.1   Evaluating the Gains and Losses 
from Government Policies—Consumer and Producer Surplus
We saw at the end of Chapter 2 that a government-imposed price ceil-
ing causes the quantity of a good demanded to rise (at the lower price, consumers want to buy more) and the quantity supplied to fall (pro-ducers are not willing to supply as much at the lower price). The result 9.1

is a shortage—i.e., excess demand. Of course, those consumers who can still 
buy the good will be better off because they will now pay less. (Presumably, this was the objective of the policy in the first place.) But if we also take into account those who cannot obtain the good, how much better off are consumers as a whole?  Might they be worse off? And if we lump consumers and produc-
ers together, will their total welfare  be greater or lower, and by how much? To 
answer questions such as these, we need a way to measure the gains and losses from government interventions and the changes in market price and quantity that such interventions cause.
Our method is to calculate the changes in consumer and producer surplus  
that result from an intervention. In Chapter 4, we saw that consumer surplus  
 measures the aggregate net benefit that consumers obtain from a competitive market. In Chapter 8, we saw how producer surplus  measures the aggregate net 
benefit to producers. Here we will see how consumer and producer surplus can be applied in practice.
Review of Consumer and Producer Surplus
In an unregulated, competitive market, consumers and producers buy and sell at the prevailing market price. But remember, for some consumers the value of the good exceeds  this market price; they would pay more for the good if they had 
to. Consumer surplus  is the total benefit or value that consumers receive beyond 
what they pay for the good.
For example, suppose the market price is $5 per unit, as in Figure 9.1. Some 
consumers probably value this good very highly and would pay much more than $5 for it. Consumer A, for example, would pay up to $10 for the good. 
However, because the market price is only $5, he enjoys a net benefit of $5—the $10 value he places on the good, less the $5 he must pay to obtain it. Consumer B values the good somewhat less highly. She would be willing to pay $7, and In §2.7, we explain that 
under price controls, the price of a product can be no higher than a maximum allowable ceiling price.
For a review of consumer surplus, see §4.4, where it is defined as the difference between what a consumer is willing to pay for a good and what the consumer actually pays when buying it.

CONSUMER AND PRODUCER SURPLUS
Consumer A would pay $10 for a good whose mar-
ket price is $5 and therefore enjoys a benefit of $5. Consumer B enjoys a benefit of $2, and Consum-
er C, who values the good at exactly the market 
price, enjoys no benefit. Consumer surplus, which measures the total benefit to all consumers, is the yellow-shaded area between the demand curve and the market price. Producer surplus measures the total profits of producers, plus rents to factor inputs. It is the green-shaded area between the supply curve and the market price. Together, con-sumer and producer surplus measure the welfare benefit of a competitive market.CHAPTER 9   •  The Analysis of Competitive Markets  319
thus enjoys a $2 net benefit. Finally, Consumer C values the good at exactly the 
market price, $5. He is indifferent between buying or not buying the good, and if the market price were one cent higher, he would forgo the purchase. Consumer C, therefore, obtains no net benefit.
1
For consumers in the aggregate, consumer surplus is the area between the 
demand curve and the market price (i.e., the yellow-shaded area in Figure 9.1). Because consumer surplus measures the total net benefit to consumers , we can mea-
sure the gain or loss to consumers from a government intervention by measur-ing the resulting change in consumer surplus.
Producer surplus  is the analogous measure for producers. Some producers are 
producing units at a cost just equal to the market price. Other units, however, could be produced for less than the market price and would still be produced and sold even if the market price were lower. Producers, therefore, enjoy a ben-efit—a surplus—from selling those units. For each unit, this surplus is the dif-ference between the market price the producer receives and the marginal cost of producing this unit.
For the market as a whole, producer surplus is the area above the supply 
curve up to the market price; this is the benefit that lower-cost producers enjoy by 
selling at the market price.  In Figure 9.1, it is the green triangle. And because pro-
ducer surplus measures the total net benefit to producers, we can measure the gain or loss to producers from a government intervention by measuring the resulting change in producer surplus.
Application of Consumer and Producer Surplus
With consumer and producer surplus, we can evaluate the welfare effects  of a 
government intervention in the market. We can determine who gains and who loses from the intervention, and by how much. To see how this is done, let’s return to the example of price controls  that we first encountered toward the end 
of Chapter 2. The government makes it illegal for producers to charge more than a ceiling price  set below the market-clearing level. Recall that by decreasing pro-
duction and increasing the quantity demanded, such a price ceiling creates a shortage (excess demand).
Figure 9.2 replicates Figure 2.24 (page 58), except that it also shows the 
changes in consumer and producer surplus that result from the government price-control policy. Let’s go through these changes step by step.
 1. Change in Consumer Surplus:  Some consumers are worse off as a result 
of the policy, and others are better off. The ones who are worse off are those who have been rationed out of the market because of the reduction in production and sales from Q
0 to Q1. Other consumers, however, can still 
purchase the good (perhaps because they are in the right place at the right time or are willing to wait in line). These consumers are better off because they can buy the good at a lower price ( P
max rather than P0).
How much  better off or worse off is each group? The consumers who 
can still buy the good enjoy an increase  in consumer surplus, which is 
given by the blue-shaded rectangle A. This rectangle measures the reduc-
tion of price in each unit times the number of units consumers are able to buy at the lower price. On the other hand, those consumers who can no longer buy the good lose surplus; their loss is given by the green-shaded For a review of producer 
surplus, see §8.6, where it is defined as the sum over all units produced of the differ-ence between the market price of the good and the  marginal cost of its production.

and losses to consumers and producers.

demand curve to the right of the equilibrium quantity Q0 and will not purchase the good.320  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
triangle B. This triangle measures the value to consumers, less what they 
would have had to pay, that is lost because of the reduction in output from Q
0 to Q1. The net change in consumer surplus is therefore A − B. In 
Figure 9.2, because rectangle A is larger than triangle B, we know that the 
net change in consumer surplus is positive.
It is important to stress that we have assumed that those consumers 
who are able to buy the good are the ones who value it most highly. If that were not the case—e.g., if the output Q
1 were rationed randomly—
the amount of lost consumer surplus would be larger than triangle B. In 
many cases, there is no reason to expect that those consumers who value the good most highly will be the ones who are able to buy it. As a result, the loss of consumer surplus might greatly exceed triangle B, making price 
controls highly inefficient.
2
In addition, we have ignored the opportunity costs that arise with 
rationing. For example, those people who want the good might have to wait in line to obtain it. In that case, the opportunity cost of their time should be included as part of lost consumer surplus.
 2. Change in Producer Surplus:  With price controls, some producers (those 
with relatively lower costs) will stay in the market but will receive a lower price for their output, while other producers will leave the market. Both groups will lose producer surplus. Those who remain in the market and produce quantity Q
1 are now receiving a lower price. They have lost the 
producer surplus given by rectangle A. However, total production has also 
dropped. The purple-shaded triangle C measures the additional loss of 
producer surplus for those producers who have left the market and those

The price of a good has been regulated to be 
no higher than Pmax, which is below the market-
clearing price P0. The gain to consumers is the 
difference between rectangle A and triangle B. 
The loss to producers is the sum of rectangle A 
and triangle C. Triangles B and C together mea-

who have stayed in the market but are producing less. Therefore, the total 
change in producer surplus is − A − C. Producers clearly lose as a result of 
price controls.
 3. Deadweight Loss:  Is the loss to producers from price controls offset by 
the gain to consumers? No. As Figure 9.2 shows, price controls result in a net loss of total surplus, which we call a deadweight loss.  Recall that 
the change in consumer surplus is A − B and that the change in  producer 
surplus is − A − C. The total change in surplus is therefore ( A − B) /H11001 
(−A − C) 
/H11005 −B − C. We thus have a deadweight loss, which is given by the 
two triangles B and C in Figure 9.2. This deadweight loss is an inefficiency 
caused by price controls; the loss in producer surplus exceeds the gain in consumer surplus.
If politicians value consumer surplus more than producer surplus, this dead-
weight loss from price controls may not carry much political weight. However, if the demand curve is very inelastic, price controls can result in a net loss of 
consumer surplus , as Figure 9.3 shows. In that figure, triangle B, which measures 
the loss to consumers who have been rationed out of the market, is larger than rectangle A, which measures the gain to consumers able to buy the good. Here, 
because consumers value the good highly, those who are rationed out suffer a large loss.
The demand for gasoline is very inelastic in the short run (but much more 
elastic in the long run). During the summer of 1979, gasoline shortages resulted from oil price controls that prevented domestic gasoline prices from increas-ing to rising world levels. Consumers spent hours waiting in line to buy gaso-line. This was a good example of price controls making consumers—the group whom the policy was presumably intended to protect—worse off.• deadweight loss  Net loss of

EXAMPLE 9.1  PRICE CONTROLS AND NATURAL 
GAS SHORTAGES
In Example 2.10 (page 59), we discussed the price controls that were 
imposed on natural gas markets during the 1970s, and we analyzed what would happen if the government were once again to regulate the whole-sale price of natural gas. Specifically, we saw that, in 2007, the free-mar-ket wholesale price of natural gas was about $6.40 per thousand cubic feet (mcf), and we calculated the quantities that would be supplied and demanded if the price were regulated to be no higher than $3.00 per mcf. Now, equipped with the concepts of consumer surplus , producer 
surplus , and deadweight loss , we can calculate the welfare impact of this 
ceiling price.
Recall from Example 2.10 that we found that the supply and demand 
curves for natural gas could be approximated as follows:
 Supply :
 QS=15.90 +0.72PG+0.05PO
 Demand : QD=0.02 -1.8PG+0.69PO
where QS and QD are the quantities supplied and demanded, each measured 
in trillion cubic feet (Tcf), PG is the price of natural gas in dollars per thousand 
cubic feet ($/mcf), and PO is the price of oil in dollars per barrel ($/b). As 
you can verify by setting QS equal to QD and using a price of oil of $50 per 
 barrel, the equilibrium free market price and quantity are $6.40 per mcf and 
23 Tcf, respectively. Under the hypothetical regulations, however, the maxi-mum allowable price was $3.00 per mcf, which implies a supply of 20.6 Tcf and a demand of 29.1 Tcf.
Figure 9.4 shows these supply and demand curves and compares the free 
market and regulated prices. Rectangle A and triangles B and C measure the 
changes in consumer and producer surplus resulting from price controls. By calculating the areas of the rectangle and triangles, we can determine the gains and losses from controls.
To do the calculations, first note that 1 Tcf is equal to 1 billion mcf. 
(We must put the quantities and prices in common units.) Also, by sub-stituting the quantity 20.6 Tcf into the equation for the demand curve, we can determine that the vertical line at 20.6 Tcf intersects the demand curve at a price of $7.73 per mcf. Then we can calculate the areas as  
follows:
 A=(20.6
 billion mcf  )*($3.40/mcf) =$70.04  billion
 B=(1/2) *(2.4  billion mcf) *($1.33/mcf  )=$1.60  billion
 C=(1/2) *(2.4  billion mcf  )*($3.40/mcf  )=$4.08  billion
(The area of a triangle is one-half the product of its altitude and its base.)
The annual change in consumer surplus that would result from these 
hypothetical price controls would therefore be A-B=70.04 -1.60 =
$68.44  billion. The change in producer surplus would be -A-C =
-70.04 -4.08=-$74.12  billion. And finally, the annual deadweight loss CHAPTER 9   •  The Analysis of Competitive Markets  323
would be -B-C=-1.60 -4.08=-$5.68 billion. Note that most of 
this deadweight loss is from triangle C, i.e., the loss to those consumers who 
are unable to obtain natural gas as a result of the price controls.
FIGURE 9.4
EFFECTS OF NATURAL GAS PRICE CONTROLS
The market-clearing price of natural gas was $6.40 per mcf, and the (hypothetical) maximum 
allowable price is $3.00. A shortage of 29.1 -20.6=8.5 Tcf results. The gain to consumers 
is rectangle A minus triangle B, and the loss to producers is rectangle A plus triangle C. The 
deadweight loss is the sum of triangles B plus C.0

9.2  The Efficiency of a Competitive Market
To evaluate a market outcome, we often ask whether it achieves economic 
efficiency —the maximization of aggregate consumer and producer surplus. 
We just saw how price controls create a deadweight loss. The policy therefore imposes an efficiency cost  on the economy: Taken together, producer and con-
sumer surplus are reduced by the amount of the deadweight loss. (Of course, this does not mean that such a policy is bad; it may achieve other objectives that policymakers and the public deem important.)
MARKET FAILURE  One might think that if the only objective is to achieve 
 economic efficiency, a competitive market is better left alone. This is sometimes, • economic efficiency   
Maximization of aggregate consumer and producer surplus.324  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
but not always, the case. In some situations, a market failure  occurs: Because 
prices fail to provide the proper signals to consumers and producers, the  unregulated competitive market is inefficient—i.e., does not maximize aggre-gate consumer and producer surplus. There are two important instances in which market failure can occur:
 1. Externalities:  Sometimes the actions of either consumers or producers 
 result in costs or benefits that do not show up as part of the market price. Such costs or benefits are called externalities  because they are “external” 
to the market. One example is the cost to society of environmental pollu-tion by a producer of industrial chemicals. Without government interven-tion, such a producer will have no incentive to consider the social cost of pollution. We examine externalities and the proper government response to them in Chapter 18.
 2. Lack of Information:  Market failure can also occur when consumers lack 
information about the quality or nature of a product and so cannot make utility-maximizing purchasing decisions. Government intervention (e.g., requiring “truth in labeling”) may then be desirable. The role of informa-tion is discussed in detail in Chapter 17.
In the absence of externalities or a lack of information, an unregulated com-
petitive market does lead to the economically efficient output level. To see this, let’s consider what happens if price is constrained to be something other than the equilibrium market-clearing price.
We have already examined the effects of a price ceiling  (a price held below 
the market-clearing price). As you can see in Figure 9.2 (page 320), produc-
tion falls (from Q
0 to Q1), and there is a corresponding loss of total surplus (the 
deadweight-loss triangles B and C). Too little is produced, and consumers and 
producers in the aggregate are worse off. 
Now suppose instead that the government required the price to be above  
the market-clearing price—say, P2 instead of P0. As Figure 9.5 shows, although 
 producers would like to produce more at this higher price ( Q2 instead of Q0), 
consumers will now buy less ( Q3 instead of Q0). If we assume that producers 
produce only what can be sold, the market output level will be Q3, and again, 
there is a net loss of total surplus. In Figure 9.5, rectangle A now represents a • market failure  Situation

When price is regulated to be no lower than P2, only Q3 will be

triangles B and C. At price P2, producers would like to produce 
more than Q3. If they do, the deadweight loss will be even larger.CHAPTER 9   •  The Analysis of Competitive Markets  325

triangles B and C again represent a deadweight loss. Because of the higher price, 
some consumers are no longer buying the good (a loss of consumer surplus given by triangle B), and some producers are no longer producing it (a loss of 
producer surplus given by triangle C).
In fact, the deadweight loss triangles B and C in Figure 9.5 give an optimistic 
assessment of the efficiency cost of policies that force price above market-clearing  levels. Some producers, enticed by the high price P
2, might increase their capacity 
and output levels, which would result in unsold output. (This happened in the airline industry when, prior to 1980, fares were regulated above market-clearing levels by the Civil Aeronautics Board.) Or to satisfy producers, the government might buy up unsold output to maintain production at Q
2 or close to it. (This is 
what happens in U.S. agriculture.) In both cases, the total welfare loss will exceed the areas of triangles B and C.
We will examine minimum prices, price supports, and related policies in 
some detail in the next few sections. Besides showing how supply–demand analysis can be used to understand and assess these policies, we will see how deviations from the competitive market equilibrium lead to efficiency costs.
EXAMPLE 9.2  THE MARKET FOR HUMAN KIDNEYS
Should people have the right to sell parts of their bodies? Congress believes the answer is no. In 1984, it passed the National Organ Transplantation Act, which prohibits the sale of organs for transplanta-tion. Organs may only be donated.
Although the law prohibits their sale, it 
does not make organs valueless. Instead, it prevents those who supply organs (living persons or the families of the deceased) from reaping their economic value. It also creates a shortage of organs. Each year, about 16,000 kidneys, 44,000 corneas, and 2300 hearts are transplanted in the United 
States. But there is considerable excess demand for these organs, so that many potential recipients must do without them, some of whom die as a result. For example, as of July 2011, there were about 111,500 patients on the national Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) wait-ing list. However, only 28,662 transplant surgeries were performed in the United States in 2010. Although the number of transplant surgeries has nearly doubled since 1990, the number of patients waiting for organs has increased to nearly five times its level in 1990.
3
To understand the effects of this law, let’s consider the supply and 
demand for kidneys. First the supply curve. Even at a price of zero (the effective price under the law), donors supply about 16,000 kidneys per 
326  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
year. But many other people who need kidney transplants cannot obtain 
them because of a lack of donors. It has been estimated that 8000 more kidneys would be supplied if the price were $20,000. We can fit a linear supply curve to this data—i.e., a supply curve of the form Q=a+bP. 
When P=0, Q=16,000, so a=16,000. If 
P=$20,000,  Q=24,000, so 
b=(24,000 -16,000)/20,000 =0.4. Thus the supply curve is
Supply : QS=16,000 +0.4P
Note that at a price of $20,000, the elasticity of supply is 0.33.
It is expected that at a price of $20,000, the number of kidneys demanded 
would be 24,000 per year. Like supply, demand is relatively price inelastic; a reasonable estimate for the price elasticity of demand at the $20,000 price is −0.33. This implies the following linear demand curve:
Demand :
 QD=32,000 -0.4P
These supply and demand curves are plotted in Figure 9.6, which shows the 
market-clearing price and quantity of $20,000 and 24,000, respectively.In §2.6, we explain how to 
fit linear demand and sup-ply curves from information about the equilibrium price and quantity and the price elasticities of demand and supply.

THE MARKET FOR KIDNEYS AND THE EFFECT OF THE NATIONAL  
ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION ACT
The market-clearing price is $20,000; at this price, about 24,000 kidneys per year would be sup-
plied. The law effectively makes the price zero. About 16,000 kidneys per year are still  donated; 
this constrained supply is shown as S'. The loss to suppliers is given by rectangle A and  triangle 
C. If consumers received kidneys at no cost, their gain would be given by rectangle A less 
 triangle B. In practice, kidneys are often rationed on the basis of willingness to pay, and many 
recipients pay most or all of the $40,000 price that clears the market when supply is  constrained. 
Rectangles A and D measure the total value of kidneys when supply is constrained.CHAPTER 9   •  The Analysis of Competitive Markets  327

Barnett, and David L. Kaserman, “Markets for Organs: The Question of Supply,” Contemporary 
Economic Policy  17 (April 1999); 147–55. Kidney exchange is also complicated by the need to match 
blood type; for a recent analysis, see Alvin E. Roth, Tayfun Sönmez, and M. Utku Ünver, “Efficient Kidney Exchange: Coincidence of Wants in Markets with Compatibility-Based Preferences,” American Economic Review  97 (June 2007).
5For discussions of the strengths and weaknesses of these arguments, see Susan Rose-Ackerman, 
“Inalienability and the Theory of Property Rights,” Columbia Law Review  85 (June 1985): 931–69, and 
Roger D. Blair and David L. Kaserman, “The Economics and Ethics of Alternative Cadaveric Organ Procurement Policies,” Yale Journal on Regulation  8 (Summer 1991): 403–52.Because the sale of kidneys is prohibited, supply is limited to 16,000 (the 
number of kidneys that people donate). This constrained supply is shown as the vertical line S´. How does this affect the welfare of kidney suppliers and 
recipients?
First consider suppliers. Those who provide kidneys fail to receive the 
$20,000 that each kidney is worth—a loss of surplus represented by rectan-gle A and equal to (16,000)($20,000) /H11005 $320 million. Moreover, some peo-
ple who would supply kidneys if they were paid do not. These people lose an amount of surplus represented by triangle C, which is equal to (1/2)(8000)
($20,000) /H11005 $80 million. Therefore, the total loss to suppliers is $400 million.
What about recipients? Presumably the law intended to treat the kidney as 
a gift to the recipient. In this case, those recipients who obtain kidneys gain 
rectangle A ($320 million) because they (or their insurance companies) do not 
have to pay the $20,000 price. Those who cannot obtain kidneys lose surplus of an amount given by triangle B and equal to $80 million. This implies a net 
increase in the surplus of recipients of $320 million − $80 million /H11005 $240 million. 
It also implies a deadweight loss equal to the areas of triangles B and C 
(i.e., $160 million).
These estimates of the welfare effects of the policy may need adjustment 
for two reasons. First, kidneys will not necessarily be allocated to those who value them most highly. If the limited supply of kidneys is partly allocated to people with valuations below $40,000, the true deadweight loss will be higher than our estimate. Second, with excess demand, there is no way to ensure that recipients will receive their kidneys as gifts. In practice, kidneys are often rationed on the basis of willingness to pay, and many recipients end up  paying 
all or most of the $40,000 price that is needed to clear the market when  supply 
is constrained to 16,000. A good part of the value of the kidneys—rectangles A and D in the figure—is then captured by hospitals and middlemen. As a 
result, the law reduces the surplus of recipients as well as of suppliers.
4
There are, of course, arguments in favor of prohibiting the sale of organs.5 
One argument stems from the problem of imperfect information; if people receive payment for organs, they may hide adverse information about their health histories. This argument is probably most applicable to the sale of blood, where there is a possibility of transmitting hepatitis, AIDS, or other viruses. But even in such cases, screening (at a cost that would be included in the market price) may be more efficient than prohibiting sales. This issue has been central to the debate in the United States over blood policy.
A second argument holds that it is simply unfair to allocate a basic neces-
sity of life on the basis of ability to pay. This argument transcends economics. 328  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
However, two points should be kept in mind. First, when the price of a good 
that has a significant opportunity cost is forced to zero, there is bound to be reduced supply and excess demand. Second, it is not clear why live organs should be treated differently from close substitutes; artificial limbs, joints, and heart valves, for example, are sold even though real kidneys are not.
Many complex ethical and economic issues are involved in the sale of 
organs. These issues are important, and this example is not intended to sweep them away. Economics, the dismal science, simply shows us that human organs have economic value that cannot be ignored, and that prohibiting their sale imposes a cost on society that must be weighed against the benefits.

PRICE MINIMUM
Price is regulated to be no lower than Pmin. Produc-
ers would like to supply Q2, but consumers will 
buy only Q3. If producers indeed produce Q2, the 
amount Q2 − Q3 will go unsold and the change in 
producer surplus will be A − C − D. In this case, 
producers as a group may be worse off.9.3  Minimum Prices
As we have seen, government policy sometimes seeks to raise  prices above 
 market-clearing levels, rather than lower them. Examples include the former regulation of the airlines by the Civil Aeronautics Board, the minimum wage law, and a variety of agricultural policies. (Most import quotas and tariffs also have this intent, as we will see in Section 9.5.) One way to raise prices above market-clearing levels is by direct regulation—simply make it illegal to charge a price lower than a specific minimum level.
Look again at Figure 9.5 (page 324). If producers correctly anticipate that 
they can sell only the lower quantity Q
3, the net welfare loss will be given by 
triangles B and C. But as we explained, producers might not limit their output 
to Q3. What happens if producers think they can sell all they want at the higher 
price and produce accordingly? That situation is illustrated in Figure 9.7, where P
min denotes a minimum price set by the government. The quantity supplied is 
now Q2 and the quantity demanded is Q3, the difference representing excess, 
unsold supply. Now let’s determine the resulting changes in consumer and pro-ducer surplus.
Those consumers who still purchase the good must now pay a higher price 
and so suffer a loss of surplus, which is given by rectangle A in Figure 9.7. Some CHAPTER 9   •  The Analysis of Competitive Markets  329

THE MINIMUM WAGE
Although the market-clearing wage is w0, firms are not allowed 
to pay less than wmin. This results in unemployment of an amount

with a corresponding loss of surplus given by triangle B. The total change in 
consumer surplus is therefore
/H9004CS=-A-B
Consumers clearly are worse off as a result of this policy.
What about producers? They receive a higher price for the units they sell, 
which results in an increase of surplus, given by rectangle A. (Rectangle A 
represents a transfer of money from consumers to producers.) But the drop in sales from Q
0 to Q3 results in a loss of surplus, which is given by triangle C. 
Finally, consider the cost to producers of expanding production from Q0 to Q2. 
Because they sell only Q3, there is no revenue to cover the cost of producing 
Q2 − Q3. How can we measure this cost? Remember that the supply curve is 
the aggregate marginal cost curve for the industry. The supply curve therefore gives us the additional cost of producing each incremental unit. Thus the area under the supply curve from Q
3 to Q2 is the cost of producing the quantity Q2 
− Q3. This cost is represented by the shaded trapezoid D. So unless producers 
respond to unsold output by cutting production, the total change in producer surplus is
/H9004PS=A-C-D
Given that trapezoid D can be large, a minimum price can even result in a net 
loss of surplus to producers alone! As a result, this form of government inter-vention can reduce producers’ profits because of the cost of excess production.
Another example of a government-imposed price minimum is a minimum 
wage law. The effect of this policy is illustrated in Figure 9.8, which shows the supply and demand for labor. The wage is set at w
min, a level higher than the 
market-clearing wage w0. As a result, those workers who can find jobs obtain a 
higher wage. However, some people who want to work will be unable to. The policy results in unemployment, which in the figure is L
2 − L1. We will examine 
the minimum wage in more detail in Chapter 14.330  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets

Before 1980, the airline industry 
in the United States looked very 
different than it does today. Fares 
and routes were tightly regulated 
by the Civil Aeronautics Board 
(CAB). The CAB set most fares 
well above what would have pre-
vailed in a free market. It also 
restricted entry, so that many 
routes were served by only one or two airlines. By 
the late 1970s, however, the CAB liberalized fare 
regulation and allowed airlines to serve any routes 
they wished. By 1981, the industry had been com-
pletely deregulated, and the CAB itself was dis-
solved in 1982. Since that time, many new airlines 
have begun service, others have gone out of busi-
ness, and price competition has become much 
more intense.
Many airline executives feared that deregulation 
would lead to chaos in the industry, with  competitive 
pressure causing sharply reduced profits and even 
bankruptcies. After all, the original rationale for CAB regulation was to provide “stabil-
ity” in an industry that was con-
sidered vital to the U.S. economy. 
And one might think that as long 
as price was held above its mar-
ket-clearing level, profits would 
be higher than they would be in 
a free market.
Deregulation did lead to major 
changes in the industry. Some airlines merged or 
went out of business as new ones entered. Although 
prices fell considerably (to the benefit of consumers), 
profits overall did not fall much because the CAB’s 
minimum prices had caused inefficiencies and artifi-
cially high costs. The effect of minimum prices is illus-
trated in Figure 9.9, where P0 and Q0 are the market-
clearing price and quantity, Pmin is the minimum price, 
and Q1 is the amount demanded at this higher price. 
The problem was that at price Pmin, airlines wanted to 
supply a quantity Q2, much larger than Q1. Although 
they did not expand output to Q2, they did expand 
it well beyond Q1—to Q3 in the figure—hoping to

a result, load factors (the percentage of seats filled) were relatively low, and so were profits. (Trapezoid D 
measures the cost of unsold output.)
Table 9.1 gives some key numbers that illustrate 
the evolution of the airline industry.
6 The number 
of carriers increased dramatically after deregula-tion, as did passenger load factors (the percentage of seats with passengers). The passenger-mile rate (the revenue per passenger-mile flown) fell sharply in real (inflation-adjusted) terms from 1980 to 1990, and then continued to drop through 2010. This decline was the result of increased competition and reductions in fares, and made air travel affordable to many more consumers.
And what about costs? The real cost index indi-
cates that even after adjusting for inflation, costs increased by about 45 percent between 1975 and 1980, and then fell considerably over the next 20 years. Changes in cost, however, are driven to a great extent by changes in the cost of fuel, which is driven in turn by changes in the price of oil. (For most airlines, fuel accounts for close to 30 per-cent of total operating costs.) As Table 9.1 shows, the real cost of fuel has fluctuated dramatically, and this had nothing to do with deregulation. Because airlines have no control over oil prices, it 
is more informative to examine a “corrected” real cost index which removes the effects of changing fuel costs. Real fuel costs increased considerably from 1975 to 1980, which accounts for much of the increase in the real cost index. Real fuel costs nearly tripled from 2000 to 2010 (because of sharp increases in the price of oil); had fuel costs remained level, the real cost index would have declined  (from 85 to 76) rather than increasing 
sharply (from 89 to 148).
What, then, did airline deregulation do for con-
sumers and producers? As new airlines entered the industry and fares went down, consumers ben-efited. This fact is borne out by the increase in con-sumer surplus given by rectangle A and triangle 
B in Figure 9.9. (The actual benefit to consumers 
was somewhat smaller because quality  declined as 
planes became more crowded and delays and can-cellations multiplied.) As for the airlines, they had to learn to live in a more competitive—and therefore more turbulent—environment, and some firms did not survive. But overall, airlines became so much more efficient that producer surplus may have increased. The total welfare gain from deregulation was positive and quite large.

9.4  Price Supports and Production Quotas
Besides imposing a minimum price, the government can increase the price of a 
good in other ways. Much of American agricultural policy is based on a system of price supports,  whereby the government sets the market price of a good above the 
free-market level and buys up whatever output is needed to maintain that price. The government can also increase prices by restricting production , either directly or 
through incentives to producers. In this section, we show how these policies work and examine their impact on consumers, producers, and the federal budget.
Price Supports
In the United States, price supports aim to increase the prices of dairy prod-ucts, tobacco, corn, peanuts, and so on, so that the producers of those goods can receive higher incomes. Under a price support program, the government sets a support price P
s and then buys up whatever output is needed to keep the 
market price at this level. Figure 9.10 illustrates this. Let’s examine the resulting gains and losses to consumers, producers, and the government.
CONSUMERS  At price P
s, the quantity that consumers demand falls to Q1, but 
the quantity supplied increases to Q2. To maintain this price and avoid hav-
ing inventories pile up in producer warehouses, the government must buy the quantity Q
g /H11005 Q2 − Q1. In effect, because the government adds its demand Qg to 
the demand of consumers, producers can sell all they want at price Ps.
Because those consumers who purchase the good must pay the higher price 
Ps instead of Po, they suffer a loss of consumer surplus given by rectangle A. 
Because of the higher price, other consumers no longer buy the good or buy less of it, and their loss of surplus is given by triangle B. So, as with the minimum 
price that we examined above, consumers lose, in this case by an amount
/H9004CS=-A-B
PRODUCERS  On the other hand, producers gain (which is why such a policy is 
implemented). Producers are now selling a larger quantity Q
2 instead of Q0, and 
at a higher price Ps. Observe from Figure 9.10 that producer surplus increases 
by the amount
/H9004PS=A+B+D
THE GOVERNMENT  But there is also a cost to the government (which must 
be paid for by taxes, and so is ultimately a cost to consumers). That cost is  
(Q2 − Q1)Ps, which is what the government must pay for the output it purchases. 
In Figure 9.10, this amount is represented by the large speckled rectangle. This cost may be reduced if the government can “dump” some of its purchases—i.e., sell them abroad at a low price. Doing so, however, hurts the ability of domes-tic producers to sell in foreign markets, and it is domestic producers that the  government is trying to please in the first place.
What is the total welfare cost of this policy? To find out, we add the change in 
consumer surplus to the change in producer surplus and then subtract the cost to the government. Thus the total change in welfare is
/H9004CS+/H9004PS-Cost to Govt. =D-(Q
2-Q1)Ps• price support  Price set 
by government above free-market level and maintained by governmental purchases of excess supply.CHAPTER 9   •  The Analysis of Competitive Markets  333
8In practice, price supports for many agricultural commodities are effected through loans. The loan 
rate is in effect a price floor. If during the loan period market prices are not sufficiently high, farmers can forfeit their grain to the government (specifically to the Commodity Credit Corporation) as full 
payment for the loan.  Farmers have the incentive to do this unless the market price rises above the 
support price.Price

PRICE SUPPORTS
To maintain a price Ps above the market-clearing price P0, 
the government buys a quantity Qg. The gain to produc-
ers is A /H11001 B /H11001 D. The loss to consumers is A /H11001 B. The cost 
to the government is the speckled rectangle, the area of which is P
s(Q2 /H11002 Q1).
In terms of Figure 9.10, society as a whole is worse off by an amount given by 
the large speckled rectangle, less triangle D.
As we will see in Example 9.4, this welfare loss can be very large. But the most 
unfortunate part of this policy is the fact that there is a much more efficient way to help farmers. If the objective is to give farmers an additional income equal to A /H11001 B /H11001 D, it is far less costly to society to give them this money directly rather 
than via price supports. Because price supports are costing consumers A /H11001 B 
anyway, by paying farmers directly, society saves the large speckled rectangle, less triangle D. So why doesn’t the government simply give farmers money? 
Perhaps because price supports are a less obvious giveaway and, therefore, politically more attractive.
8
Production Quotas
Besides entering the market and buying up output—thereby increasing total demand—the government can also cause the price of a good to rise by reducing 
supply.  It can do this by decree—that is, by simply setting quotas on how much 
each firm can produce. With appropriate quotas, the price can then be forced up to any arbitrary level.
As we will see in Example 9.5, this is how many city governments main-
tain high taxi fares. They limit total supply by requiring each taxicab to have a medallion, and then limit the total number of medallions. Another example is the control of liquor licenses by state governments. By requiring any bar or res-taurant that serves alcohol to have a liquor license and then limiting the number of licenses, entry by new restaurateurs is limited, which allows those who have licenses to earn higher prices and profit margins.334  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets

SUPPLY RESTRICTIONS
To maintain a price Ps above the market-clearing price 
P0, the government can restrict supply to Q1, either by 
imposing production quotas (as with taxicab medal-lions) or by giving producers a financial incentive to re-duce output (as with acreage limitations in agriculture). For an incentive to work, it must be at least as large as B /H11001 C /H11001 D, which would be the additional profit 
earned by planting, given the higher price 
Ps. The cost 
to the government is therefore at least B /H11001 C /H11001 D.The welfare effects of production quotas are shown in Figure 9.11. The 
government restricts the quantity supplied to Q1, rather than the market-
clearing level Q0. Thus the supply curve becomes the vertical line S' at Q1. 
Consumer surplus is reduced by rectangle A (those consumers who buy the 
good pay a higher price) plus triangle B (at this higher price, some consum-
ers no longer purchase the good). Producers gain rectangle A (by selling at 
a higher price) but lose triangle C (because they now produce and sell Q1 
rather than Q0). Once again, there is a deadweight loss, given by triangles 
B and C.
INCENTIVE PROGRAMS  In U.S. agricultural policy, output is reduced by 
incentives rather than by outright quotas. Acreage limitation programs  give 
farmers financial incentives to leave some of their acreage idle. Figure 9.11 also shows the welfare effects of reducing supply in this way. Note that because farmers agree to limit planted acreage, the supply curve again becomes completely inelastic at the quantity Q
1, and the market price is 
increased from P0 to Ps.
As with direct production quotas, the change in consumer surplus is
/H9004CS=-A-B
Farmers now receive a higher price for the production Q1, which corresponds 
to a gain in surplus of rectangle A. But because production is reduced from Q0 
to Q1, there is a loss of producer surplus corresponding to triangle C. Finally, 
 farmers receive money from the government as an incentive to reduce produc-tion. Thus the total change in producer surplus is now
/H9004PS=A-C+Payments for not producingCHAPTER 9   •  The Analysis of Competitive Markets  335
The cost to the government is a payment sufficient to give farmers an incen-
tive to reduce output to Q1. That incentive must be at least as large as B /H11001 C /H11001 D 
because that area represents the additional profit that could be made by plant-ing, given the higher price 
Ps. (Remember that the higher price Ps gives farmers 
an incentive to produce more  even though the government is trying to get them 
to produce less.) Thus the cost to the government is at least B /H11001 C /H11001 D, and the 
total change in producer surplus is
/H9004PS=A-C+B+C+D=A+B+D
This is the same change in producer surplus as with price supports main-
tained by government purchases of output. (Refer to Figure 9.10.) Farmers, then, should be indifferent between the two policies because they end up gaining the same amount of money from each. Likewise, consumers lose the same amount of money.
Which policy costs the government more? The answer depends on whether 
the sum of triangles B /H11001 C /H11001 D in Figure 9.11 is larger or smaller than ( Q
2 − Q1)Ps
(the large speckled rectangle) in Figure 9.10. Usually it will be smaller, so that an 
acreage-limitation program costs the government (and society) less than price supports maintained by government purchases.
Still, even an acreage-limitation program is more costly to society than simply 
handing the farmers money. The total change in welfare ( /H9004CS+/H9004PS-Cost to 
Govt.) under the acreage-limitation program is
/H9004Welfare =-A-B+A+B+D-B-C-D=-B-C
Society would clearly be better off in efficiency terms if the government simply 
gave the farmers A /H11001 B /H11001 D, leaving price and output alone. Farmers would 
then gain A /H11001 B /H11001 D and the government would lose A /H11001 B /H11001 D, for a total 
welfare change of zero, instead of a loss of B /H11001 C. However, economic efficiency 
is not always the objective of government policy.
EXAMPLE 9.4  SUPPORTING THE PRICE OF WHEAT
In Examples 2.5 (page 37) and 4.3 (page 128), we began to examine the market for wheat in the United States. Using linear demand and supply curves, we found that the market-clearing price of wheat was about $3.46 in 1981. The price fell to about $2.78 by 2002 because of a drop in export demand. In fact, government programs kept the actual price of wheat higher and provided direct subsidies to farmers. How did these programs work, how much did they end up costing consumers, and how much did they add to the federal deficit?

THE WHEAT MARKET IN 1981
By buying 122 million bushels of wheat, the government increased the market-clearing price  
from $3.46 per bushel to $3.70.First, let’s examine the market in 1981. In that year, although there were 
no effective limitations on the production of wheat, the price was increased to $3.70 by government purchases. How much would the government have had to buy to get the price from $3.46 to $3.70? To answer this ques-tion, first write the equations for supply and for total private (domestic plus export) demand:
1981 Supply : 
 Qs=1800 +240P
1981  Demand :  QD=3550 -266P
By equating supply and demand, you can check that the market-clearing 
price is $3.46, and that the quantity produced is 2630 million bushels. Figure 9.12 illustrates this.
To increase the price to $3.70, the government must buy a quantity of 
wheat Q
g. Total  demand (private plus government) will then be
1981 Total  demand : QDT=3550 -266P+Qg
Now equate supply with this total demand:
1800 +240P=3550 -266P+Qg
or
Qg=506P-1750CHAPTER 9   •  The Analysis of Competitive Markets  337
9See Mike Allen, “Bush Signs Bill Providing Big Farm Subsidy Increases,” The Washington Post , May 
14, 2002; see David E. Sanger, “Reversing Course, Bush Signs Bill Raising Farm Subsidies,” The New 
York Times , May 14, 2002.This equation can be used to determine the required quantity of government 
wheat purchases Qg as a function of the desired support price P. To achieve a 
price of $3.70, the government must buy
Qg=(506)(3.70) -1750 =122  million  bushels
Note in Figure 9.12 that these 122 million bushels are the difference 
between the quantity supplied at the $3.70 price (2688 million bushels) and the quantity of private demand (2566 million bushels). The figure also shows the gains and losses to consumers and producers. Recall that consumers lose rectangle A and triangle B. You can verify that rectangle A is (3.70 − 3.46)
(2566) /H11005 $616 million, and triangle B is (1/2)(3.70 − 3.46)(2630 − 2566) /H11005 $8 
million, so that the total cost to consumers is $624 million.
The cost to the government is the $3.70 it pays for the wheat times the 
122 million bushels it buys, or $451.4 million. The total cost of the program is then $624 million /H11001 $451.4 million /H11005 $1075 million. Compare this with the 
gain to producers, which is rectangle A plus triangles B and C. You can verify 
that this gain is $638 million.
Price supports for wheat were expensive in 1981. To increase the sur-
plus of farmers by $638 million, consumers and taxpayers had to pay $1076  million. In fact, taxpayers paid even more than that. Wheat producers were 
also given subsidies of about 30 cents per bushel, which adds up to another $806 million.
In 1996, the U.S. Congress passed a new farm bill, nicknamed the 
“Freedom to Farm” law. It was designed to reduce the role of govern-ment and to make agriculture more market oriented. The law elimi-nated production quotas (for wheat, corn, rice, and other products) and gradually reduced government purchases and subsidies through 2003. However, the law did not completely deregulate U.S. agriculture. For example, price support programs for peanuts and sugar remained in place. Furthermore, pre-1996 price supports and production quotas would be reinstated unless Congress renewed the law in 2003. (Congress did not renew it—more on this below.) Even under the 1996 law, agricul-tural subsidies remained substantial.
In Example 2.5, we saw that the market-clearing price of wheat in 2007 
had increased to about $6.00 per bushel. The supply and demand curves in 2007 were as follows:
Demand :
  QD=2900 -125P
 Supply : QS=1460 +115P
You can check to see that the market-clearing quantity is 2150 million 
 bushels.
Congress did not renew the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act. Instead, in 2002, 
Congress and the Bush administration essentially reversed the effects of the 1996 bill through passage of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act, which reinstates subsidies for most crops, in particular grain and  cotton.

prices can be found at New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission’s website: http://www.nyc.
gov/tlc , and at http://www.schallerconsult.com/taxi/ .Although the bill does not explicitly restore price supports, it calls for the 
government to issue “fixed direct payments” to producers based on a fixed payment rate and the base acreage for a particular crop. Using U.S. wheat acreage and production levels in 2001, we can calculate that this bill cost taxpayers nearly $1.1 billion in annual payments to wheat producers alone.
10 
The 2002 farm bill was projected to cost taxpayers $190 billion over 10 years.
Congress revisited agricultural subsidies in 2007. For most crops, previous 
subsidy rates were either maintained or increased, thus making the burden on U.S. taxpayers even higher. In fact, the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 raised subsidy rates on most crops through 2012, at a projected cost of $284 billion over five years. Recently, however, the pendulum has swung back toward eliminating subsidies, and new cuts were approved as part of the deal to resolve the 2011 budget crisis.
EXAMPLE 9.5  WHY CAN’T I FIND A TAXI?
Ever try to catch a cab in New York? Good luck! If it’s raining or it’s a peak commuting time, you can wait an hour before successfully hailing a cab. Why? Why aren’t there more taxis in New York?
The reason is simple. The city of New York limits 
the number of taxis by requiring each taxi to have a medallion  (essentially a permit), and then limit-
ing the number of medallions. In 2011 there were 13,150 medallions in New York—roughly the same number as in 1937, a time when it was much easier to find a taxi. But since 1937 the city has grown and the demand for taxi rides has increased greatly, so that now the limit of 13,150 medallions is a con-straint that can make life difficult for New Yorkers. But that just raises another question. Why would a city do something that makes life difficult for its citi-zens? Why not just issue more medallions?
Again, the reason is simple. Doing so would incur 
the wrath of the current owners of medallions—mostly large taxi companies that lease the medal-lions and taxis to drivers, and have  considerable 
political and lobbying power. Medallions can be bought and sold by the companies that own them. In 1937, there were plenty of medallions to go around, so they had little value. By 1947, the value of a medallion had increased to $2,500, by 1980 to $55,000, and by 2011 to $880,000. That’s right—because New York City won’t issue more medallions, the value of a taxi medallion is approaching $1 million! But of course that value would drop sharply if the city starting issuing more medallions. So the New York taxi companies that collectively own the 13,150 available medallions have done everything possible to prevent the city from issuing any more—and have succeeded in their efforts.
The situation is illustrated in Figure 9.13. The 
demand curve D and supply curve S are based 
on elasticities taken from statistical studies of taxi-cab markets in New York and other cities.

The demand curve D shows the quantity of medallions demanded by taxi companies as a function of the price 
of a medallion. The supply curve S shows the number of medallions that would be sold by current owners as 
a function of price. New York limits the quantity to 13,150, so the supply curve becomes vertical and intersects demand at $880,000, the market price of a medallion in 2011.
city were to issue another 7,000 medallions for a 
total of about 20,000, demand and supply would  equilibrate at a price of about $350,000 per medal-
lion – still a lot, but just enough to lease cabs, run a taxi business, and still make a profit. But supply is constrained at 13,150, at which point the supply curve (labeled S’) becomes vertical, and intersects 
the demand curve at a price of $880,000.
Keep in mind that New York’s medallion policy 
hurts taxi drivers as well as citizens who depend on taxis. Most of the medallions are owned by large taxi companies—not by drivers, who must lease them from the companies (a small portion are reserved for owner-operators). To become a taxi driver, one must take a road test and be certified. In 2011, there were 
44,000 certified drivers in New York, but only 13,150 of them can drive a cab at any one time, leaving many unemployed.
Is New York City unique in its treatment of taxis? 
Not at all. In Boston there were only 1,825 medal-lions available in 2010, and medallions were bought and sold at a price of $410,000. And just try to find a taxi in Milan, Rome, or almost any other Italian city. The Italian government severely constrains the  numbers of medallions, which are owned not by 
large taxi companies as in New York, but by individ-ual families, who have the political clout to preserve the value of their precious medallions.340  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
9.5  Import Quotas and Tariffs
Many countries use import quotas  and tariffs  to keep the domestic price of a 
product above world levels and thereby enable the domestic industry to enjoy higher profits than it would under free trade. As we will see, the cost to taxpay-ers from this protection can be high, with the loss to consumers exceeding the gain to domestic producers.
Without a quota or tariff, a country will import a good when its world price is 
below the price that would prevail domestically were there no imports. Figure 9.14 illustrates this principle. S and D are the domestic supply and demand curves. If 
there were no imports, the domestic price and quantity would be P
0 and Q0, which 
equate supply and demand. But because the world price Pw is below P0, domestic 
consumers have an incentive to purchase from abroad and will do so if imports are not restricted. How much will be imported? The domestic price will fall to the world price P
w; at this lower price, domestic production will fall to Qs, and domes-
tic consumption will rise to Qd. Imports are then the difference between domestic 
consumption and domestic production, Qd − Qs.
Now suppose the government, bowing to pressure from the domestic indus-
try, eliminates imports by imposing a quota of zero—that is, forbidding any importation of the good. What are the gains and losses from such a policy?
With no imports allowed, the domestic price will rise to P
0. Consumers who 
still purchase the good (in quantity Q0) will pay more and will lose an amount of 
surplus given by trapezoid A and triangle B. In addition, given this higher price, 
some consumers will no longer buy the good, so there is an additional loss of consumer surplus, given by triangle C. The total change in consumer surplus is

IMPORT TARIFF OR QUOTA THAT  
ELIMINATES IMPORTS
In a free market, the domestic price equals the 
world price Pw. A total Qd is consumed, of which 
Qs is supplied domestically and the rest  imported. 
When imports are eliminated, the price is in-
creased to P0. The gain to producers is trapezoid 
A. The loss to consumers is A /H11001 B /H11001 C, so the 
deadweight loss is B /H11001 C.CHAPTER 9   •  The Analysis of Competitive Markets  341
What about producers? Output is now higher ( Q0 instead of Qs) and is sold 
at a higher price ( P0 instead of Pw). Producer surplus therefore increases by the 
amount of trapezoid A:
/H9004PS=A
The change in total surplus, /H9004CS+/H9004PS, is therefore − B − C. Again, there is a 
deadweight loss—consumers lose more than producers gain.
Imports could also be reduced to zero by imposing a sufficiently large tariff. 
The tariff would have to be equal to or greater than the difference between P0 
and Pw. With a tariff of this size, there will be no imports and, therefore, no gov-
ernment revenue from tariff collections, so the effect on consumers and produc-ers would be the same as with a quota.
More often, government policy is designed to reduce but not eliminate 
imports. Again, this can be done with either a tariff or a quota, as Figure 9.15 shows. Under free trade, the domestic price will equal the world price P
w, and 
imports will be Qd − Qs. Now suppose that a tariff of T dollars per unit is imposed 
on imports. Then the domestic price will rise to P* (the world price plus the 
 tariff); domestic production will rise and domestic consumption will fall.
In Figure 9.15, this tariff leads to a change of consumer surplus given by

Finally, the government will collect revenue in the amount of the tariff times the

EXAMPLE 9.6  THE SUGAR QUOTA
In recent years, the world price of sugar 
has been between 10 and 28 cents per 
pound, while the U.S. price has been 
30 to 40 cents per pound. Why? By 
restricting imports, the U.S. govern-
ment protects the $4 billion domestic 
sugar industry, which would virtually be 
put out of business if it had to com-
pete with low-cost foreign producers. 
This policy has been good for U.S. sugar producers. It has even been good 
for some foreign sugar producers—in particular, those whose successful 
lobbying efforts have given them big shares of the quota. But like most 
policies of this sort, it has been bad for consumers.
To see just how bad, let’s look at the sugar market in 2010. Here are the 
relevant data for that year:
U.S. production: 15.9 billion pounds
U.S. consumption: 22.8 billion pounds
U.S. price: 36 cents per pound
World price: 24 cents per pound
imports. ( B represents the loss from domestic overproduction and C the loss 
from too little consumption.)
Suppose the government uses a quota instead of a tariff to restrict imports: 
Foreign producers can only ship a specific quantity ( Q'd − Q's in Figure 9.15) to 
the United States and can then charge the higher price P* for their U.S. sales. 
The changes in U.S. consumer and producer surplus will be the same as with 
the  tariff, but instead of the U.S. government collecting the revenue given by 
rectangle D, this money will go to the foreign producers in the form of higher 
profits. The United States as a whole will be even worse off than it was under 
the tariff,  losing D as well as the deadweight loss B and C.12
This situation is exactly what transpired with automobile imports from 
Japan in the 1980s. Under pressure from domestic automobile producers, 
the Reagan administration negotiated “voluntary” import restraints, under 
which the Japanese agreed to restrict shipments of cars to the United States. 
The Japanese could therefore sell those cars that were shipped at a price 
higher than the world level and capture a higher profit margin on each one. 
The United States would have been better off by simply imposing a tariff on 
these imports.
12Alternatively, an import quota can be maintained by rationing imports to U.S. importing firms 
or trading companies. These middlemen would have the rights to import a fixed amount of the 
good each year. These rights are valuable because the middleman can buy the product on the world 
market at price Pw and then sell it at price P*. The aggregate value of these rights is, therefore, given 
by rectangle D. If the government sells the rights for this amount of money, it can capture the same 
revenue it would receive with a tariff. But if these rights are given away, as sometimes happens, the 
money becomes a windfall to middlemen.CHAPTER 9   •  The Analysis of Competitive Markets  343

tion at http://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefing/Sugar/Data.htm . The elasticity estimates are based 
on Morris E. Morkre and David G. Tarr, Effects of Restrictions on United States Imports: Five Case 
Studies and Theory , U.S. Federal Trade Commission Staff Report, June 1981; and F. M. Scherer, 
“The United States Sugar Program,” Kennedy School of Government Case Study, Harvard University, 1992. For a general discussion of sugar quotas and other aspects of U.S. agricultural policy, see D. Gale Johnson, Agricultural Policy and Trade  (New York: New York University Press, 
1985); and Gail L. Cramer and Clarence W. Jensen, Agricultural Economics and Agribusiness  (New 
York: Wiley, 1985).At these prices and quantities, the price elasticity of U.S. supply is 1.5, and 
the price elasticity of U.S. demand is −0.3.13
We will fit linear supply and demand curves to these data, and then use 
them to calculate the effects of the quotas. You can verify that the f ollowing 
U.S. supply curve is consistent with a production level of 15.9 billion pounds, a price of 36 cents per pound, and a supply elasticity of 1.5:
U.S.
 supply :  QS=-7.95 +0.66P
where quantity is measured in billions of pounds and price in cents per 
pound. Similarly, the −0.3 demand elasticity, together with the data for U.S. consumption and U.S. price, give the following linear demand curve:
U.S.
 demand :  QD=29.73 -0.19P
These supply and demand curves are plotted in Figure 9.16. Using 
the U.S. supply and demand curves given above, you can check that at the 24-cent world price, U.S. production would have been only about  
7.9 billion pounds and U.S. consumption about 25.2 billion pounds, of which 25.2 − 7.9 /H11005 17.3 billion pounds would have been imported. But fortunately 
for U.S. producers, imports were limited to only 6.9 billion pounds.
What did limit on imports do to the U.S. price? To find out, use the U.S. 
supply and demand equations, and set the quantity demanded minus the quantity supplied to 6.9:
Q
S-QD=(29.73 -0.19P)-(-7.95 +0.66P)=6.9
You can check that the solution to this equation is P /H11005 36.2 cents. Thus 
the limit on imports pushed the U.S. price up to about 36 cents, as shown in the figure.
What did this policy cost U.S. consumers? The lost consumer surplus is 
given by the sum of trapezoid A, triangles B and C, and rectangle D. You 
should go through the calculations to verify that trapezoid A is equal to $1431 
million, triangle B to $477 million, triangle C to $137 million, and rectangle D 
to $836 million. The total cost to consumers in 2010 was about $2.9 billion.
How much did producers gain from this policy? Their increase in sur-
plus is given by trapezoid A (i.e., about $1.4 billion). The $836 million of 
rectangle D was a gain for those foreign producers who succeeded in 
obtaining large allotments of the quota because they received a higher In §2.6, we explain how to 
fit linear supply and demand functions to data of this kind.344  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
price for their sugar. Triangles B and C represent a deadweight loss of 
about $614 million.
The world price of sugar has been volatile over the past decade. In the 
mid-2000s, the European Union removed protections on European sugar, causing the region to go from being a net sugar exporter to a net importer. Meanwhile, demand for sugar in rapidly industrializing countries like India, Pakistan and China has skyrocketed. Sugar production in these three coun-tries is often unpredictable: while they are often net exporters, changing governmental policies and volatile weather frequently lead to decreased output, forcing them to import sugar to meet domestic demand. In addi-tion, many countries, like Brazil, also use sugar to make ethanol, further decreasing the amount available for food.PUS /H11005 36

SUGAR QUOTA IN 2010
At the world price of 24 cents per pound, about 25.2 billion pounds of sugar would have been consumed in 
the United States in 2010, of which all but 7.9 billion pounds would have been imported. Restricting imports to 6.9 billion pounds caused the U.S. price to go up by 12 cents. The cost to consumers, A

about $2.9 billion. The gain to domestic producers was trapezoid A, about $1.4 billion. Rectangle D, $836

the deadweight loss of about $614 million.CHAPTER 9   •  The Analysis of Competitive Markets  345
9.6  The Impact of a Tax or Subsidy
What would happen to the price of widgets if the government imposed a $1 tax 
on every widget sold? Many people would answer that the price would increase by a dollar, with consumers now paying a dollar more per widget than they would have paid without the tax. But this answer is wrong.
Or consider the following question. The government wants to impose a 
50-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline and is considering two methods of collect-ing it. Under Method 1, the owner of each gas station would deposit the tax money (50 cents times the number of gallons sold) in a locked box, to be col-lected by a government agent. Under Method 2, the buyer would pay the tax (50 cents times the number of gallons purchased) directly to the government. Which method costs the buyer more? Many people would say Method 2, but this answer is also wrong.
The burden of a tax (or the benefit of a subsidy) falls partly on the consumer 
and partly on the producer. Furthermore, it does not matter who puts the money in the collection box (or sends the check to the government)—Methods 1 and 2 both cost the consumer the same amount of money. As we will see, the share of a tax borne by consumers depends on the shapes of the supply and demand curves and, in particular, on the relative elasticities of supply and demand. As for our first question, a $1 tax on widgets would indeed cause the price to rise, but usu-ally by less than a dollar and sometimes by much  less. To understand why, let’s 
use supply and demand curves to see how consumers and producers are affected when a tax is imposed on a product, and what happens to price and quantity.
THE EFFECTS OF A SPECIFIC TAX  For the sake of simplicity, we will consider a 
specific tax —a tax of a certain amount of money per unit sold.  This is in contrast to 
an ad valorem  (i.e., proportional) tax, such as a state sales tax. (The analysis of an ad 
valorem tax is roughly the same and yields the same qualitative results.) Examples of specific taxes include federal and state taxes on gasoline and  cigarettes.
Suppose the government imposes a tax of t cents per unit on widgets. 
Assuming that everyone obeys the law, the government must then receive t 
cents for every widget sold. This means that the price the buyer pays must exceed the 
net price the seller receives by t cents.  Figure 9.17 illustrates this simple accounting 
relationship—and its implications. Here, P
0 and Q0 represent the market price 
and quantity before  the tax is imposed. Pb is the price that buyers pay, and Ps is 
the net price that sellers receive after the tax is imposed. Note that Pb − Ps /H11005 t, so 
the government is happy.
How do we determine what the market quantity will be after the tax is imposed, 
and how much of the tax is borne by buyers and how much by sellers? First, remember that what buyers care about is the price that they must pay: P
b. The 
amount that they will buy is given by the demand curve; it is the quantity that we read off of the demand curve given a price P
b. Similarly, sellers care about the net 
price they receive, Ps. Given Ps, the quantity that they will produce and sell is read 
off the supply curve. Finally, we know that the quantity sold must equal the quan-tity bought. The solution, then, is to find the quantity that corresponds to a price of P
b on the demand curve, and a price of Ps on the supply curve, such that the 
difference Pb − Ps is equal to the tax t. In Figure 9.17, this quantity is shown as Q1.
Who bears the burden of the tax? In Figure 9.17, this burden is shared roughly 
equally by buyers and sellers. The market price (the price buyers pay) rises by half of the tax, and the price that sellers receive falls by roughly half of the tax.• specific tax  Tax of a certain 
amount of money per unit sold.346  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
As Figure 9.17 shows, market clearing requires four conditions  to be satisfied 
after the tax is in place:
 1. The quantity sold and the buyer’s price Pb must lie on the demand curve 
(because buyers are interested only in the price they must pay).
 2. The quantity sold and the seller’s price Ps must lie on the supply curve 
(because sellers are concerned only with the amount of money they receive net of the tax).
 3. The quantity demanded must equal the quantity supplied ( Q
1 in the figure).
 4. The difference between the price the buyer pays and the price the seller 
receives must equal the tax t.
These conditions can be summarized by the following four equations:
 QD=QD(Pb) (9.1a)
 QS=QS(Ps) (9.1b)
 QD=QS (9.1c)
 Pb-Ps=t (9.1d)
If we know the demand curve QD(Pb), the supply curve QS(Ps), and the size of 
the tax t, we can solve these equations for the buyers’ price Pb, the sellers’ price 
Ps, and the total quantity demanded and supplied. This task is not as difficult as 
it may seem, as we will demonstrate in Example 9.7.
Figure 9.17 also shows that a tax results in a deadweight loss.  Because buyers 
pay a higher price, there is a change in consumer surplus given by

INCIDENCE OF A TAX
Pb is the price (including the tax) paid by buyers. 
Ps is the price that sellers receive, less the tax. 
Here the burden of the tax is split evenly between buyers and sellers. Buyers lose A 
/H11001 B, sellers lose 
D /H11001 C, and the government earns A /H11001 D in rev-
enue. The deadweight loss is B /H11001 C.CHAPTER 9   •  The Analysis of Competitive Markets  347
Because sellers now receive a lower price, there is also a change in producer 
surplus given by
/H9004PS=-C-D
Government tax revenue is tQ1, the sum of rectangles A and D. The total change 
in welfare, /H9004CS plus /H9004PS plus the revenue to the government, is  therefore − A − 
B − C − D /H11001 A /H11001 D /H11005 −B − C. Triangles B and C represent the deadweight loss 
from the tax.
In Figure 9.17, the burden of the tax is shared almost evenly between buy-
ers and sellers, but this is not always the case. If demand is relatively inelas-tic and supply is relatively elastic, the burden of the tax will fall mostly on buyers. Figure 9.18(a) shows why: It takes a relatively large increase in price to reduce the quantity demanded by even a small amount, whereas only a small price decrease is needed to reduce the quantity supplied. For example, because  cigarettes are addictive, the elasticity of demand is small (about −0.4); thus federal and state cigarette taxes are borne largely by cigarette buyers.

IMPACT OF A TAX DEPENDS ON ELASTICITIES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND
(a) If demand is very inelastic relative to supply, the burden of the tax falls mostly on buyers. 
(b) If demand is very elastic relative to supply, it falls mostly on sellers.348  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
Figure 9.18(b) shows the opposite case: If demand is relatively elastic and sup-
ply is relatively inelastic, the burden of the tax will fall mostly on sellers.
So even if we have only estimates of the elasticities of demand and supply 
at a point or for a small range of prices and quantities, instead of the entire demand and supply curves, we can still roughly determine who will bear the greatest burden of a tax (whether the tax is actually in effect or is only under discussion as a policy option). In general, a tax falls mostly on the buyer if E
d/Es is 
small, and mostly on the seller if Ed/Es is large.
In fact, by using the following “pass-through” formula, we can calculate the 
percentage of the tax borne by buyers:
Pass @through fraction =Es/(Es-Ed)
This formula tells us what fraction of the tax is “passed through” to consum-
ers in the form of higher prices. For example, when demand is totally inelas-tic, so that E
d is zero, the pass-through fraction is 1 and all the tax is borne by 
 consumers. When demand is totally elastic, the pass-through fraction is zero and producers bear all the tax. (The fraction of the tax that producers bear is given by − E
d/(Es − Ed).)
The Effects of a Subsidy
A subsidy  can be analyzed in much the same way as a tax—in fact, you can 
think of a subsidy as a negative tax.  With a subsidy, the sellers’ price exceeds  
the buyers’ price, and the difference between the two is the amount of the subsidy. As you would expect, the effect of a subsidy on the quantity pro-duced and consumed is just the opposite of the effect of a tax—the quantity will increase.
Figure 9.19 illustrates this. At the presubsidy market price P
0, the elasticities 
of supply and demand are roughly equal. As a result, the benefit of the subsidy is shared roughly equally between buyers and sellers. As with a tax, this is not always the case. In general, the benefit of a subsidy accrues mostly to buyers if E
d/Es 
is small and mostly to sellers if Ed/Es is large.• subsidy  Payment reducing

EXAMPLE 9.7  A TAX ON GASOLINE
The idea of a large tax on gasoline, 
both to raise government revenue and 
to reduce oil consumption and U.S. 
dependence on oil imports, has been 
discussed for many years. Let’s see how 
a $1.00-per-gallon tax would affect the 
price and consumption of gasoline.
We will do this analysis in the set-
ting of market conditions during 
2005–2010—when gasoline was selling for about $2 per gallon on average 
and total consumption was about 100 billion gallons per year (bg/yr).15 We 
will also use intermediate-run elasticities: elasticities that would apply to a 
period of about three to six years after a price change.
A reasonable number for the intermediate-run elasticity of gasoline 
demand is −0.5 (see Example 2.6 in Chapter 2—page 43). We can use this 
figure, together with the $2 and 100 bg/yr price and quantity numbers, to 
calculate a  linear demand curve for gasoline. You can verify that the follow-
ing demand curve fits these data:
Gasolinedemand : QD=150 -25P
Gasoline is refined from crude oil, some of which is produced domesti-
cally and some imported. (Some gasoline is also imported directly.) The 
supply curve for gasoline will therefore depend on the world price of 
oil, on  domestic oil supply, and on the cost of refining. The details are 
beyond the scope of this example, but a reasonable number for the elas-
ticity of supply is 0.4. You should verify that this elasticity, together with 
In §2.5, we explain that 
demand is often more price 
elastic in the long run than in 
the short run because it takes 
time for people to change 
their consumption habits 
and/or because the demand 
for a good might be linked 
to the stock of another good 
that changes slowly.
For a review of the proce-
dure for calculating linear 
curves, see §2.6. Given data 
for price and quantity, as 
well as estimates of demand 
and supply elasticities, we 
can use a two-step proce-
dure to solve for quantity 
demanded and supplied.
15Of course, this price varied across regions and grades of gasoline, but we can ignore this here. 
Quantities of oil and oil products are often measured in barrels; there are 42 gallons in a barrel, so 
the quantity figure could also be written as 2.4 billion barrels per year.As with a tax, given the supply curve, the demand curve, and the size of 
the subsidy s, we can solve for the resulting prices and quantity. The same four 
conditions needed for the market to clear apply for a subsidy as for a tax, but 
now the difference between the sellers’ price and the buyers’ price is equal to the 
subsidy. Again, we can write these conditions algebraically:
 QD=QD(Pb) (9.2a)
 QS=QS(Ps) (9.2b)
 QD=QS (9.2c)
 Ps-Pb=s (9.2d)
To make sure you understand how to analyze the impact of a tax or sub-
sidy, you might find it helpful to work through one or two examples, such as 
Exercises 2 and 14 at the end of this chapter.350  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
the $2 and 100 bg/yr price and quantity, gives the following linear supply 
curve:
Gasoline  supply : QS=60+20P
You should also verify that these demand and supply curves imply a mar-
ket price of $2 and quantity of 100 bg/yr.
We can use these linear demand and supply curves to calculate the effect 
of a $1-per-gallon tax. First, we write the four conditions that must hold, as given by equations (9.2a–d):
Q
D=150-25Pb(Demand)
QS=60+20Ps(Supply)
QD=QS(Supply must equal demand)
Pb=Ps=1.00 (Government must receive $1.00/gallon)
Now combine the first three equations to equate supply and demand:
150 -25Pb=60+20Ps
We can rewrite the last of the four equations as Pb=Ps /H11001 1.00 and sub-
stitute this for Pb in the above equation:
150 -25(Ps+1.00) =60+20Ps
Now we can rearrange this equation and solve for Ps:
20Ps+25Ps=150 -25-60
45Ps=65, or Ps=1.44
Remember that Pb /H11005 Ps /H11001 1.00, so Pb /H11005 2.44. Finally, we can determine the 
total quantity from either the demand or supply curve. Using the demand curve (and the price P
b /H11005 2.44), we find that Q /H11005 150 − (25) (2.44) /H11005 150 − 
61, or Q /H11005 89 bg/yr. This represents an 11-percent decline in gasoline con-
sumption. Figure 9.20 illustrates these calculations and the effect of the tax.
The burden of this tax would be split roughly evenly between consumers 
and producers. Consumers would pay about 44 cents per gallon more for gas-oline, and producers would receive about 56 cents per gallon less. It should not be surprising, then, that both consumers and producers opposed such a tax, and politicians representing both groups fought the proposal every time it came up. But note that the tax would raise significant revenue for the gov-ernment. The annual revenue would be tQ /H11005 (1.00)(89) /H11005 $89 billion per year.
The cost to consumers and producers, however, will be more than the 
$89 billion in tax revenue. Figure 9.20 shows the deadweight loss from this tax as the two shaded triangles. The two rectangles A and D represent the 
total tax collected by the government, but the total loss of consumer and producer surplus is larger.
Before deciding whether a gasoline tax is  desirable, it is important to 
know how large the resulting deadweight loss is likely to be. We can easily CHAPTER 9   •  The Analysis of Competitive Markets  351
calculate this from Figure 9.20. Combining the two small triangles into one 
large one, we see that the area is
(1/2) *($1.00/gallon) *(11  billion gallons/year)
=$5.5  billion per year

ing from the tax, and must be balanced against any additional benefits that the tax might bring.Price

SUMMARY
 1. Simple models of supply and demand can be used to 
analyze a wide variety of government policies, includ-ing price controls, minimum prices, price support pro-grams, production quotas or incentive programs to limit output, import tariffs and quotas, and taxes and subsidies.
 2. In each case, consumer and producer surplus are used 
to evaluate the gains and losses to consumers and  producers. Applying the methodology to natural gas price controls, airline regulation, price supports for wheat, and the sugar quota shows that these gains and losses can be quite large. 3. When government imposes a tax or subsidy, price usu-
ally does not rise or fall by the full amount of the tax or subsidy. Also, the incidence of a tax or subsidy is usually split between producers and consumers. The fraction that each group ends up paying or receiv-ing depends on the relative elasticities of supply and demand.
 4. Government intervention generally leads to a dead-
weight loss; even if consumer surplus and producer surplus are weighted equally, there will be a net loss from government policies that shifts surplus from one group to the other. In some cases, this deadweight loss 352  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets
will be small, but in other cases—price supports and 
import quotas are examples—it is large. This dead-weight loss is a form of economic inefficiency that must be taken into account when policies are designed and implemented.
 5. Government intervention in a competitive market 
is not always bad. Government—and the society it  represents—might have objectives other than eco-
nomic efficiency. There are also situations in which government intervention can improve economic  efficiency. Examples are externalities and cases of market failure. These situations, and the way gov-ernment can respond to them, are discussed in Chapters 17 and 18.
QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW
 1. What is meant by deadweight loss?  Why does a price 
ceiling usually result in a deadweight loss?
 2. Suppose the supply curve for a good is completely 
inelastic. If the government imposed a price ceiling below the market-clearing level, would a deadweight loss result? Explain.
 3. How can a price ceiling make consumers better off? 
Under what conditions might it make them worse off?
 4. Suppose the government regulates the price of a good 
to be no lower than some minimum level. Can such a minimum price make producers as a whole worse off? Explain.
 5. How are production limits used in practice to raise the 
prices of the following goods or services: (a) taxi rides, (b) drinks in a restaurant or bar, (c) wheat or corn? 6. Suppose the government wants to increase farmers’ 
incomes. Why do price supports or acreage-limitation programs cost society more than simply giving farm-ers money?
 7. Suppose the government wants to limit imports of a 
certain good. Is it preferable to use an import quota or a tariff? Why?
 8. The burden of a tax is shared by producers and con-
sumers. Under what conditions will consumers pay most of the tax? Under what conditions will producers pay most of it? What determines the share of a subsidy that benefits consumers?
 9. Why does a tax create a deadweight loss? What deter-

 1. From time to time, Congress has raised the minimum 
wage. Some people suggested that a government sub-sidy could help employers finance the higher wage. This exercise examines the economics of a minimum wage and wage subsidies. Suppose the supply of low-skilled labor is given by
L
s=10w
where LS is the quantity of low-skilled labor (in 
 millions of persons employed each year), and w is the 
wage rate (in dollars per hour). The demand for labor is given by
L
D=80-10w
 a. What will be the free-market wage rate and 
employment level? Suppose the government sets a minimum wage of $5 per hour. How many people would then be employed?
 b. Suppose that instead of a minimum wage, the govern-
ment pays a subsidy of $1 per hour for each employee. 
What will the total level of employment be now? What will the equilibrium wage rate be? 2. Suppose the market for widgets can be described by 
the following equations:
Demand : P=10-Q
Supply : P=Q-4
where P is the price in dollars per unit and Q is the 
quantity in thousands of units. Then:
 a. What is the equilibrium price and quantity?
 b. Suppose the government imposes a tax of $1 per 
unit to reduce widget consumption and raise gov-ernment revenues. What will the new equilibrium quantity be? What price will the buyer pay? What amount per unit will the seller receive?
 c. Suppose the government has a change of heart 
about the importance of widgets to the happiness of the American public. The tax is removed and a subsidy of $1 per unit granted to widget producers. What will the equilibrium quantity be? What price will the buyer pay? What amount per unit (includ-ing the subsidy) will the seller receive? What will be the total cost to the government?

land and to their inability to take advantage of econo-
mies of large-scale production. Analyze two policies intended to maintain Japanese rice production: (1) a per-pound subsidy to farmers for each pound of rice produced, or (2) a per-pound tariff on imported rice. Illustrate with supply-and-demand diagrams the equilibrium price and quantity, domestic rice  production, government revenue or deficit, and dead-weight loss from each policy. Which policy is the Japanese government likely to prefer? Which policy are Japanese farmers likely to prefer?
 4. In 1983, the Reagan administration introduced a new 
agricultural program called the Payment-in-Kind Program. To see how the program worked, let’s con-sider the wheat market:
 a. Suppose the demand function is Q
D /H11005 28 − 2 P and 
the supply function is QS /H11005 4 /H11001 4P, where P is the 
price of wheat in dollars per bushel, and Q is the 
quantity in billions of bushels. Find the free-market equilibrium price and quantity.
 b. Now suppose the government wants to lower the 
supply of wheat by 25 percent from the free-market equilibrium by paying farmers to withdraw land from production. However, the payment is made in wheat rather than in dollars—hence the name of the program. The wheat comes from vast government reserves accumulated from previous price support programs. The amount of wheat paid is equal to the amount that could have been harvested on the land withdrawn from production. Farmers are free to sell this wheat on the market. How much is now produced by farmers? How much is indirectly sup-plied to the market by the government? What is the new market price? How much do farmers gain? Do consumers gain or lose?
 c. Had the government not given the wheat back to 
the farmers, it would have stored or destroyed it. Do taxpayers gain from the program? What poten-tial problems does the program create?
 5. About 100 million pounds of jelly beans are consumed 
in the United States each year, and the price has been about 50 cents per pound. However, jelly bean produc-ers feel that their incomes are too low and have con-vinced the government that price supports are in order. The government will therefore buy up as many jelly beans as necessary to keep the price at $1 per pound. However, government economists are worried about the impact of this program because they have no esti-mates of the elasticities of jelly bean demand or supply.
 a. Could this program cost the government more  
than $50 million per year? Under what conditions? Could it cost less than $50 million per year? Under 
what conditions? Illustrate with a diagram.
 b. Could this program cost consumers (in terms 
of lost consumer surplus) more  than $50 million 
per year? Under what conditions? Could it cost consumers less than $50 million per year? 
Under what conditions? Again, use a diagram to illustrate.
 6. In Exercise 4 in Chapter 2 (page 62), we examined a 
vegetable fiber traded in a competitive world market and imported into the United States at a world price of $9 per pound. U.S. domestic supply and demand for various price levels are shown in the following table.

Answer the following questions about the U.S. market:
 a. Confirm that the demand curve is given by 
QD /H11005 40 − 2 P, and that the supply curve is given by 
QS /H11005 2/3P.
 b. Confirm that if there were no restrictions on

 c. If the United States imposes a tariff of $3 per pound, 
what will be the U.S. price and level of imports? How much revenue will the government earn from the tariff? How large is the deadweight loss?
 d. If the United States has no tariff but imposes an 
import quota of 8 million pounds, what will be the U.S. domestic price? What is the cost of this quota for U.S. consumers of the fiber? What is the gain for U.S. producers?
 7. The United States currently imports all of its coffee. 
The annual demand for coffee by U.S. consumers is given by the demand curve Q /H11005 250 − 10 P, where Q 
is quantity (in millions of pounds) and P is the market 
price per pound of coffee. World producers can har-vest and ship coffee to U.S. distributors at a constant marginal ( /H11005 average) cost of $8 per pound. U.S. dis-
tributors can in turn distribute coffee for a constant $2 per pound. The U.S. coffee market is competitive. Congress is considering a tariff on coffee imports of $2 per pound.
 a. If there is no tariff, how much do consumers 
pay for a pound of coffee? What is the quantity demanded?
 b. If the tariff is imposed, how much will consumers 
pay for a pound of coffee? What is the quantity demanded?354  PART 2   •  Producers, Consumers, and Competitive Markets

 a. What would be the new U.S. domestic price?
 b. How much would consumers gain and domestic

 12. The domestic supply and demand curves for hula 
beans are as follows:
Supply : P=50+Q
Demand : P=200-2Q
where P is the price in cents per pound and Q is the quan-
tity in millions of pounds. The U.S. is a small  producer in the world hula bean market, where the current price (which will not be affected by anything we do) is 60 cents per pound. Congress is considering a tariff of 40 cents per pound. Find the domestic price of hula beans that will result if the tariff is imposed. Also compute the dollar gain or loss to domestic consumers, domestic pro-ducers, and government revenue from the tariff.
 13. Currently, the social security payroll tax in the United 
States is evenly divided between employers and employees. Employers must pay the government a tax of 6.2 percent of the wages they pay, and employ-ees must pay 6.2 percent of the wages they receive. Suppose the tax were changed so that employers paid the full 12.4 percent and employees paid nothing. Would employees be better off?
 14. You know that if a tax is imposed on a particular 
product, the burden of the tax is shared by produc-ers and consumers. You also know that the demand for  automobiles is characterized by a stock adjust-ment process. Suppose a special 20-percent sales tax is  suddenly imposed on automobiles. Will the share of the tax paid by consumers rise, fall, or stay the 
same over time? Explain briefly. Repeat for a 50-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax.
 15. In 2011, Americans smoked 16 billion packs of 
 cigarettes. They paid an average retail price of $5.00 per pack.
 a. Given that the elasticity of supply is 0.5 and the 
elasticity of demand is −0.4, derive linear demand and supply curves for cigarettes.
 b. Cigarettes are subject to a federal tax, which was 
about $1.00 per pack in 2011. What does this tax do to the market-clearing price and quantity?
 c. How much of the federal tax will consumers pay? 
What part will producers pay? c. Calculate the lost consumer surplus.
 d. Calculate the tax revenue collected by the govern-
ment.
 e. Does the tariff result in a net gain or a net loss to 
society as a whole?
 8. A particular metal is traded in a highly competi-
tive world market at a world price of $9 per ounce. Unlimited quantities are available for import into the United States at this price. The supply of this metal from domestic U.S. mines and mills can be represented by the equation Q
S /H11005 2/3 P, where QS is U.S. output in 
million ounces and P is the domestic price. The demand 
for the metal in the United States is QD /H11005 40 − 2 P, where 
QD is the domestic demand in million ounces.
In recent years the U.S. industry has been protected 
by a tariff of $9 per ounce. Under pressure from other foreign governments, the United States plans to reduce this tariff to zero. Threatened by this change, the U.S. industry is seeking a voluntary restraint agreement that would limit imports into the United States to 8 million ounces per year.
 a. Under the $9 tariff, what was the U.S. domestic 
price of the metal?
 b. If the United States eliminates the tariff and the vol-
untary restraint agreement is approved, what will be the U.S. domestic price of the metal?
 9. Among the tax proposals regularly considered by 
Congress is an additional tax on distilled liquors. The tax would not apply to beer. The price elasticity of sup-ply of liquor is 4.0, and the price elasticity of demand is −0.2. The cross-elasticity of demand for beer with respect to the price of liquor is 0.1.
 a. If the new tax is imposed, who will bear the greater 
burden—liquor suppliers or liquor consumers? Why?
 b. Assuming that beer supply is infinitely elastic, how 
will the new tax affect the beer market?
 10. In Example 9.1 (page 322), we calculated the gains and 
losses from price controls on natural gas and found that there was a deadweight loss of $5.68 billion. This calculation was based on a price of oil of $50 per barrel.
 a. If the price of oil were $60 per barrel, what would 
be the free-market price of gas? How large a dead-weight loss would result if the maximum allowable price of natural gas were $3.00 per thousand cubic feet?
 b. What price of oil would yield a free-market price of 
natural gas of $3?
 11. Example 9.6 (page 342) describes the effects of the 
sugar quota. In 2011, imports were limited to 6.9 bil-lion pounds, which pushed the domestic price to 36 Part 3 examines a broad range of markets and explains 
how the pricing, investment, and output decisions of firms depend on market structure and the behavior of competitors.
Chapters 10 and 11 examine market power : the ability to affect 
price, either by a seller or a buyer. We will see how market power arises, how it differs across firms, how it affects the welfare of con-sumers and producers, and how it can be limited by government. We will also see how firms can design pricing and advertising  strategies to take maximum advantage of their market power.
Chapters 12 and 13 deal with markets in which the number of 
firms is limited. We will examine a variety of such markets, ranging from monopolistic competition , in which many firms sell differenti-
ated products, to a cartel , in which a group of firms coordinates 
decisions and acts as a monopolist. We are particularly concerned with markets in which there are only a few firms. In these cases, each firm must design its pricing, output, and investment strate-gies, while keeping in mind how competitors are likely to react. We will develop and apply principles from game theory to analyze such strategies.
Chapter 14 shows how markets for factor inputs, such as labor 
and raw materials, operate. We will examine the firm’s input  decisions and show how those decisions depend on the structure of the input market. Chapter 15 then focuses on capital invest-ment decisions. We will see how a firm can value the future profits that it expects an investment to yield and then compare this value with the cost of the investment to determine whether the invest-ment is worthwhile. We will also apply this idea to the decisions of  individuals to purchase a car or household appliance, or to invest in education.10

In a perfectly competitive market, the large number of sellers and buy-
ers of a good ensures that no single seller or buyer can affect its price. The market forces of supply and demand determine price. Individual 
firms take the market price as a given in deciding how much to produce and sell, and consumers take it as a given in deciding how much to buy.
Monopoly  and monopsony , the subjects of this chapter, are the polar 
opposites of perfect competition. A monopoly  is a market that has only 
one seller but many buyers. A monopsony  is just the opposite: a mar-
ket with many sellers but only one buyer. Monopoly and monopsony are closely related, which is why we cover them in the same chapter.
First we discuss the behavior of a monopolist. Because a monopo-
list is the sole producer of a product, the demand curve that it faces is the market demand curve. This market demand curve relates the price that the monopolist receives to the quantity it offers for sale. We will see how a monopolist can take advantage of its control over price and how the profit-maximizing price and quantity differ from what would prevail in a competitive market.
In general, the monopolist’s quantity will be lower and its price 
higher than the competitive quantity and price. This imposes a cost on society because fewer consumers buy the product, and those who do pay more for it. This is why antitrust laws exist which forbid firms from monopolizing most markets. When economies of scale make monopoly desirable—for example, with local electric power compa-nies—we will see how the government can increase efficiency by regu-lating the monopolist’s price.
Pure monopoly  is rare, but in many markets only a few firms compete 
with each other. The interactions of firms in such markets can be com-plicated and often involve aspects of strategic gaming , a topic covered 
in Chapters 12 and 13. In any case, the firms may be able to affect price and may find it profitable to charge a price higher than marginal cost. These firms have monopoly power.  We will discuss the determinants of 
monopoly power, its measurement, and its implications for pricing.
Next we will turn to monopsony.  Unlike a competitive buyer, 
a monopsonist pays a price that depends on the quantity that it  purchases. The monopsonist’s problem is to choose the quantity that 10.1

maximizes its net benefit from the purchase—the value derived from the good 
less the money paid for it. By showing how the choice is made, we will demon-strate the close parallel between monopsony and monopoly.
Although pure monopsony is also unusual, many markets have only a few 
buyers who can purchase the good for less than they would pay in a competi-tive market. These buyers have monopsony power.  Typically, this situation occurs 
in markets for inputs to production. For example, General Motors, the largest U.S. car manufacturer, has monopsony power in the markets for tires, car batter-ies, and other parts. We will discuss the determinants of monopsony power, its  measurement, and its implications for pricing.
Monopoly and monopsony power are two forms of market power:  the 
 ability—of either a seller or a buyer—to affect the price of a good.
1 Because 
 sellers or buyers often have at least some market power (in most real-world markets), we need to understand how market power works and how it affects producers and consumers.
10.1  Monopoly
As the sole producer of a product, a monopolist is in a unique position. If the monopolist decides to raise the price of the product, it need not worry about competitors who, by charging lower prices, would capture a larger share of the market at the monopolist’s expense. The monopolist is the market and com-
pletely controls the amount of output offered for sale.
But this does not mean that the monopolist can charge any price it wants—at 
least not if its objective is to maximize profit. This textbook is a case in point. Pearson Prentice Hall owns the copyright and is therefore a monopoly producer of this book. So why doesn’t it sell the book for $500 a copy? Because few people would buy it, and Prentice Hall would earn a much lower profit.
To maximize profit, the monopolist must first determine its costs and the 
characteristics of market demand. Knowledge of demand and cost is crucial for a firm’s economic decision making. Given this knowledge, the monopolist must then decide how much to produce and sell. The price per unit that the monopo-list receives then follows directly from the market demand curve. Equivalently, the monopolist can determine price, and the quantity it will sell at that price  follows from the market demand curve.
Average Revenue and Marginal Revenue
The monopolist’s average revenue —the price it receives per unit sold—is precisely 
the market demand curve. To choose its profit-maximizing output level, the monopolist also needs to know its marginal revenue:  the change in revenue that 
results from a unit change in output. To see the relationship among total, aver-age, and marginal revenue, consider a firm facing the following demand curve:
P=6-Q
Table 10.1 shows the behavior of total, average, and marginal revenue for 
this demand curve. Note that revenue is zero when the price is $6: At that price,  nothing is sold. At a price of $5, however, one unit is sold, so total (and • market power  Ability of a

In §8.3, we explain that marginal revenue is a mea-sure of how much revenue increases when output increases by one unit.• monopoly

• monopsony  Market with

1The courts use the term “monopoly power” to mean significant and sustainable market power, suf-
ficient to warrant particular scrutiny under the antitrust laws. In this book, however, for pedagogic reasons we use “monopoly power” differently, to mean market power on the part of sellers, whether substantial or not.CHAPTER 10   •  Market Power: Monopoly and Monopsony  359
 marginal) revenue is $5. An increase in quantity sold from 1 to 2 increases reve-
nue from $5 to $8; marginal revenue is thus $3. As quantity sold increases from 2 to 3,  marginal revenue falls to $1, and when quantity increases from 3 to 4, mar-ginal revenue becomes negative. When marginal revenue is positive, revenue is increasing with quantity, but when marginal revenue is negative, revenue is decreasing.
When the demand curve is downward sloping, the price (average revenue) 
is greater than marginal revenue because all units are sold at the same price. If sales are to increase by 1 unit, the price must fall. In that case, all units sold, not just the additional unit, will earn less revenue. Note, for example, what happens in Table 10.1 when output is increased from 1 to 2 units and price is reduced to $4. Marginal revenue is $3: $4 (the revenue from the sale of the additional unit of output) less $1 (the loss of revenue from selling the first unit for $4 instead of $5). Thus, marginal revenue ($3) is less than price ($4).
Figure 10.1 plots average and marginal revenue for the data in Table 10.1. Our 
demand curve is a straight line and, in this case, the marginal  revenue curve has twice the slope of the demand curve (and the same  intercept).
2
The Monopolist’s Output Decision
What quantity should the monopolist produce? In Chapter 8, we saw that to maximize profit, a firm must set output so that marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost. This is the solution to the monopolist’s problem. In Figure 10.2, the market demand curve D is the monopolist’s average revenue curve. It speci-
fies the price per unit that the monopolist receives as a function of its output level. Also shown are the corresponding marginal revenue curve MR and the average and marginal cost curves, AC and MC. Marginal revenue and marginal cost are equal at quantity Q*. Then from the demand curve, we find the price P* 
that corresponds to this quantity Q*.
How can we be sure that Q* is the profit-maximizing quantity? Suppose the 
monopolist produces a smaller quantity Q
1 and receives the corresponding 
higher price P1. As Figure 10.2 shows, marginal revenue would then exceed 
marginal cost. In that case, if the monopolist produced a little more than Q1, In §7.1, we explain that 
marginal cost is the change in variable cost associated with a one-unit increase in output.TABLE 10.1 TOTAL, MARGINAL, AND AVERAGE REVENUE

2If the demand curve is written so that price is a function of quantity, P /H11005 a − bQ, total revenue is 
given by PQ /H11005 aQ − bQ2. Marginal revenue (using calculus) is d(PQ)/dQ /H11005 a − 2bQ. In this example, 
demand is P /H11005 6 − Q and marginal revenue is MR /H11005 6 − 2 Q. (This holds only for small changes in Q 
and therefore does not exactly match the data in Table 10.1.)360  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
it would receive extra profit (MR − MC) and thereby increase its total profit. 
In fact, the monopolist could keep increasing output, adding more to its total profit until output Q*, at which point the incremental profit earned from 
 producing one more unit is zero. So the smaller quantity Q
1 is not profit maxi-
mizing, even though it allows the monopolist to charge a higher price. If the monopolist produced Q
1 instead of Q*, its total profit would be smaller by an 
amount equal to the shaded area below the MR curve and above the MC curve, between Q
1 and Q*.
In Figure 10.2, the larger quantity Q2 is likewise not profit maximizing. 
At this quantity, marginal cost exceeds marginal revenue. Therefore, if the monopolist produced a little less than Q
2, it would increase its total profit 
(by MC − MR). It could increase its profit even more by reducing output all the way to Q*. The increased profit achieved by producing Q* instead of Q
2 
is given by the area below the MC curve and above the MR curve, between Q* and Q
2.
We can also see algebraically that Q* maximizes profit. Profit p is the differ-
ence between revenue and cost, both of which depend on Q:
p(Q)=R(Q)-C(Q)
As Q is increased from zero, profit will increase until it reaches a maxi-
mum and then begin to decrease. Thus the profit-maximizing Q is such that 
the incremental profit resulting from a small increase in Q is just zero (i.e., 
/H9004p>/H9004Q=0 ).Then
/H9004p//H9004Q=/H9004R//H9004Q-/H9004C//H9004Q=0
But /H9004R>/H9004Q is marginal revenue and /H9004C>/H9004Q is marginal cost. Thus the 
profit-maximizing condition is that MR -MC=0, or MR =MC.Dollars per

An Example
To grasp this result more clearly, let’s look at an example. Suppose the cost of 
production is
C(Q)=50+Q2
In other words, there is a fixed cost of $50, and variable cost is Q2. Suppose 
demand is given by
P(Q)=40-Q
By setting marginal revenue equal to marginal cost, you can verify that 
profit is maximized when Q=10, an output level that corresponds to a price 
of $30.3Price

Q* is the output level at which MR /H11005 MC. If the firm produces a smaller output—say, Q1—it sacri-
fices some profit because the extra revenue that could be earned from producing and selling the units between Q
1 and Q* exceeds the cost of producing them. Similarly, expanding output from 
Q* to Q2 would reduce profit because the additional cost would exceed the additional revenue.
3Note that average cost is C(Q)/Q /H11005 50/Q /H11001 Q and marginal cost is /H9004C//H9004Q /H11005 2Q. Revenue is R(Q) /H11005 
P(Q)Q /H11005 40Q − Q2, so marginal revenue is MR /H11005 /H9004R//H9004Q /H11005 40 − 2 Q. Setting marginal revenue equal 
to marginal cost gives 40 − 2 Q /H11005 2Q, or Q /H11005 10.362  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
Cost, revenue, and profit are plotted in Figure 10.3(a). When the firm pro-
duces little or no output, profit is negative because of the fixed cost. Profit increases as Q increases, reaching a maximum of $150 at Q*=10, and then 
decreases as Q is increased further. At the point of maximum profit, the slopes 
of the revenue and cost curves are the same. (Note that the tangent lines rr’ and 
cc’ are parallel.) The slope of the revenue curve is /H9004R>/H9004Q, or marginal revenue, 
and the slope of the cost curve is 
/H9004C>/H9004Q, or marginal cost. Because profit is 
maximized when marginal revenue equals marginal cost, the slopes are equal.
Figure 10.3(b) shows both the corresponding average and marginal revenue 
curves and average and marginal cost curves. Marginal revenue and marginal cost intersect at Q*=10. At this quantity, average cost is $15 per unit and price 
is $30 per unit. Thus average profit is $30 -$15=$15 per unit. Because 10 
units are sold, profit is (10)($15)

marginal revenue equals marginal cost. At this output level, the slope of the profit curve is zero, and the slopes of the total revenue and total cost curves are equal. The profit per unit is $15, the difference between average revenue and aver-age cost. Because 10 units are produced, total profit is $150.CHAPTER 10   •  Market Power: Monopoly and Monopsony  363
A Rule of Thumb for Pricing
We know that price and output should be chosen so that marginal revenue 
equals marginal cost, but how can the manager of a firm find the correct price and output level in practice? Most managers have only limited knowledge of the average and marginal revenue curves that their firms face. Similarly, they might know the firm’s marginal cost only over a limited output range. We there-fore want to translate the condition that marginal revenue should equal mar-ginal cost into a rule of thumb that can be more easily applied in practice.
To do this, we first write the expression for marginal revenue:
MR= /H9004R
/H9004Q = /H9004(PQ)
/H9004Q
Note that the extra revenue from an incremental unit of quantity, /H90041PQ2>/H9004Q, 
has two components:
 1. Producing one extra unit and selling it at price P brings in revenue (1)( P) /H11005 P.
 2. But because the firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve, producing 
and selling this extra unit also results in a small drop in price /H9004P>/H9004Q which 
reduces the revenue from all units sold (i.e., a change in revenue Q[/H9004P>/H9004Q]).
Thus,
MR=P+Q /H9004P
/H9004Q =P+Pa Q
P ba /H9004P
/H9004Q b
We obtained the expression on the right by taking the term Q1/H9004P>/H9004Q2 and 
multiplying and dividing it by P. Recall that the elasticity of demand is defined 
as Ed=1P>Q21/H9004Q>/H9004P2. Thus 1Q>P21/H9004P>/H9004Q2 is the reciprocal of the elastic-
ity of demand, 1/ Ed, measured at the profit-maximizing output, and
MR=P+P(1/Ed)
Now, because the firm’s objective is to maximize profit, we can set marginal 
revenue equal to marginal cost:
P+P(1/Ed)=MC
which can be rearranged to give us
 P-MC
P =-1
Ed (10.1)
This relationship provides a rule of thumb for pricing. The left-hand side, 
(P-MC)/ P, is the markup over marginal cost as a percentage of price. The 
relationship says that this markup should equal minus the inverse of the elas-ticity of demand.
4 (This figure will be a positive  number because the elasticity The elasticity of demand is 
discussed in §§2.4 and 4.3.
4Remember that this markup equation applies at the point of a profit maximum. If both the elasticity of 
demand and marginal cost vary considerably over the range of outputs under consideration, you may have to know the entire demand and marginal cost curves to determine the optimum output level. On the other hand, you can use this equation to check whether a particular output level and price are optimal.364  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
of demand is negative. ) Equivalently, we can rearrange this equation to express 
price directly as a markup over marginal cost:
P= MC
1+(1/Ed) (10.2)
For example, if the elasticity of demand is −4 and marginal cost is $9 per unit, 
price should be $9/(1 -1/4)=$9/.75 =$12 per unit.
How does the price set by a monopolist compare with the price under compe-
tition? In Chapter 8, we saw that in a perfectly competitive market, price equals marginal cost. A monopolist charges a price that exceeds marginal cost, but by an 
amount that depends inversely on the elasticity of demand.  As the markup equation 
(10.1) shows, if demand is extremely elastic, E
d is a large negative number, and 
price will be very close to marginal cost. In that case, a monopolized market will look much like a competitive one. In fact, when demand is very elastic, there is little benefit to being a monopolist.
Also note that a monopolist will never produce a quantity of output that is on 
the inelastic portion of the demand curve—i.e., where the elasticity of demand is less than 1 in absolute value. To see why, suppose that the monopolist is pro-ducing at a point on the demand curve where the elasticity is −0.5. In that case, the monopolist could make a greater profit by producing less and selling at a higher price. (A 10-percent reduction in output, for example, would allow for a 20-percent increase in price and thus a 10-percent increase in revenue. If marginal cost were greater than zero, the increase in profit would be even more than 10 percent because the lower output would reduce the firm’s costs.) As the monopo-list reduces output and raises price, it will move up the demand curve to a point where the elasticity is greater than 1 in absolute value and the markup rule of equation (10.2) will be satisfied.
Suppose, however, that marginal cost is zero. In that case, we cannot use 
equation (10.2) directly to determine the profit-maximizing price. However, we can see from equation (10.1) that in order to maximize profit, the firm will pro-duce at the point where the elasticity of demand is exactly −1. If marginal cost is zero, maximizing profit is equivalent to maximizing revenue, and revenue is maximized when E
d=-1.In §8.1, we explain that a 
perfectly competitive firm will choose its output so that marginal cost equals price.
In §4.3 and Table 4.3, we explain that when price is increased, expenditure—and thus revenue—increases if demand is inelastic, decreases if demand is elastic, and is unchanged if demand has unit elasticity.
EXAMPLE 10.1  ASTRA-MERCK PRICES PRILOSEC
In 1995, a new drug developed 
by Astra-Merck became avail-able for the long-term treatment of ulcers. The drug, Prilosec, represented a new generation of antiulcer medication. Other drugs to treat ulcer conditions were already on the market: Tagamet had been introduced in 1977, Zantac in 1983, Pepcid 
in 1986, and Axid in 1988. These four drugs worked in much the same way to reduce the stom-ach’s secretion of acid. Prilosec, however, was based on a very different biochemical mecha-nism and was much more effec-tive than these earlier drugs. By 
CHAPTER 10   •  Market Power: Monopoly and Monopsony  365
Shifts in Demand
In a competitive market, there is a clear relationship between price and the quan-
tity supplied. That relationship is the supply curve , which, as we saw in Chapter 8, 
represents the marginal cost of production for the industry as a whole. The sup-ply curve tells us how much will be produced at every price.
A monopolistic market has no supply curve.  In other words, there is no one-to-one 
relationship between price and the quantity produced.  The reason is that the monopo-
list’s output decision depends not only on marginal cost but also on the shape of the demand curve. As a result, shifts in demand do not trace out the series of prices and quantities that correspond to a competitive supply curve. Instead, shifts in demand can lead to changes in price with no change in output, changes in output with no change in price, or changes in both price and output.
This principle is illustrated in Figure 10.4(a) and (b). In both parts of the 
 figure, the demand curve is initially D
1, the corresponding marginal revenue 
curve is MR1, and the monopolist’s initial price and quantity are P1 and Q1. In 
Figure 10.4(a), the demand curve is shifted down and rotated. The new demand and marginal revenue curves are shown as D
2 and MR2. Note that MR2 intersects 
the marginal cost curve at the same point that MR1 does. As a result, the quan-
tity produced stays the same. Price, however, falls to P2.
In Figure 10.4(b), the demand curve is shifted up and rotated. The new mar-
ginal revenue curve MR2 intersects the marginal cost curve at a larger quantity, 
Q2 instead of Q1. But the shift in the demand curve is such that the price charged 
is exactly the same.
Shifts in demand usually cause changes in both price and quantity. But the 
special cases shown in Figure 10.4 illustrate an important distinction between monopoly and competitive supply. A competitive industry supplies a specific quantity at every price. No such relationship exists for a monopolist, which, depending on how demand shifts, might supply several different quantities at the same price, or the same quantity at different prices.1996, it had become the best-selling drug in the world and faced no major competitor.

In 1995, Astra-Merck was pricing Prilosec at about 
$3.50 per daily dose. (By contrast, the prices for Tagamet and Zantac were about $1.50 to $2.25 per daily dose.) Is this pricing consistent with the markup formula (10.1)? The marginal cost of producing and packaging Prilosec is only about 30 to 40 cents per daily dose. This low marginal cost implies that 
the price elasticity of demand, E
D, should be in the 
range of roughly −1.0 to −1.2. Based on statistical studies of pharmaceutical demand, this is indeed a reasonable estimate for the demand elasticity. Thus, setting the price of Prilosec at a markup exceeding  
400 percent over marginal cost is consistent with our rule of thumb for pricing.
5Prilosec, developed through a joint venture of the Swedish firm Astra and the U.S. firm Merck, 
was introduced in 1989, but only for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease, and was approved for short-term ulcer treatment in 1991. It was the approval for long-term ulcer treat-ment in 1995, however, that created a very large market for the drug. In 1998, Astra bought Merck’s share of the rights to Prilosec. In 1999, Astra acquired the firm Zeneca and is now called AstraZeneca. In 2001, AstraZeneca earned over $4.9 billion in sales of Prilosec, which remained the world’s best-selling prescription drug. As AstraZeneca’s patent on Prilosec neared expiration, the company introduced Nexium, a new (and, according to the company, better) antiulcer drug. In 2006, Nexium was the third-biggest-selling pharmaceutical drug in the world, with sales of about $5.7 billion.366  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
The Effect of a Tax
A tax on output can also have a different effect on a monopolist than on a com-
petitive industry. In Chapter 9, we saw that when a specific (i.e., per-unit) tax is imposed on a competitive industry, the market price rises by an amount that is less than the tax, and that the burden of the tax is shared by producers and consumers. Under monopoly, however, price can sometimes rise by more  than 
the amount of the tax.
Analyzing the effect of a tax on a monopolist is straightforward. Suppose 
a specific tax of t dollars per unit is levied, so that the monopolist must remit 
t dollars to the government for every unit it sells. Therefore, the firm’s mar-
ginal (and average) cost is increased by the amount of the tax t. If MC was 
the firm’s original marginal cost, its optimal production decision is now given by
MR=MC +t
Graphically, we shift the marginal cost curve upward by an amount t, and 
find the new intersection with marginal revenue. Figure 10.5 shows this. Here Q
0 and P0 are the quantity and price before the tax is imposed, and Q1 and P1 are 
the quantity and price after the tax.In §9.6, we explain that 
a specific tax is a tax of a certain amount of money per unit sold, and we show how the tax affects price and quantity.
In §8.2, we explain that a firm maximizes its profit by choosing the output at which marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost.P1

SHIFTS IN DEMAND
Shifting the demand curve shows that a monopolistic market has no supply curve—i.e., there is no 
one-to-one relationship between price and quantity produced. In (a), the demand curve D1 shifts 
to new demand curve D2. But the new marginal revenue curve MR2 intersects marginal cost at the 
same point as the old marginal revenue curve MR1. The profit-maximizing output therefore remains 
the same, although price falls from P1 to P2. In (b), the new marginal revenue curve MR2 intersects 
marginal cost at a higher output level Q2. But because demand is now more elastic, price remains 
the same.CHAPTER 10   •  Market Power: Monopoly and Monopsony  367
Shifting the marginal cost curve upward results in a smaller quantity and 
higher price. Sometimes price increases by less than the tax, but not always—in Figure 10.5, price increases by more  than the tax. This would be impossible in 
a competitive market, but it can happen with a monopolist because the rela-tionship between price and marginal cost depends on the elasticity of demand. Suppose, for example, that a monopolist faces a constant elasticity demand curve, with elasticity −2, and has constant marginal cost MC. Equation (10.2) then tells us that price will equal twice marginal cost. With a tax t, marginal cost 
increases to MC /H11001 t, so price increases to 2(MC /H11001 t) /H11005 2MC /H11001 2t; that is, it rises 
by twice the amount of the tax. (However, the monopolist’s profit nonetheless falls with the tax.)
*The Multiplant Firm
We have seen that a firm maximizes profit by setting output at a level where mar-ginal revenue equals marginal cost. For many firms, production takes place in two or more different plants whose operating costs can differ. However, the logic used in choosing output levels is very similar to that for the single-plant firm.
Suppose a firm has two plants. What should its total output be, and how 
much of that output should each plant produce? We can find the answer intui-tively in two steps.
• Step 1.  Whatever the total output, it should be divided between the two plants 
so that marginal cost is the same in each plant.  Otherwise, the firm could reduce its 
costs and increase its profit by reallocating production. For example, if margin-al cost at Plant 1 were higher than at Plant 2, the firm could produce the same output at a lower total cost by producing less at Plant 1 and more at Plant 2.
• Step 2.  We know that total output must be such that marginal revenue equals mar-
ginal cost.  Otherwise, the firm could increase its profit by raising or lowering 
 total output. For example, suppose marginal costs were the same at each plant, but marginal revenue exceeded marginal cost. In that case, the firm would do better by producing more at both plants because the revenue earned from the $/Q

EFFECT OF EXCISE TAX  
ON MONOPOLIST
With a tax t per unit, the firm’s effective 
marginal cost is increased by the amount t 
to MC /H11001 t. In this example, the increase in 
price /H9004P is larger than the tax t.368  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
additional units would exceed the cost. Because marginal costs must be the same 
at each plant, and because marginal revenue must equal marginal cost, we see that profit is maximized when marginal revenue equals marginal cost at each plant.
We can also derive this result algebraically. Let Q
1 and C1 be the output and 
cost of production for Plant 1, Q2 and C2 be the output and cost of production for 
Plant 2, and QT=Q1+Q2 be total output. Then profit is
p =PQ T-C1(Q1)-C2(Q2)
The firm should increase output from each plant until the incremental profit 
from the last unit produced is zero. Start by setting incremental profit from  output at Plant 1 to zero:
/H9004p 
/H9004Q1=/H9004(PQ T)
/H9004Q1-/H9004C1
/H9004Q1=0
Here /H9004(PQT)//H9004Q1 is the revenue from producing and selling one more unit—
i.e., marginal revenue , MR, for all of the firm’s output. The next term, /H9004C1//H9004Q1, is 
marginal cost  at Plant 1, MC1. We thus have MR -MC1 /H11005 0, or
MR=MC 1
Similarly, we can set incremental profit from output at Plant 2 to zero,
MR=MC 2
Putting these relations together, we see that the firm should produce so that
 MR =MC 1=MC 2 (10.3)
Figure 10.6 illustrates this principle for a firm with two plants. MC1 and MC2 
are the marginal cost curves for the two plants. (Note that Plant 1 has higher marginal costs than Plant 2.) Also shown is a curve labeled MC
T. This is the 
firm’s total marginal cost and is obtained by horizontally summing MC1 and 
MC2. Now we can find the profit-maximizing output levels Q1, Q2, and QT. First, 
find the intersection of MCT with MR; that point determines total output QT. 
Next, draw a horizontal line from that point on the marginal revenue curve to the vertical axis; point MR* determines the firm’s marginal revenue. The inter-sections of the marginal revenue line with MC
1 and MC2 give the outputs Q1 and 
Q2 for the two plants, as in equation (10.3).
Note that total output QT determines the firm’s marginal revenue (and hence 
its price P*). Q1 and Q2, however, determine marginal costs at each of the two 
plants. Because MCT was found by horizontally summing MC1 and MC2, we 
know that Q1+Q2=QT. Thus these output levels satisfy the condition that 
MR=MC1=MC2.
10.2  Monopoly Power
Pure monopoly is rare. Markets in which several firms compete with one another 
are much more common. We say more about the forms that this competition can take in Chapters 12 and 13. But we should explain here why each firm in a Note the similarity to 
the way we obtained a  competitive industry’s supply 
curve in §8.5 by horizontally summing the marginal cost curves of the individual firms.CHAPTER 10   •  Market Power: Monopoly and Monopsony  369
 market with several firms is likely to face a downward-sloping demand curve 
and, as a result, to produce so that price exceeds marginal cost.
Suppose, for example, that four firms produce toothbrushes and have the 
market demand curve Q /H11005 50,000 − 20,000 P, as shown in Figure 10.7(a). Let’s 
assume that these four firms are producing an aggregate of 20,000 toothbrushes per day (5000 each per day) and selling them at $1.50 each. Note that market demand is relatively inelastic; you can verify that at this $1.50 price, the elastic-ity of demand is −1.5.
Now suppose that Firm A is deciding whether to lower its price to increase 
sales. To make this decision, it needs to know how its sales would respond to a change in its price. In other words, it needs some idea of the demand curve it 
faces, as opposed to the market  demand curve. A reasonable possibility is shown 
in Figure 10.7(b), where the firm’s demand curve D
A is much more elastic than the 
market demand curve. (At the $1.50 price the elasticity is −6.0.) The firm might predict that by raising the price from $1.50 to $1.60, its sales will drop—say, from 5000 units to 3000—as consumers buy more toothbrushes from other firms. (If all firms raised their prices to $1.60, sales for Firm A would fall only to 4500.) For 
several reasons, sales won’t drop to zero as they would in a perfectly competitive market. First, if Firm A’s toothbrushes are a little different from those of its com-
petitors, some consumers will pay a bit more for them. Second, other firms might also raise their prices. Similarly, Firm A might anticipate that by lowering its price 
from $1.50 to $1.40, it can sell more toothbrushes—perhaps 7000 instead of 5000. But it will not capture the entire market: Some consumers might still prefer the competitors’ toothbrushes, and competitors might also lower their prices.
Thus, Firm A’s demand curve depends both on how much its product  differs 
from its competitors’ products and on how the four firms compete with one another. We will discuss product differentiation and interfirm competition in Chapters 12 and 13. But one important point should be clear: Firm A is likely to 
face a demand curve which is more elastic than the market demand curve, but which is not infinitely elastic like the demand curve facing a perfectly competitive firm.$/Q

7See Example 12.1.EXAMPLE 10.2  ELASTICITIES OF DEMAND FOR SOFT DRINKS
Soft drinks provide a good example of the differ-
ence between a market elasticity of demand  and a 
firm’s elasticity of demand.  In addition, soft drinks 
are important because their consumption has been linked to childhood obesity; there could be health benefits from taxing them.
A recent review of several statistical stud-
ies found that the market elasticity of demand for soft drinks is between −0.8 and −1.0.
6 That 
means that if all soft drink producers increased 
the prices of all of their brands by 1 percent, the quantity of soft drinks demanded would fall by 0.8 to 1.0 percent.The demand for any individual soft drink, however, 
will be much more elastic, because consumers can readily substitute one drink for another. Although elasticities will differ across different brands, studies have shown that the elasticity of demand for, say, Coca Cola is around −5.
7 In other words, if the price 
of Coke were increased by 1 percent but the prices of all other soft drinks remained unchanged, the quan-tity of Coke demanded would fall by about 5 percent.
Students—and business people—sometimes 
confuse the market elasticity of demand with the firm (or brand) elasticity of demand. Make sure you understand the difference.CHAPTER 10   •  Market Power: Monopoly and Monopsony  371
Production, Price, and Monopoly Power
As we will see in Chapters 12 and 13, determining the elasticity of demand for a 
firm’s product is usually more difficult than determining the market elasticity of demand. Nonetheless, firms will often use market research and statistical stud-ies to estimate elasticities of demand for their products, because knowledge of these elasticities can be essential for profit-maximizing production and pricing decisions.
Let’s return to the demand for toothbrushes in Figure 10.7. Let’s assume 
that Firm A in that figure has a good knowledge of its demand curve. In that 
case, how much should Firm A produce? The same principle applies: The 
profit-maximizing quantity equates marginal revenue and marginal cost. In Figure 10.7(b), that quantity is 5000 units. The corresponding price is $1.50, which exceeds marginal cost. Thus, although Firm A is not a pure monopo-
list, it does have monopoly power —it can profitably charge a price greater than 
marginal cost. Of course, its monopoly power is less than it would be if it had driven away the competition and monopolized the market, but it might still be substantial.
This raises two questions.
 1. How can we measure  monopoly power in order to compare one firm with 
another? (So far we have been talking about monopoly power only in quali-
tative  terms.)
 2. What are the sources  of monopoly power, and why do some firms have 
more monopoly power than others?
We address both these questions below, although a more complete answer to 
the second question will be provided in Chapters 12 and 13.
Measuring Monopoly Power
Remember the important distinction between a perfectly competitive firm and a firm with monopoly power: For the competitive firm, price equals marginal cost; 
for the firm with monopoly power, price exceeds marginal cost.  Therefore, a natural 
way to measure monopoly power is to examine the extent to which the profit-maximizing price exceeds marginal cost. In particular, we can use the markup ratio of price minus marginal cost to price that we introduced earlier as part of a rule of thumb for pricing. This measure of monopoly power, introduced by economist Abba Lerner in 1934, is called the Lerner Index of Monopoly 
Power.  It is the difference between price and marginal cost, divided by price. 
Mathematically:
L=(P-MC)/ P
The Lerner index always has a value between zero and one. For a perfectly com-
petitive firm, P /H11005 MC, so that L /H11005 0. The larger is L, the greater is the degree of 
monopoly power.
This index of monopoly power can also be expressed in terms of the elasticity 
of demand facing the firm. Using equation (10.1), we know that
 L=(P-MC)/ P=-1/E
d (10.4)
Remember, however, that Ed is now the elasticity of the firm’s  demand curve, not 
the market demand curve. In the toothbrush example discussed previously, the • Lerner Index of Monopoly 
Power  Measure of monopoly 
power calculated as excess of price over marginal cost as a fraction of price.372  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
elasticity of demand for Firm A is −6.0, and the degree of monopoly power is 
1/6 /H11005 0.167.8
Note that considerable monopoly power does not necessarily imply high 
profits. Profit depends on average  cost relative to price. Firm A might have more 
monopoly power than Firm B but earn a lower profit because of higher average 
costs.
The Rule of Thumb for Pricing
In the previous section, we used equation (10.2) to compute price as a simple markup over marginal cost:
P=MC
1+(1/Ed)
This relationship provides a rule of thumb for any firm with monopoly power. 
We must remember, however, that Ed is the elasticity of demand for the firm, not 
the elasticity of market  demand.
It is harder to determine the elasticity of demand for the firm than for the 
market because the firm must consider how its competitors will react to price changes. Essentially, the manager must estimate the percentage change in the firm’s unit sales that is likely to result from a 1-percent change in the firm’s price. This estimate might be based on a formal model or on the manager’s intu-ition and experience.
Given an estimate of the firm’s elasticity of demand, the manager can calcu-
late the proper markup. If the firm’s elasticity of demand is large, this markup will be small (and we can say that the firm has very little monopoly power). If the firm’s elasticity of demand is small, this markup will be large (and the firm will have considerable monopoly power). Figures 10.8(a) and 10.8(b) illustrate these two extremes.
EXAMPLE 10.3  MARKUP PRICING: SUPERMARKETS TO DESIGNER JEANS
Three examples should help clarify the use of markup pricing. Consider a supermarket chain. Although the elasticity of market demand for food is small (about −1), several supermarkets usually serve most areas. Thus no single supermar-ket can raise its prices very much without  losing customers to other stores. As a result, the elasticity 
of demand for any one super-market is often as large as -10. 
Substituting this number for E
d in 
equation (10.2), we find P=MC>
(1/H110020.1)/H11005MC>(0.9) /H11005(1.11) MC. In 
other words, the manager of a typ-ical supermarket should set prices about 11 percent above marginal 
8There are three problems with applying the Lerner index to the analysis of public policy toward 
firms. First, because marginal cost is difficult to measure, average variable cost is often used in Lerner index calculations. Second, if the firm prices below its optimal price (possibly to avoid legal scrutiny), its potential monopoly power will not be noted by the index. Third, the index ignores dynamic aspects of pricing such as effects of the learning curve and shifts in demand. See Robert S. Pindyck, “The Measurement of Monopoly Power in Dynamic Markets,” Journal of Law and Economics  
28 (April 1985): 193–222.CHAPTER 10   •  Market Power: Monopoly and Monopsony  373
cost. For a  reasonably wide range of output levels 
(over which the size of the store and the number of its employees will remain fixed), marginal cost includes the cost of purchasing the food at wholesale, plus the costs of storing the food, arranging it on the shelves, etc. For most supermarkets, the markup is indeed about 10 or 11 percent.
Small convenience stores, which are often open 
7 days a week and even 24 hours a day, typically charge higher prices than supermarkets. Why? Because a convenience store faces a less elastic demand curve. Its customers are generally less price sensitive. They might need a quart of milk or a loaf of bread late at night or may find it inconvenient to drive to the supermarket. Because the elasticity of demand for a convenience store is about −5, the markup equation implies that its prices should be about 25 percent above marginal cost, as indeed they typically are.
The Lerner index, ( P − MC)/ P, tells us that the 
convenience store has more monopoly power, but does it make larger profits? No. Because its volume is far smaller and its average fixed costs are larger, 
it usually earns a much smaller profit than a large supermarket despite its higher markup.
Finally, consider a producer of designer jeans. 
Many companies produce jeans, but some consum-ers will pay much more for jeans with a designer label. Just how much more they will pay—or more exactly, how much sales will drop in response to higher prices—is a question that the producer must carefully consider because it is critical in determin-ing the price at which the clothing will be sold (at wholesale to retail stores, which then mark up the price further). With designer jeans, demand elas-ticities in the range of −2 to −3 are typical for the major labels. This means that price should be 50 to 100 percent higher than marginal cost. Marginal cost is typically $20 to $25 per pair, and depend-ing on the brand, the wholesale price is in the $30 to $50 range. In contrast, “mass-market” jeans will typically wholesale for $18 to $25 per pair. Why? Because without the designer label, they are far more price elastic.

ELASTICITY OF DEMAND AND PRICE MARKUP
The markup ( P − MC)/ P is equal to minus the inverse of the elasticity of demand facing the firm. If the firm’s 
demand is elastic, as in (a), the markup is small and the firm has little monopoly power. The opposite is true 
if demand is relatively inelastic, as in (b).374  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
EXAMPLE 10.4  THE PRICING OF VIDEOS
During the mid-1980s, the number of households 
owning videocassette recorders (VCRs) grew rap-idly, as did the markets for rentals and sales of prere-corded cassettes. Although at that time many more videocassettes were rented through small retail out-lets than sold outright, the market for sales was large and growing. Producers, however, found it difficult to decide what price to charge for  cassettes. As a result, 
in 1985 popular movies were selling for vastly differ-ent prices, as you can see from the data in Table 10.2.
Note that while The Empire Strikes Back  was sell-
ing for nearly $80, Star Trek , a film that appealed to 
the same audience and was about as popular, sold for only about $25. These price differences reflected uncertainty and a wide divergence of views on pric-ing by producers. The issue was whether lower prices would induce consumers to buy videocas-settes rather than rent them. Because producers do not share in the retailers’ revenues from rentals, they should charge a low price for cassettes only if that will induce enough consumers to buy them. Because the market was young, producers had no good estimates of the elasticity of demand, so they based prices on hunches or trial and error.
9
As the market matured, however, sales data 
and market research studies put pricing decisions on firmer ground. Those studies strongly indi-
cated that demand was price elastic and that the profit-maximizing price was in the range of $15 to $30. By the 1990s, most producers had lowered prices across the board. When DVDs were first introduced in 1997, the prices of top-selling DVDs were much more uniform. Since that time, prices of popular DVDs have remained fairly  uniform and 
continued to fall. As Table 10.2 shows, by 2007, prices were typically in the range of $20. As a result, video sales steadily increased up until 2004, as shown in Figure 10.9. With the  introduction of 
high- definition (HD) DVDs in 2006, sales of con-
ventional DVDs began to be displaced by the new format.
Note in Figure 10.9 that total dollar sales of DVDs 
(conventional and HD) reached a peak in 2007 and then began falling at a rapid rate. What happened? Full-length movies became increasingly available on television through the “Video On Demand” services of cable and satellite TV providers. Many movies were available for free, and for some, viewers had to pay a fee ranging from $4 to $6. “On Demand” movies, along with streaming video on the Internet, became an increasingly attractive substitute, and displaced DVD sales.

10.3  Sources of Monopoly Power
Why do some firms have considerable monopoly power while other firms have 
little or none? Remember that monopoly power is the ability to set price above marginal cost and that the amount by which price exceeds marginal cost depends inversely on the elasticity of demand facing the firm. As equation (10.4) shows, the less elastic its demand curve, the more monopoly power a firm has.  The ultimate 
determinant of monopoly power is therefore the firm’s elasticity of demand. Thus we should rephrase our question: Why do some firms (e.g., a supermar-ket chain) face demand curves that are more elastic than those faced by others (e.g., a producer of designer clothing)?
Three factors determine a firm’s elasticity of demand.
 1. The elasticity of market demand.  Because the firm’s own demand will be 
at least as elastic as market demand, the elasticity of market demand limits the potential for monopoly power.
 2. The number of firms in the market.  If there are many firms, it is unlikely 
that any one firm will be able to affect price significantly.
 3. The interaction among firms.  Even if only two or three firms are in the 
market, each firm will be unable to profitably raise price very much if the rivalry among them is aggressive, with each firm trying to capture as much of the market as it can.
Let’s examine each of these three determinants of monopoly power.376  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
The Elasticity of Market Demand
If there is only one firm—a pure monopolist—its demand curve is the mar-
ket demand curve. In this case, the firm’s degree of monopoly power depends completely on the elasticity of market demand. More often, however, several firms compete with one another; then the elasticity of market demand sets a lower limit on the magnitude of the elasticity of demand for each firm. Recall our example of the toothbrush producers illustrated in Figure 10.7 (page 370). The market demand for toothbrushes might not be very elastic, but each firm’s demand will be more elastic. (In Figure 10.7, the elasticity of market demand is −1.5, and the elasticity of demand for each firm is −6.) A particular firm’s elasticity depends on how the firms compete with one another. But no matter how they compete, the elasticity of demand for each firm could never become smaller in magnitude than −1.5.
Because the demand for oil is fairly inelastic (at least in the short run), OPEC 
could raise oil prices far above marginal production cost during the 1970s and early 1980s. Because the demands for such commodities as coffee, cocoa, tin, and copper are much more elastic, attempts by producers to cartelize these mar-kets and raise prices have largely failed. In each case, the elasticity of market demand limits the potential monopoly power of individual producers.
The Number of Firms
The second determinant of a firm’s demand curve—and thus of its monopoly power—is the number of firms in its market. Other things being equal, the monopoly power of each firm will fall as the number of firms increases: As more and more firms compete, each firm will find it harder to raise prices and avoid losing sales to other firms.
What matters, of course, is not just the total number of firms, but the number 
of “major players”—firms with significant market share. For example, if only two large firms account for 90 percent of sales in a market, with another 20 firms accounting for the remaining 10 percent, the two large firms might have consid-erable monopoly power. When only a few firms account for most of the sales in a market, we say that the market is highly concentrated.
10
It is sometimes said (not always jokingly) that the greatest fear of American 
business is competition. That may or may not be true. But we would certainly expect that when only a few firms are in a market, their managers will prefer that no new firms enter. An increase in the number of firms can only reduce the monopoly power of each incumbent firm. An important aspect of competitive strategy (discussed in detail in Chapter 13) is finding ways to create barriers to 
entry —conditions that deter entry by new competitors.
Sometimes there are natural barriers to entry. For example, one firm may have 
a patent  on the technology needed to produce a particular product. This makes 
it impossible for other firms to enter the market, at least until the patent expires. Other legally created rights work in the same way—a copyright  can limit the sale 
of a book, music, or a computer software program to a single company, and the need for a government license  can prevent new firms from entering the markets 
for telephone service, television broadcasting, or interstate trucking. Finally, economies of scale  may make it too costly for more than a few firms to supply the • barrier to entry  Condition 
that impedes entry by new competitors.
10A statistic called the concentration ratio , which measures the percentage of sales accounted for by, 
say, the four largest firms, is often used to describe the concentration of a market. Concentration is one, but not the only, determinant of market power.CHAPTER 10   •  Market Power: Monopoly and Monopsony  377
entire market. In some cases, economies of scale may be so large that it is most 
efficient for a single firm— a natural monopoly —to supply the entire market. We 
will discuss scale economies and natural monopoly in more detail shortly.
The Interaction Among Firms
The ways in which competing firms interact is also an important—and some-times the most important—determinant of monopoly power. Suppose there are four firms in a market. They might compete aggressively, undercutting one another’s prices to capture more market share. This could drive prices down to nearly competitive levels. Each firm will fear that if it raises its price it will be undercut and lose market share. As a result, it will have little monopoly power.
On the other hand, the firms might not compete much. They might even col-
lude (in violation of the antitrust laws), agreeing to limit output and raise prices. Because raising prices in concert rather than individually is more likely to be profitable, collusion can generate substantial monopoly power.
We will discuss the interaction among firms in detail in Chapters 12 and 13. 
Now we simply want to point out that, other things being equal, monopoly power is smaller when firms compete aggressively and is larger when they cooperate.
Remember that a firm’s monopoly power often changes over time, as its 
operating conditions (market demand and cost), its behavior, and the behav-ior of its competitors change. Monopoly power must therefore be thought of in a dynamic context. For example, the market demand curve might be very inelastic in the short run but much more elastic in the long run. (Because this is the case with oil, the OPEC cartel enjoyed considerable short-run but much less long-run monopoly power.) Furthermore, real or potential monopoly power in the short run can make an industry more competitive in the long run: Large short-run profits can induce new firms to enter an industry, thereby reducing monopoly power over the longer term.
10.4  The Social Costs of Monopoly Power
In a competitive market, price equals marginal cost. Monopoly power, on the other hand, implies that price exceeds marginal cost. Because monopoly power results in higher prices and lower quantities produced, we would expect it to make consumers worse off and the firm better off. But suppose we value the welfare of consumers the same as that of producers. In the aggregate, does monopoly power make consumers and producers better or worse off?
We can answer this question by comparing the consumer and producer sur-
plus that results when a competitive industry produces a good with the surplus that results when a monopolist supplies the entire market.
11 (We assume that the 
competitive market and the monopolist have the same cost curves.) Figure 10.10 shows the average and marginal revenue curves and marginal cost curve for the monopolist. To maximize profit, the firm pr oduces at the point where marginal 
revenue equals marginal cost, so that the price and quantity are P
m and Qm. In 
a competitive market, price must equal marginal cost, so the competitive price and quantity, P
c and Qc are found at the intersection of the average revenue 
(demand) curve and the marginal cost curve. Now let’s examine how surplus In §7.4, we explain that a 
firm enjoys economies of scale when it can double its output with less than a dou-bling of cost.
In §9.1, we explain that consumer surplus is the total benefit or value that con-sumers receive beyond what they pay for a good; pro-ducer surplus is the analo-gous measure for producers.
11If there were two or more firms, each with some monopoly power, the analysis would be more 
complex. However, the basic results would be the same.378  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
changes if we move from the competitive price and quantity, Pc and Qc, to the 
monopoly price and quantity, Pm and Qm.
Under monopoly, the price is higher and consumers buy less. Because 
of the higher price, those consumers who buy the good lose surplus of an amount given by rectangle A. Those consumers who do not buy the good at 
price P
m but who would buy at price Pc also lose surplus—namely, an amount 
given by triangle B. The total loss of consumer surplus is therefore A /H11001 B. The 
producer, however, gains rectangle A by selling at the higher price but loses 
triangle C, the additional profit it would have earned by selling Qc − Qm at 
price Pc. The total gain in producer surplus is therefore A − C. Subtracting the 
loss of consumer surplus from the gain in producer surplus, we see a net loss of surplus given by B /H11001 C. This is the deadweight loss from monopoly power.  Even 
if the monopolist’s profits were taxed away and redistributed to the consum-ers of its products, there would be an inefficiency because output would be lower than under conditions of competition. The deadweight loss is the social cost of this inefficiency.
Rent Seeking
In practice, the social cost of monopoly power is likely to exceed the dead-weight loss in triangles B and C of Figure 10.10. The reason is that the firm may 
engage in rent seeking:  spending large amounts of money in socially unpro-
ductive efforts to acquire, maintain, or exercise its monopoly power. Rent seeking might involve lobbying activities (and perhaps campaign contribu-tions) to obtain government regulations that make entry by potential competi-tors more difficult. Rent-seeking activity could also involve advertising and legal efforts to avoid antitrust scrutiny. It might also mean installing but not utilizing extra production capacity to convince potential competitors that they cannot sell enough to make entry worthwhile. We would expect the economic incentive to incur rent-seeking costs to bear a direct relation to the gains from monopoly power (i.e., rectangle A minus triangle C.) Therefore, the larger the • rent seeking  Spending

transfer from consumers to the firm (rectangle A), the larger the social cost of 
monopoly.12
Here’s an example. In 1996, the Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) 
successfully lobbied the Clinton administration for regulations requiring that the ethanol (ethyl alcohol) used in motor vehicle fuel be produced from corn. (The government had already planned to add ethanol to gasoline in order to reduce the country’s dependence on imported oil.) Ethanol is chemically the same whether it is produced from corn, potatoes, grain, or anything else. Then why require that it be produced only from corn? Because ADM had a near monopoly on corn-based ethanol production, so the regulation would increase its gains from monopoly power.
Price Regulation
Because of its social cost, antitrust laws prevent firms from accumulating exces-sive amounts of monopoly power. We will say more about such laws at the end of the chapter. Here, we examine another means by which government can limit monopoly power—price regulation.
We saw in Chapter 9 that in a competitive market, price regulation always 
results in a deadweight loss. This need not be the case, however, when a firm has monopoly power. On the contrary, price regulation can eliminate the dead-weight loss that results from monopoly power.
Figure 10.11 illustrates price regulation. P
m and Qm are the price and quantity 
that result without regulation—i.e., at the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Now suppose the price is regulated to be no higher than P
1. To 
find the firm’s profit-maximizing output, we must determine how its average and marginal revenue curves are affected by the regulation.
Because the firm can charge no more than P
1 for output levels up to Q1, its 
new average revenue curve is a horizontal line at P1. For output levels greater 
than Q1, the new average revenue curve is identical to the old average revenue 
curve: At these output levels, the firm will charge less than P1 and so will be 
unaffected by the regulation.
The firm’s new marginal revenue curve corresponds to its new average rev-
enue curve and is shown by the purple line in Figure 10.11. For output levels up to Q
1, marginal revenue equals average revenue. (Recall that, as with a competi-
tive firm, if average revenue is constant, average revenue and marginal revenue are equal.) For output levels greater than Q
1, the new marginal revenue curve is 
identical to the original curve. Thus the complete marginal revenue curve now has three pieces: (1) the horizontal line at P
1 for quantities up to Q1; (2) a verti-
cal line at the quantity Q1 connecting the original average and marginal revenue 
curves; and (3) the original marginal revenue curve for quantities greater than Q1.
To maximize its profit, the firm should produce the quantity Q1 because that 
is the point at which its marginal revenue curve intersects its marginal cost curve. You can verify that at price P
1 and quantity Q1, the deadweight loss from 
monopoly power is reduced.
As the price is lowered further, the quantity produced continues to increase 
and the deadweight loss to decline. At price Pc where average revenue and mar-
ginal cost intersect, the quantity produced has increased to the competitive level; the deadweight loss from monopoly power has been eliminated. Reducing the 
12The concept of rent seeking was first developed by Gordon Tullock. For more detailed discussions, 
see Gordon Tullock, Rent Seeking  (Brookfield, VT: Edward Elgar, 1993), or Robert D. Tollison and 
Roger D. Congleton, The Economic Analysis of Rent Seeking  (Brookfield, VT: Edward Elgar, 1995).380  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
price even more—say, to P3—results in a reduction  in quantity. This reduction 
is equivalent to imposing a price ceiling on a competitive industry. A shortage develops, ( Q
3=-Q3), in addition to the deadweight loss from regulation. As the 
price is lowered further, the quantity produced continues to fall and the short-age grows. Finally, if the price is lowered below P
4, the minimum average cost, 
the firm loses money and goes out of business.
Natural Monopoly
Price regulation is most often used for natural monopolies , such as local utility 
companies. A natural monopoly  is a firm that can produce the entire output 
of the market at a cost that is lower than what it would be if there were several firms. If a firm is a natural monopoly, it is more efficient to let it serve the entire market rather than have several firms compete.
A natural monopoly usually arises when there are strong economies of scale, 
as illustrated in Figure 10.12. If the firm represented by the figure was broken up into two competing firms, each supplying half the market, the average cost for each would be higher than the cost incurred by the original monopoly.• natural monopoly  Firm that

PRICE REGULATION
If left alone, a monopolist produces Qm and charges Pm. When the government imposes a 
price ceiling of P1 the firm’s average and marginal revenue are constant and equal to P1 for 
output levels up to Q1. For larger output levels, the original average and marginal revenue 
curves apply. The new marginal revenue curve is, therefore, the dark purple line, which inter-sects the marginal cost curve at Q
1. When price is lowered to Pc, at the point where marginal 
cost intersects average revenue, output increases to its maximum Qc. This is the output that 
would be produced by a competitive industry. Lowering price further, to P3, reduces output to 
Q3 and causes a shortage, Q3=-Q3.CHAPTER 10   •  Market Power: Monopoly and Monopsony  381
Note in Figure 10.12 that because average cost is declining everywhere, mar-
ginal cost is always below average cost. If the firm were unregulated, it would produce Q
m and sell at the price Pm. Ideally, the regulatory agency would like to 
push the firm’s price down to the competitive level Pc. At that level, however, 
price would not cover average cost and the firm would go out of business. The best alternative is therefore to set the price at P
r, where average cost and average 
revenue intersect. In that case, the firm earns no monopoly profit, while output remains as large as possible without driving the firm out of business.
Regulation in Practice
Recall that the competitive price ( Pc in Figure 10.11) is found at the point at 
which the firm’s marginal cost and average revenue (demand) curves intersect. Likewise for a natural monopoly: The minimum feasible price ( P
r in Figure 10.12) 
is found at the point at which average cost and demand intersect. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to determine these prices accurately in practice because the firm’s demand and cost curves may shift as market conditions evolve.
As a result, the regulation of a monopoly is sometimes based on the rate of 
return that it earns on its capital. The regulatory agency determines an allowed price, so that this rate of return is in some sense “competitive” or “fair.” This practice is called rate-of-return regulation:  The maximum price allowed is 
based on the (expected) rate of return that the firm will earn.
13
Unfortunately, difficult problems arise when implementing rate-of-return 
regulation. First, although it is a key element in determining the firm’s rate of return, a firm’s capital stock is difficult to value. Second, while a “fair” rate of QuantityPr

REGULATING THE PRICE OF  
A NATURAL MONOPOLY
A firm is a natural monopoly because it has econ-
omies of scale (declining average and marginal costs) over its entire output range. If price were regulated to be P
c the firm would lose money and 
go out of business. Setting the price at Pr yields 
the largest possible output consistent with the firm’s remaining in business; excess profit is zero.
13Regulatory agencies often use a formula like the following to determine price:
P=AVC +(D+T+sK)/Q
where AVC is average variable cost, Q is output, s is the allowed “fair” rate of return, D is deprecia-
tion, T is taxes, and K is the firm’s current capital stock.• rate-of-return regulation    
Maximum price allowed by a regulatory agency is based on the (expected) rate of return that a firm will earn.382  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
return must be based on the firm’s actual cost of capital, that cost depends in 
turn on the behavior of the regulatory agency (and on investors’ perceptions of what allowed rates of return will be in the future).
The difficulty of agreeing on a set of numbers to be used in rate-of-return 
calculations often leads to delays in the regulatory response to changes in cost and other market conditions (not to mention long and expensive regula-tory hearings). The major beneficiaries are usually lawyers, accountants, and,  occasionally, economic consultants. The net result is regulatory lag —the delays of 
a year or more usually entailed in changing regulated prices.
Another approach to regulation is setting price caps based on the firm’s vari-
able costs, past prices, and possibly inflation and productivity growth. A price cap can allow for more flexibility than rate-of-return regulation. Under price cap regulation, for example, a firm would typically be allowed to raise its prices each year (without having to get approval from the regulatory agency) by an amount equal to the actual rate of inflation, minus expected productivity growth. Price cap regulation of this sort has been used to control prices of long distance and local telephone service.
By the 1990s, the regulatory environment in the United States had changed 
dramatically. Many parts of the telecommunications industry had been dereg-ulated, as had electric utilities in many states. Because scale economies had been largely exhausted, there was no reason to regard these firms as natu-ral monopolies. In addition, technological change made entry by new firms  relatively easy.
10.5  Monopsony
So far, our discussion of market power has focused entirely on the seller side of the market. Now we turn to the buyer  side. We will see that if there are not too 
many buyers, they can also have market power and use it profitably to affect the price they pay for a product.
First, a few terms.
• Monopsony  refers to a market in which there is a single buyer.
• An oligopsony  is a market with only a few buyers.
• With one or only a few buyers, some buyers may have monopsony  power:  
a buyer’s ability to affect the price of a good. Monopsony power enables the buyer to purchase a good for less than the price that would prevail in a  competitive market.
Suppose you are trying to decide how much of a good to purchase. You could 
apply the basic marginal principle—keep purchasing units of the good until the last unit purchased gives additional value, or utility, just equal to the cost of that last unit. In other words, on the margin, additional benefit should just be offset by additional cost.
Let’s look at this additional benefit and additional cost in more detail. We 
use the term marginal value  to refer to the additional benefit from purchasing 
one more unit of a good. How do we determine marginal value? Recall from Chapter 4 that an individual demand curve determines marginal value, or mar-ginal utility, as a function of the quantity purchased. Therefore, your marginal 
value schedule  is your demand  curve for the good. An individual’s demand curve 
slopes downward because the marginal value obtained from buying one more unit of a good declines as the total quantity purchased increases.• oligopsony  Market with only 
a few buyers.
• monopsony power  Buyer’s 
ability to affect the price of a good.
• marginal value  Additional 
benefit derived from purchasing one more unit of a good.
In §4.1, we explain that as we move down along a demand curve, the value the consumer places on an addi-tional unit of the good falls.CHAPTER 10   •  Market Power: Monopoly and Monopsony  383
The additional cost of buying one more unit of a good is called the marginal 
expenditure.  What that marginal expenditure is depends on whether you are 
a competitive buyer or a buyer with monopsony power. Suppose you are a competitive buyer—in other words, you have no influence over the price of the good. In that case, the cost of each unit you buy is the same no matter how many units you purchase; it is the market price of the good. Figure 10.13(a) illustrates this principle. The price you pay per unit is your average expenditure  per unit, 
and it is the same for all units. But what is your marginal expenditure  per unit? As 
a competitive buyer, your marginal expenditure is equal to your average expen-diture, which in turn is equal to the market price of the good.
Figure 10.13(a) also shows your marginal value schedule (i.e., your demand 
curve). How much of the good should you buy? You should buy until the mar-ginal value of the last unit is just equal to the marginal expenditure on that unit. Thus you should purchase quantity Q* at the intersection of the marginal expen-
diture and demand curves.
We introduced the concepts of marginal and average expenditure because 
they will make it easier to understand what happens when buyers have mon-opsony power. But before considering that situation, let’s look at the anal-ogy between competitive buyer conditions and competitive seller conditions. Figure 10.13(b) shows how a perfectly competitive seller decides how much to produce and sell. Because the seller takes the market price as given, both aver-age and marginal revenue are equal to the price. The profit-maximizing quan-tity is at the intersection of the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves.
Now suppose that you are the only buyer of the good. Again you face a mar-
ket supply curve, which tells you how much producers are willing to sell as a function of the price you pay. Should the quantity you purchase be at the point where your marginal value curve intersects the market supply curve? No. If • marginal expenditure

In (a), the competitive buyer takes market price P* as given. Therefore, marginal expenditure and average

you want to maximize your net benefit from purchasing the good, you should 
 purchase a smaller quantity, which you will obtain at a lower price.
To determine how much to buy, set the marginal value from the last unit 
purchased equal to the marginal expenditure on that unit.14 Note, however, 
that the market supply curve is not the marginal expenditure curve. The mar-ket supply curve shows how much you must pay per unit , as a function of the 
total number of units you buy. In other words, the supply curve is the aver-
age expenditure  curve. And because this average expenditure curve is upward 
sloping, the marginal expenditure curve must lie above it. The decision to buy an extra unit raises the price that must be paid for all units, not just the 
extra one.
15
Figure 10.14 illustrates this principle. The optimal quantity for the monopso-
nist to buy, Qm*, is found at the intersection of the demand and marginal expen-
diture curves. The price that the monopsonist pays is found from the supply curve: It is the price P

would prevail in a competitive market, Qc and Pc.
14Mathematically, we can write the net benefit NB from the purchase as NB /H11005 V − E, where V is 
the value to the buyer of the purchase and E is the expenditure. Net benefit is maximized when 
/H9004NB/ /H9004Q=0. Then

15To obtain the marginal expenditure curve algebraically, write the supply curve with price on 
the left-hand side: P /H11005 P(Q). Then total expenditure E is price times quantity, or E /H11005 P(Q)Q, and 
 marginal expenditure is

The market supply curve is monopsonist’s average 
 expenditure curve AE. Because average expenditure is 
rising, marginal expenditure lies above it. The monopso-nist purchases quantity 
Qm*, where marginal expenditure 
and marginal value (demand) intersect. The price paid per unit 
Pm* is then found from the average expenditure 
(supply) curve. In a competitive market, price and quanti-ty, P
c and Qc, are both higher. They are found at the point 
where  average  expenditure (supply) and marginal value

Monopsony and Monopoly Compared
Monopsony is easier to understand if you compare it with monopoly. 
Figures  10.15(a) and 10.15(b) illustrate this comparison. Recall that a monopo-
list can charge a price above marginal cost because it faces a downward-sloping demand, or average revenue curve, so that marginal revenue is less than aver-age revenue. Equating marginal cost with marginal revenue leads to a quantity Q* that is less than what would be produced in a competitive market, and to a 
price P* that is higher than the competitive price P
c.
The monopsony situation is exactly analogous. As Figure 10.15(b) illus-
trates, the monopsonist can purchase a good at a price below its marginal value  
because it faces an upward-sloping supply, or average expenditure, curve. Thus for a monopsonist, marginal expenditure is greater than average expenditure. Equating marginal value with marginal expenditure leads to a quantity Q* that 
is less than what would be bought in a competitive market, and to a price P* that 
is lower than the competitive price P
c.
10.6  Monopsony Power
Much more common than pure monopsony are markets with only a few firms 
competing among themselves as buyers, so that each firm has some monop-sony power. For example, the major U.S. automobile manufacturers compete with one another as buyers of tires. Because each of them accounts for a large

MONOPOLY AND MONOPSONY
These diagrams show the close analogy between monopoly and monopsony. (a) The monopolist produces 
where marginal revenue intersects marginal cost. Average revenue exceeds marginal revenue, so that price exceeds marginal cost. (b) The monopsonist purchases up to the point where marginal expenditure intersects 
marginal value. Marginal expenditure exceeds average expenditure, so that marginal value exceeds price.386  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
share of the tire market, each has some monopsony power in that market. 
General Motors, the largest, might be able to exert considerable monopsony power when contracting for supplies of tires (and other automotive parts).
In a competitive market, price and marginal value are equal. A buyer with mon-
opsony power, however, can purchase a good at a price below marginal value. The extent to which price is marked down below marginal value depends on the elastic-ity of supply facing the buyer.
16 If supply is very elastic ( ES is large), the markdown 
will be small and the buyer will have little monopsony power. Conversely, if sup-ply is very inelastic, the markdown will be large and the buyer will have consider-able monopsony power. Figures 10.16(a) and 10.16(b) illustrate these two cases.
Sources of Monopsony Power
What determines the degree of monopsony power in a market? Again, we can draw analogies with monopoly and monopoly power. We saw that monopoly power depends on three things: the elasticity of market demand, the number of sellers in the market, and the way those sellers interact. Monopsony power depends on three similar things: The elasticity of market supply, the number of buyers in the market, and the way those buyers interact.
ELASTICITY OF MARKET SUPPLY  A monopsonist benefits because it faces an 
upward-sloping supply curve, so that marginal expenditure exceeds  average

MONOPSONY POWER: ELASTIC VERSUS INELASTIC SUPPLY
Monopsony power depends on the elasticity of supply. When supply is elastic, as in (a), marginal expendi-
ture and average expenditure do not differ by much, so price is close to what it would be in a competitive market. The opposite is true when supply is inelastic, as in (b).CHAPTER 10   •  Market Power: Monopoly and Monopsony  387
expenditure. The less elastic the supply curve, the greater the difference between 
marginal expenditure and average expenditure and the more monopsony power the buyer enjoys. If only one buyer is in the market—a pure monopsonist—its monopsony power is completely determined by the elasticity of market supply. If supply is highly elastic, monopsony power is small and there is little gain in being the only buyer.
NUMBER OF BUYERS  Most markets have more than one buyer, and the num-
ber of buyers is an important determinant of monopsony power. When the number of buyers is very large, no single buyer can have much influence over price. Thus each buyer faces an extremely elastic supply curve, so that the mar-ket is almost completely competitive. The potential for monopsony power arises when the number of buyers is limited.
INTERACTION AMONG BUYERS  Finally, suppose three or four buyers are 
in the market. If those buyers compete aggressively, they will bid up the price close to their marginal value of the product, and will thus have little monopsony power. On the other hand, if those buyers compete less aggressively, or even col-lude, prices will not be bid up very much, and the buyers’ degree of monopsony power might be nearly as high as if there were only one buyer.
So, as with monopoly power, there is no simple way to predict how much 
monopsony power buyers will have in a market. We can count the number of buyers, and we can often estimate the elasticity of supply, but that is not enough. Monopsony power also depends on the interaction among buyers, which can be more difficult to ascertain.
The Social Costs of Monopsony Power
Because monopsony power results in lower prices and lower quantities pur-chased, we would expect it to make the buyer better off and sellers worse off. But suppose we value the welfare of buyers and sellers equally. How is aggre-gate welfare affected by monopsony power?
We can find out by comparing the buyer and seller surplus that results from 
a competitive market to the surplus that results when a monopsonist is the sole buyer. Figure 10.17 shows the average and marginal expenditure curves and marginal value curve for the monopsonist. The monopsonist’s net benefit is maximized by purchasing a quantity Q
m at a price Pm such that marginal value 
equals marginal expenditure. In a competitive market, price equals marginal value. Thus the competitive price and quantity, P
c and Qc, are found where the 
average expenditure and marginal value curves intersect. Now let’s see how surplus changes if we move from the competitive price and quantity, P
c and Qc, 
to the monopsony price and quantity, Pm and Qm.
With monopsony, the price is lower and less is sold. Because of the lower 
price, sellers lose an amount of surplus given by rectangle A. In addition, sell-
ers lose the surplus given by triangle C because of the reduced sales. The total 
loss of producer (seller) surplus is therefore A /H11001 C. By buying at a lower price, 
the buyer gains the surplus given by rectangle A. However, the buyer buys less, 
Qm instead of Qc, and so loses the surplus given by triangle B. The total gain in 
surplus to the buyer is therefore A − B. Altogether, there is a net loss of surplus 
given by B /H11001 C. This is the deadweight loss from monopsony power.  Even if the 
monopsonist’s gains were taxed away and redistributed to the producers, there would be an inefficiency because output would be lower than under competi-tion. The deadweight loss is the social cost of this inefficiency.Note the similarity with 
the deadweight loss from monopoly power discussed in §10.4.388  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
Bilateral Monopoly
What happens when a monopolist meets a monopsonist? It’s hard to say. We 
call a market with only one seller and only one buyer a bilateral monopoly.  
If you think about such a market, you’ll see why it is difficult to predict the price and quantity. Both the buyer and the seller are in a bargaining situation. Unfortunately, no simple rule determines which, if either, will get the better part of the bargain. One party might have more time and patience, or might be able to convince the other party that it will walk away if the price is too low or too high.
Bilateral monopoly is rare. Markets in which a few producers have some 
monopoly power and sell to a few buyers who have some monopsony power are more common. Although bargaining may still be involved, we can apply a rough principle here: Monopsony power and monopoly power will tend to counteract 
each other.  In other words, the monopsony power of buyers will reduce the effec-
tive monopoly power of sellers, and vice versa. This tendency does not mean that the market will end up looking perfectly competitive; if, for example, monop-oly power is large and monopsony power small, the residual monopoly power would still be significant. But in general, monopsony power will push price closer to marginal cost, and monopoly power will push price closer to marginal value.• bilateral monopoly  Market

EXAMPLE 10.5  MONOPSONY POWER IN U.S. MANUFACTURING
Monopoly power, as measured by 
the price-cost margin ( P − MC)/ P, 
varies considerably across manu-facturing industries in the United States. Some industries have price-cost margins close to zero, while in others margins are as high as 0.4 or 0.5. These  variations 
are due in part to differences in the determinants of monopoly 
power: In some industries, mar-ket demand is more elastic than in others; some industries have more sellers than others; and in some industries, sellers compete more aggressively than in others. But something else can help explain these variations in monopoly 
CHAPTER 10   •  Market Power: Monopoly and Monopsony  389
17The study was by Steven H. Lustgarten, “The Impact of Buyer Concentration in Manufacturing 
Industries,” Review of Economics and Statistics  57 (May 1975): 125–32.power—differences in monopsony power among 
the firms’ customers.
The role of monopsony power was investigated in 
a statistical study of 327 U.S. manufacturing indus-tries.
17 The study sought to determine the extent 
to which variations in price–cost margins could be attributed to variations in monopsony power by buyers in each industry. Although the degree of buyers’ monopsony power could not be measured directly, data were available for variables that help determine monopsony power, such as buyer con-
centration (the fraction of total sales going to the three or four largest firms) and the average annual size of buyers’ orders.
The study found that buyers’ monopsony power 
had an important effect on the price–cost mar-gins of sellers and could significantly reduce any monopoly power that sellers might otherwise have. Take, for example, the concentration of buyers, an important determinant of monopsony power. In industries where only four or five buyers account for all or nearly all sales, the price–cost margins of sell-ers would on average be as much as 10 percent-age points lower than in comparable industries with hundreds of buyers accounting for sales.
A good example of monopsony power in manu-
facturing is the market for automobile parts and  components, such as brakes and radiators. Each 
major car producer in the United States typically buys an individual part from at least three, and often as many as a dozen, suppliers. In addition, for a stan-dardized product, such as brakes, each automobile company usually produces part of its needs itself, so that it is not totally reliant on outside firms. This puts companies like General Motors and Ford in an excel-lent bargaining position with respect to their suppli-ers. Each supplier must compete for sales against five or 10 other suppliers, but each can sell to only a few buyers. For a specialized part, a single auto company may be the only buyer. As a result, the automobile 
companies have considerable monopsony power.
This monopsony power becomes evident from 
the conditions under which suppliers must operate. To obtain a sales contract, a supplier must have a track record of reliability, in terms of both product quality and ability to meet tight delivery sched-ules. Suppliers are also often required to respond to changes in volume as auto sales and production levels fluctuate. Finally, pricing negotiations are notoriously difficult; a potential supplier will some-times lose a contract because its bid is a penny per item higher than those of its competitors. Not  surprisingly, producers of parts and components 
usually have little or no monopoly power.
10.7   Limiting Market Power: 
The Antitrust Laws
We have seen that market power—whether wielded by sellers or buyers—harms 
potential purchasers who could have bought at competitive prices. In addition, market power reduces output, which leads to a deadweight loss. Excessive mar-ket power also raises problems of equity and fairness: If a firm has significant monopoly power, it will profit at the expense of consumers. In theory, a firm’s excess profits could be taxed away and redistributed to the buyers of its products, but such a redistribution is often impractical. It is difficult to determine what por-tion of a firm’s profit is attributable to monopoly power, and it is even more diffi-cult to locate all the buyers and reimburse them in proportion to their purchases.
How, then, can society limit market power and prevent it from being used 
anticompetitively? For a natural monopoly, such as an electric utility company, direct price regulation is the answer. But more generally, the answer is to pre-vent firms from obtaining excessive market power through mergers and acqui-sitions, and to prevent firms that already have market power from using it to restrict competition. In the United States and most other countries, this is done 390  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
via antitrust laws:  rules and regulations designed to promote a competitive 
economy by prohibiting actions that are likely to restrain competition.
Antitrust laws differ from country to country, and we will focus mostly on 
how those laws work in the United States. But it is important to stress at the outset that in the United States and elsewhere, while there are limitations (such as colluding with other firms), in general, it is not illegal to be a monopolist or to have 
market power.  On the contrary, we have seen that patent and copyright laws  pro-
tect the monopoly positions of firms that developed unique innovations. Thus Microsoft has a near-monopoly in personal computer operating systems because other firms are prohibited from copying Windows. Even if Microsoft had a com-plete monopoly in operating systems (it doesn’t—the Apple and Linux operat-ing systems also compete in the market), that would not be illegal. What might be illegal, however, is if Microsoft used its monopoly power in personal com-puter operating systems to prevent other firms from entering with new operat-ing systems, or to leverage its power and reduce competition in other markets. As we will see in Example 10.8, that was the basis for lawsuits brought against Microsoft by the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission.
Restricting What Firms Can Do
Innovation drives economic growth and enhances consumer welfare, so we are delighted when Apple gains market power by inventing the iPhone and iPad, or when a pharmaceutical company gains market power through its invention of a new life-saving drug. But there are other ways in which firms can gain market power that are not so laudable, and this is where the antitrust laws come into play. At a fundamental level, the laws work as follows.
Section 1 of the Sherman Act (which was passed in 1890) prohibits contracts, 
combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade. One obvious example of an illegal combination is an explicit agreement among producers to restrict their out-put and/or to “fix” price above the competitive level. There have been numerous instances of such illegal combinations and conspiracies, as Example 10.7 illustrates. 
Implicit  collusion in the form of parallel conduct  can also be construed as vio-
lating the law. For example, if Firm B consistently follows Firm A’s pricing (paral-
lel pricing), and if the firm’s conduct is contrary to what one would expect compa-nies to do in the absence of collusion (such as raising prices in the face of decreased demand and over-supply), an implicit understanding may be inferred.
18
Section 2 of the Sherman Act makes it illegal to monopolize or to attempt 
to monopolize a market and prohibits conspiracies that result in monopoliza-tion. The Clayton Act (1914) did much to pinpoint the kinds of practices that are likely to be anticompetitive. For example, the act makes it unlawful for a firm with a large market share to require the buyer or lessor of a good not to buy from a competitor. It also makes it illegal to engage in predatory pricing —
pricing designed to drive current competitors out of business and to discourage new entrants (so that the predatory firm can enjoy higher prices in the future).
Monopoly power can also be achieved by a merger of firms into a larger and 
more dominant firm, or by one firm acquiring or taking control of another firm • antitrust laws  Rules and 
regulations prohibiting actions that restrain, or are likely to restrain, competition.
• parallel conduct  Form of 
implicit collusion in which one firm consistently follows actions of another.
• predatory pricing  Practice 
of pricing to drive current competitors out of business and to discourage new entrants in a market so that a firm can enjoy higher future profits.
18The Sherman Act applies to all firms that do business in the United States (to the extent that a 
conspiracy to restrain trade could affect U.S. markets). However, foreign governments (or firms operating under their government’s control) are not subject to the act, so OPEC need not fear the wrath of the Justice Department. Also, firms can collude with respect to exports.  The Webb-Pomerene 
Act (1918) allows price fixing and related collusion with respect to export markets, as long as domestic 
markets are unaffected by such collusion.  Firms operating in this manner must form a “Webb-Pomerene 
Association” and register it with the government.CHAPTER 10   •  Market Power: Monopoly and Monopsony  391
by purchasing its stock. The Clayton Act prohibits mergers and acquisitions if 
they “substantially lessen competition” or “tend to create a monopoly.”
The antitrust laws also limit possible anticompetitive conduct by firms in 
other ways. For example, the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act (1936), makes it illegal to discriminate by charging buyers of essentially the same product different prices if those price differences are likely to injure competition. Even then, firms are not liable if they can show that the price dif-ferences were necessary to meet competition. (As we will see in the next chap-ter, price discrimination is a common practice. It becomes the target of antitrust action only when buyers suffer economic damages and competition is reduced.)
Another important component of the antitrust laws is the Federal Trade 
Commission Act (1914, amended in 1938, 1973, 1975), which created the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). This act supplements the Sherman and Clayton acts by fostering competition through a whole set of prohibitions against unfair and anticompetitive practices, such as deceptive advertising and labeling, agree-ments with retailers to exclude competing brands, and so on. Because these prohibitions are interpreted and enforced in administrative proceedings before the FTC, the act provides broad powers that reach further than those of other antitrust laws.
The antitrust laws are actually phrased vaguely in terms of what is and what 
is not allowed. They are intended to provide a general statutory framework to give the Justice Department, the FTC, and the courts wide discretion in inter-preting and applying them. This approach is important because it is difficult to know in advance what might be an impediment to competition. Such ambiguity creates a need for common law (i.e., the practice whereby courts interpret stat-utes) and supplemental provisions and rulings (e.g., by the FTC or the Justice Department).
Enforcement of the Antitrust Laws
The antitrust laws are enforced in three ways:
 1. Through the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice.  As an arm 
of the executive branch, its enforcement policies closely reflect the view of the administration in power. Responding to an external complaint or an internal study, the department can institute a criminal proceeding, bring a civil suit, or both. The result of a criminal action can be fines for the corpo-ration and fines or jail sentences for individuals. For example, individuals who conspire to fix prices or rig bids can be charged with a felony and, if found guilty, may be sentenced to jail—something to remember if you are planning to parlay your knowledge of microeconomics into a successful business career! Losing a civil action forces a corporation to cease its anti-competitive practices and often to pay damages.
 2. Through the administrative procedures of the Federal Trade Commission.   
Again, action can result from an external complaint or from the FTC’s own initiative. Should the FTC decide that action is required, it can either request a voluntary understanding to comply with the law or seek a formal commission order requiring compliance.
 3. Through private proceedings.  Individuals or companies can sue for  treble 
(three-fold) damages  inflicted on their businesses or property. The pros-
pect of treble damages can be a strong deterrent to would-be violators. Individuals or companies can also ask the courts for injunctions to force wrongdoers to cease anticompetitive actions.392  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
U.S. antitrust laws are more stringent and far-reaching than those of most 
other countries. In fact, some people have argued that they have prevented American industry from competing effectively in international markets. The laws certainly constrain American business and may at times have put American firms at a disadvantage in world markets. But this criticism must be weighed against their benefits: Antitrust laws have been crucial for maintaining competition, and competition is essential for economic efficiency, innovation, and growth.
Antitrust in Europe
As the European Union has grown, its methods of antitrust enforcement have evolved. The responsibility for the enforcement of antitrust concerns that involve two or more member states resides in a single entity, the Competition Directorate, located in Brussels. Separate and distinct antitrust authorities within individual member states are responsible for those issues whose effects are felt largely or entirely within particular countries.
At first glance, the antitrust laws of the European Union are quite simi-
lar to those of the United States. Article 101 of the Treaty of the European Community concerns restraints of trade, much like Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Article 102, which focuses on abuses of market power by dominant  firms, 
is similar in many ways to Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Finally, with respect to mergers, the European Merger Control Act is similar in spirit to Section 7 of the Clayton Act.
Nevertheless, there remain a number of procedural and substantive differ-
ences between antitrust laws in Europe and the United States. Merger evalua-tions typically are conducted more quickly in Europe, and it is easier in practice to prove that a European firm is dominant than it is to show that a U.S. firm has monopoly power. Both the European Union and the U.S. have been actively enforcing laws against price fixing, but Europe imposes only civil penalties, whereas the U.S. can impose prison sentences as well as fines.
Antitrust enforcement has grown rapidly through the world in the past 
decade. Today, there are active enforcement agencies in over one hundred countries. While there is no formal world-wide antitrust enforcement body, all enforcement agencies meet at least once each year through the auspices of the International Competition Network.
19According to the New York Times , February 24, 1983.EXAMPLE 10.6  A PHONE CALL ABOUT PRICES
In 1981 and early 1982, American Airlines and 
Braniff Airways were competing fiercely with each other for passengers. A fare war broke out as the firms undercut each other’s prices to capture mar-ket share. On February 21, 1982, Robert Crandall, president and CEO of American, made a phone call to Howard Putnam, president and chief executive of Braniff. To Crandall’s later surprise, the call had been 
taped. It went like this:
19
Crandall  I think it’s dumb as hell for Christ’s sake, 
all right, to sit here and pound the @!#$%&! out of each other and neither one of us making a @!#$%&! dime.CHAPTER 10   •  Market Power: Monopoly and Monopsony  393
Putnam  Well…
Crandall  I mean, you know, @!#$%&!, what the 
hell is the point of it?
Putnam  But if you’re going to overlay every route 
of American’s on top of every route that Braniff has—I just can’t sit here and allow you to bury us without giving our best effort.
Crandall  Oh sure, but Eastern and Delta do the 
same thing in Atlanta and have for years.
Putnam  Do you have a suggestion for me?
Crandall  Yes, I have a suggestion for you. Raise 
your @!#$%&! fares 20 percent. I’ll raise mine the next morning.
Putnam  Robert, we…
Crandall  You’ll make more money and I will, too.
Putnam  We can’t talk about pricing!
Crandall  Oh @!#$%&!, Howard. We can talk 
about any @!#$%&! thing we want to talk about.Crandall was wrong. Corporate executives can-
not talk about anything they want. Talking about prices and agreeing to fix them is a clear violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Putnam must have known this because he promptly rejected Crandall’s suggestion. After learning about the call, the Justice Department filed a suit accusing Crandall of violating the antitrust laws by propos-ing to fix prices.
However, proposing  to fix prices is not enough 
to violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act: For the law to be violated, the two parties must agree  to 
collude. Therefore, because Putnam had rejected Crandall’s proposal, Section 1 was not violated. The court later ruled, however, that a proposal to fix prices could be an attempt to monopolize part of the airline industry and, if so, would violate Section 2 of the Sherman Act. American Airlines promised the Justice Department never again to engage in such activity.
EXAMPLE 10.7  GO DIRECTLY TO JAIL. DON’T PASS GO.
Corporate executives sometimes forget that price fixing is a criminal act in the United States that can lead not only to stiff fines, but also a prison sentence. Sitting in a prison cell is no fun. The Internet and cell phone service is terrible, there is no cable TV, and the food leaves much to be desired. So if you become a successful business executive, think twice before picking up the phone. And if your com-pany happens to be located in Europe or Asia, don’t think that will keep you out of a U.S. jail. For example:
•  In 1996 Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and 
two other producers of lysine (an animal feed additive) pled guilty to charges of price fixing. In 1999 three ADM executives were sentenced to prison terms of two to three years.
20• In 1999 four of the world’s 
largest drug and chemical com-panies—Hoffman-La Roche of Switzerland, BASF of Germany, Rhone Poulenc of France, and Takeda of Japan—pled guilty to fixing the prices of vitamins sold in the U.S. and Europe. The com-panies paid about $1.5 billion in penalties to the U.S. Department 
of Justice (DOJ), $1 billion to the European Commission, and over $4 billion to settle civil suits. Executives from each of the companies did prison time in the U.S.
•  During 2002 to 2009, Horizon Lines engaged 
in price fixing with Sea Star Lines (Puerto Rico-based shipping companies). Five executives got prison terms ranging from one to four years.
20Of course, it is always possible that you could be portrayed in a movie. In the 2009 movie, 
The Informant , actor Matt Damon played the role of Mark Whitacre, the ADM executive who blew 
the whistle on the price-fixing conspiracy, and then served a prison term for embezzlement.394  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
EXAMPLE 10.8   THE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN 
UNION VERSUS MICROSOFT
Over the past two decades Microsoft 
has grown to become the largest com-puter software company in the world. Its Windows operating system for per-sonal computers has maintained over a 90 percent market share. Microsoft has also continued to dominate the office productivity market. Its Office Suite, which includes Word (word pro-cessing), Excel (spreadsheets), and Powerpoint (presentations), has held over a 95 percent worldwide market share for nearly a decade.
Microsoft’s incredible success has been due in 
good part to the creative technological and market-ing decisions of the company and its now-retired CEO, Bill Gates. Is there anything wrong as a matter of either economics or law with being so successful and dominant? It all depends. Under the antitrust laws of the United States and the European Union, efforts by firms to restrain trade or to engage in activities that inappropriately maintain monopolies are illegal. Did Microsoft engage in anticompetitive, illegal practices?
In 1998, the U.S. government said yes; Microsoft 
disagreed. The Antitrust Division of the U.S. DOJ filed suit, claiming that Microsoft had illegally bun-dled its Internet browser, Internet Explorer, with its operating system for the purpose of maintain-ing its dominant operating system monopoly. The DOJ claimed that Microsoft viewed Netscape’s Internet browser (Netscape Navigator) as a threat to its monopoly over the PC operating system market. The threat existed because Netscape’s browser included Sun’s Java software, which can run  programs that have been written 
for any operating system, including those that compete with Windows.
Following an eight-month trial that 
was hard-fought on a range of economic issues, the District Court found that Microsoft did have monopoly power in the market for PC operating systems, which it had  maintained illegally in vio-
lation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. However, the court did find that certain exclusionary  agreements with computer 
manufacturers and Internet service providers had not foreclosed competition sufficiently to violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act. On appeal, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals supported these aspects of the District Court’s opinion while leaving undecided whether bundling Internet Explorer in the operating system was itself illegal.
The U.S. case was ultimately settled in 2004, with 
(among other things) Microsoft agreeing to give computer manufacturers (1) the ability to offer an operating system without Internet Explorer and (2) the option of loading competing browser programs on the PCs that they sell.
Microsoft’s problems did not end with the U.S. set-
tlement, however. In 2004, the European Commission ordered Microsoft to pay $794 million in fines for its anticompetitive practices and to produce a version of Windows without the Windows Media Player to be sold alongside its standard editions. In 2008, the European Commission levied an  additional fine of 
$1.44 billion, claiming that Microsoft had not com-plied with the earlier decision. Even more recently,

• In 2009, five companies pled guilty to fixing 
prices of LCD displays during 2001 to 2006. 22 executives received prison sentences in the United States (on top of $1 billion in 
fines).
• In 2011, two companies were convicted of  fixing 
prices and rigging bids for ready-mix concrete in Iowa. One executive was sentenced to one year in prison, another to four years.

QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW
 1. A monopolist is producing at a point at which mar-
ginal cost exceeds marginal revenue. How should it adjust its output to increase profit?
 2. We write the percentage markup of price over mar-
ginal cost as ( P − MC)/ P. For a profit-maximizing 
monopolist, how does this markup depend on the elasticity of demand? Why can this markup be viewed as a measure of monopoly power?
 3. Why is there no market supply curve under conditions 
of monopoly?
 4. Why might a firm have monopoly power even if it is 
not the only producer in the market?
 5. What are some of the different types of barriers to entry 
that give rise to monopoly power? Give an example of each.
 6. What factors determine the amount of monopoly 
power an individual firm is likely to have? Explain each one briefly.
 7. Why is there a social cost to monopoly power? If the 
gains to producers from monopoly power could be redistributed to consumers, would the social cost of monopoly power be eliminated? Explain briefly. 8. Why will a monopolist’s output increase if the gov-
ernment forces it to lower its price? If the government wants to set a price ceiling that maximizes the monop-olist’s output, what price should it set?
 9. How should a monopsonist decide how much of a 
product to buy? Will it buy more or less than a com-petitive buyer? Explain briefly.
 10. What is meant by the term “monopsony power”? Why 
might a firm have monopsony power even if it is not the only buyer in the market?
 11. What are some sources of monopsony power? What 
determines the amount of monopsony power an indi-vidual firm is likely to have?
 12. Why is there a social cost to monopsony power? If 
the gains to buyers from monopsony power could be redistributed to sellers, would the social cost of mon-opsony power be eliminated? Explain briefly.
 13. How do the antitrust laws limit market power in the 
United States? Give examples of major provisions of these laws.
 14. Explain briefly how the U.S. antitrust laws are actually 
enforced.SUMMARY
 1. Market power is the ability of sellers or buyers to affect 
the price of a good.
 2. Market power comes in two forms. When sellers charge 
a price that is above marginal cost, we say that they have monopoly power, which we measure by the extent to which price exceeds marginal cost. When buyers can obtain a price below their marginal value of the good, we say they have monopsony power, which we measure by the extent to which marginal value exceeds price.
 3. Monopoly power is determined in part by the num-
ber of firms competing in a market. If there is only one firm—a pure monopoly—monopoly power depends entirely on the elasticity of market demand. The less elastic the demand, the more monopoly power the firm will have. When there are several firms, monop-oly power also depends on how the firms interact. The more aggressively they compete, the less monopoly power each firm will have. 4. Monopsony power is determined in part by the num-
ber of buyers in a market. If there is only one buyer—a pure monopsony—monopsony power depends on the  elasticity of market supply. The less elastic the sup-ply, the more monopsony power the buyer will have. When there are several buyers, monopsony power also depends on how aggressively they compete for supplies.
 5. Market power can impose costs on society. Because 
monopoly and monopsony power both cause  production to fall below the competitive level, there is a deadweight loss of consumer and producer sur-plus. There can be additional social costs from rent seeking.
 6. Sometimes, scale economies make pure monopoly 
desirable. But the government will still want to regu-late price to maximize social welfare.
 7. More generally, we rely on the antitrust laws to pre-
vent firms from obtaining excessive market power.in response to a concern relating to the bundling 
of browsers, Microsoft agreed to offer customers a choice of browsers when first booting up their new operating system.
As of 2011, the European case against Microsoft 
remains on appeal. There is strong evidence that the European-imposed remedies have had little 
impact on the market for media players or brows-ers. However, Microsoft is facing an even stronger threat than U.S. or E.U. enforcement, such as com-petition from the powerful Google search engine and social media sites such as Facebook.396  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy

20th century involved the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) in 1945. At that time, Alcoa control-led about 90 percent of primary aluminum produc-tion in the United States, and the company had been accused of monopolizing the aluminum market. In its defense, Alcoa argued that although it indeed controlled a large fraction of the primary market, secondary aluminum (i.e., aluminum produced from the recycling of scrap) accounted for roughly 30 percent of the total supply of aluminum and that many competitive firms were engaged in recy-cling. Therefore, Alcoa argued, it did not have much monopoly power.

As we explained in Chapter 10, market power is quite common. 
Many industries have only a few producers, so that each pro-ducer has some monopoly power. And many firms, as buyers 
of raw materials, labor, or specialized capital goods, have some monop-sony power in the markets for these factor inputs. The problem faced by the managers of these firms is how to use their market power most effectively.  
They must decide how to set prices, choose quantities of factor inputs, and determine output in both the short and long run to maximize profit.
Managers of firms with market power have a harder job than those 
who manage perfectly competitive firms. A firm that is perfectly com-petitive in output markets has no influence over market price. As a result, its managers need worry only about the cost side of the firm’s operations, choosing output so that price is equal to marginal cost. But the managers of a firm with monopoly power must also worry about the characteristics of demand. Even if they set a single price for the firm’s output, they must obtain at least a rough estimate of the elastic-ity of demand to determine what that price (and corresponding output level) should be. Furthermore, firms can often do much better by using a more complicated pricing strategy—for example, charging different prices to different customers. To design such pricing strategies, man-agers need ingenuity and even more information about demand.
This chapter explains how firms with market power set prices. We 
begin with the basic objective of every pricing strategy: capturing con-sumer surplus and converting it into additional profit for the firm. Then we discuss how this goal can be achieved using price discrimi-
nation —charging different prices to different customers, sometimes 
for the same product and sometimes for small variations in the prod-uct. Because price discrimination is widely practiced in one form or another, it is important to understand how it works.
Next, we discuss the two-part tariff —requiring customers to pay in 
advance for the right to purchase units of a good at a later time (and at additional cost). The classic example of this is an amusement park, where customers pay a fee to enter and then additional fees for each ride. Although amusement parks may seem like a rather specialized market, there are many other examples of two-part tariffs: the price of a Gillette razor, which gives the owner the opportunity to purchase Gillette razor blades; a tennis club, where members pay an annual fee and then an hourly rate for court time; or the monthly subscription 11.1

cost of  long-distance telephone service, which gives users the opportunity to 
make long-distance calls, paying by the minute as they do so.
We will also discuss bundling , a pricing strategy that involves tying products 
together and selling them as a package. For example: a personal computer that comes bundled with several software packages; a one-week vacation in which the airfare, rental car, and hotel are bundled and sold at a single package price; or a luxury car, in which the sun roof, power windows, and leather seats are “standard” features.
Finally, we will examine the use of advertising  by firms with market power. 
As we will see, deciding how much money to spend on advertising requires information about demand and is closely related to the firm’s pricing decision. We will derive a simple rule of thumb for determining the profit-maximizing advertising-to-sales ratio.
11.1  Capturing Consumer Surplus
All the pricing strategies that we will examine have one thing in common: They 
are means of capturing consumer surplus and transferring it to the producer.  You can 
see this more clearly in Figure 11.1. Suppose the firm sold all its output at a single price. To maximize profit, it would pick a price P* and corresponding 
output Q* at the intersection of its marginal cost and marginal revenue curves. 
Although the firm would then be profitable, its managers might still wonder if they could make it even more profitable.
They know that some customers (in region A of the demand curve) would 
pay more than P*. But raising the price would mean losing some customers, sell-
ing less, and earning smaller profits. Similarly, other potential customers are not buying the firm’s product because they will not pay a price as high as P*. Many 
of them, however, would pay prices higher than the firm’s marginal cost. (These customers are in region B of the demand curve.) By lowering its price, the firm Consumer surplus is 
explained in §4.4 and reviewed in §9.1.

CAPTURING CONSUMER SURPLUS
If a firm can charge only one price for all its customers, 
that price will be P* and the quantity produced will 
be Q*. Ideally, the firm would like to charge a higher 
price to consumers willing to pay more than P*, there-
by capturing some of the consumer surplus under re-
gion A of the demand curve. The firm would also like 
to sell to consumers willing to pay prices lower than P*, but only if doing so does not entail lowering the 
price to other consumers. In that way, the firm could also capture some of the surplus under region B of the 
demand curve.CHAPTER 11   •  Pricing with Market Power  401
could sell to some of these customers. Unfortunately, it would then earn less 
revenue from its existing customers, and again profits would shrink.
How can the firm capture the consumer surplus (or at least part of it) from its 
customers in region A, and perhaps also sell profitably to some of its potential cus-
tomers in region B? Charging a single price clearly will not do the trick. However, 
the firm might charge different prices to different customers, according to where the customers are along the demand curve. For example, some customers in the upper end of region A would be charged the higher price P
1, some in region B 
would be charged the lower price P2, and some in between would be charged P*. 
This is the basis of price discrimination:  charging different prices to different cus-
tomers. The problem, of course, is to identify the different customers, and to get them to pay different prices. We will see how this can be done in the next section.
The other pricing techniques that we will discuss in this chapter—two-part 
tariffs and bundling—also expand the range of a firm’s market to include more customers and to capture more consumer surplus. In each case, we will examine both the amount by which the firm’s profit can be increased and the effect on consumer welfare. (As we will see, when there is a high degree of monopoly power, these pricing techniques can sometimes make both consumers and the producer better off.) We turn first to price discrimination.
11.2  Price Discrimination
Price discrimination can take three broad forms, which we call first-, second-, and third-degree price discrimination. We will examine them in turn.
First-Degree Price Discrimination
Ideally, a firm would like to charge a different price to each of its customers. If it could, it would charge each customer the maximum price that the customer is willing to pay for each unit bought. We call this maximum price the customer’s reservation price.  The practice of charging each customer his or her reservation 
price is called perfect first-degree price discrimination.
1 Let’s see how it affects 
the firm’s profit.
First, we need to know the profit that the firm earns when it charges only the 
single price P* in Figure 11.2. To find out, we can add the profit on each incremen-
tal unit produced and sold, up to the total quantity Q*. This incremental profit is 
the marginal revenue less the marginal cost for each unit. In Figure 11.2, this mar-ginal revenue is highest and marginal cost lowest for the first unit. For each addi-tional unit, marginal revenue falls and marginal cost rises. Thus the firm produces the total output Q*, at which point marginal revenue and marginal cost are equal.
If we add up the profits on each incremental unit produced, we obtain the 
firm’s variable profit;  the firm’s profit, ignoring its fixed costs. In Figure 11.2, vari-
able profit is given by the yellow-shaded  area between the marginal revenue and 
marginal cost curves.
2 Consumer surplus, which is the area between the average 
revenue curve and the price P* that customers pay, is outlined as a black triangle.• price discrimination
Practice of charging different 
prices to different consumers for similar goods.
• reservation price  Maximum 
price that a customer is willing to pay for a good.
• first-degree price 
discrimination  Practice of 
charging each customer her reservation price.
In §8.3, we explain that a firm’s profit-maximizing  output is the output at which 
marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost.
• variable profit
 Sum of 
profits on each incremental unit produced by a firm; i.e., profit ignoring fixed costs.
1We are assuming that each customer buys one unit of the good. If a customer buys more than one 
unit, the firm will have to charge different prices for each of the units.
2Recall from Chapter 10 that because total profit p is the difference between total revenue R and total 
cost C, incremental profit is just /H9004p=/H9004R-/H9004C=MR -MC. Variable profit is found by sum-
ming all the /H9004ps, and thus it is the area between the MR and MC curves. This ignores fixed costs, 
which are independent of the firm’s output and pricing decisions. Thus, total profit equals variable profit minus fixed cost.402  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
PERFECT PRICE DISCRIMINATION  What happens if the firm can perfectly price 
discriminate? Because each consumer is charged exactly what he or she is will-ing to pay, the marginal revenue curve is no longer relevant to the firm’s output  decision. Instead, the incremental revenue earned from each additional unit sold is simply the price paid for that unit; it is therefore given by the demand curve.
Since price discrimination does not affect the firm’s cost structure, the cost of 
each additional unit is again given by the firm’s marginal cost curve. Therefore, the additional profit from producing and selling an incremental unit is now the  difference between demand and marginal cost.  As long as demand exceeds marginal 
cost, the firm can increase its profit by expanding production. It will do so until it produces a total output Q**. At Q**, demand is equal to marginal cost, and 
 producing any more reduces profit.
Variable profit is now given by the area between the demand and marginal cost 
curves.
3 Observe from Figure 11.2 how the firm’s profit has increased. (The addi-
tional profit resulting from price discrimination is shown by the purple-shaded area.) Note also that because every customer is being charged the maximum amount that he or she is willing to pay, all consumer surplus has been captured by the firm.
IMPERFECT PRICE DISCRIMINATION  In practice, perfect first-degree price 
discrimination is almost never possible. First, it is usually impractical to charge each and every customer a different price (unless there are only a few custom-ers). Second, a firm usually does not know the reservation price of each cus-tomer. Even if it could ask how much each customer would be willing to pay, $/Q

ADDITIONAL PROFIT FROM 
PERFECT FIRST-DEGREE PRICE DISCRIMINATION
Because the firm charges each con-
sumer her reservation price, it is prof-itable to  expand output to Q**. When 
only a single price, P*, is charged, the 
firm’s variable profit is the area between the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves. With perfect price discrimina-tion, this profit  expands to the area 
 between the demand curve and the 
marginal cost curve.
3Incremental profit is again /H9004p=/H9004R-/H9004C, but /H9004R is given by the price to each customer (i.e., the 
average revenue curve), so /H9004p=AR -MC. Variable profit is the sum of these /H9004ps and is given by 
the area between the AR and MC curves.CHAPTER 11   •  Pricing with Market Power  403
it probably would not receive honest answers. After all, it is in the customers’ 
interest to claim that they would pay very little.
Sometimes, however, firms can discriminate imperfectly by charging a few 
 different prices based on estimates of customers’ reservation prices. This practice is often used by professionals, such as doctors, lawyers, accountants, or architects, who know their clients reasonably well. In such cases, the client’s willingness to pay can be assessed and fees set accordingly. For example, a doctor may offer a reduced fee to a low-income patient whose willingness to pay or insurance cov-erage is low, but charge higher fees to upper-income or better-insured patients. And an accountant, having just completed a client’s tax returns, is in an excellent position to estimate how much the client is willing to pay for the service.
Another example is a car salesperson, who typically works with a 15-percent 
profit margin. The salesperson can give part of this margin away to the customer by making a “deal,” or can insist that the customer pay the full sticker price. A good salesperson knows how to size up customers: A customer who is likely to look elsewhere for a car is given a large discount (from the salesperson’s point of view, a small profit is better than no sale and no profit), but the customer in a hurry is offered little or no discount. In other words, a successful car salesperson 
knows how to price discriminate!
Still another example is college and university tuition. Colleges don’t charge dif-
ferent tuition rates to different students in the same degree programs. Instead, they offer financial aid, in the form of scholarships or subsidized loans, which reduces the net tuition that the student must pay. By requiring those who seek aid to dis-
close information about family income and wealth, colleges can link the amount of aid to ability (and hence willingness) to pay. Thus students who are financially well off pay more for their education, while students who are less well off pay less.
Figure 11.3 illustrates imperfect first-degree price discrimination. If only a sin-
gle price were charged, it would be P
4*. Instead, six different prices are charged, 
the lowest of which, P6, is set at about the point where marginal cost intersects the 
demand curve. Note that those customers who would not have been willing to pay a price of P
4* or greater are actually better off in this  situation—they are now 
in the market and may be enjoying at least some consumer surplus. In fact, if price

FIRST-DEGREE PRICE DISCRIMINATION IN 
PRACTICE
Firms usually don’t know the reservation price of 
 every consumer, but sometimes reservation prices can 
be roughly identified. Here, six different prices are charged. The firm earns higher profits, but some con-sumers may also benefit. With a single price 
P4*, there 
are fewer consumers. The consumers who now pay P5 
or P6 enjoy a surplus.404  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
discrimination brings enough new customers into the market, consumer welfare 
can increase to the point that both the producer and consumers are better off.
Second-Degree Price Discrimination
In some markets, as each consumer purchases many units of a good over any given period, his reservation price declines with the number of units purchased. Examples include water, heating fuel, and electricity. Consumers may each pur-chase a few hundred kilowatt-hours of electricity a month, but their willingness to pay declines with increasing consumption. The first 100 kilowatt-hours may be worth a lot to the consumer—operating a refrigerator and providing for minimal  
lighting. Conservation becomes easier with the additional units and may be worth-while if the price is high. In this situation, a firm can discriminate according to the quantity consumed. This is called second-degree price discrimination,  and it works 
by charging different prices for different quantities of the same good or service.
Quantity discounts are an example of second-degree price discrimination. A 
single light bulb might be priced at $5, while a box containing four of the same bulb might be priced at $14, making the average price per bulb $3.50. Similarly, the price per ounce for breakfast cereal is likely to be smaller for the 24-ounce box than for the 16-ounce box.
Another example of second-degree price discrimination is block pricing  by 
electric power companies, natural gas utilities, and municipal water compa-nies. With block pricing,  the consumer is charged different prices for different 
quantities or “blocks” of a good. If scale economies cause average and marginal costs to decline, the government agency that controls rates may encourage block pricing. Because it leads to expanded output and greater scale economies, this policy can increase consumer welfare while allowing for greater profit to the company: While prices are reduced overall, the savings from the lower unit cost still permits the company to increase its profit.
Figure 11.4 illustrates second-degree price discrimination for a firm with 
declining average and marginal costs. If a single price were charged, it would be P
0, and the quantity produced would be Q0. Instead, three different prices are 
charged, based on the quantities purchased. The first block of sales is priced at P
1, the second at P2, and the third at P3.
Third-Degree Price Discrimination
A well-known liquor company has what seems to be a strange pricing prac-
tice. The company produces a vodka that it advertises as one of the smoothest and best-tasting available. This vodka is called “Three Star Golden Crown” and sells for about $16 a bottle.
4 However, the company also takes some of this same 
vodka and bottles it under the name “Old Sloshbucket,” which is sold for about $8 a bottle. Why does it do this? Has the president of the company been spend-ing too much time near the vats?
Perhaps, but this company is also practicing third-degree price discrimina-
tion,  and it does so because the practice is profitable. This form of price dis-
crimination divides consumers into two or more groups with separate demand curves for each group. It is the most prevalent form of price discrimination, and  examples abound: regular versus “special” airline fares; premium versus  nonpremium brands of liquor, canned food or frozen vegetables; discounts to students and senior citizens; and so on.• second-degree price

4We have changed the names to protect the innocent.CHAPTER 11   •  Pricing with Market Power  405
CREATING CONSUMER GROUPS  In each case, some characteristic is used to 
divide consumers into distinct groups. For many goods, for example, students and senior citizens are usually willing to pay less on average than the rest of the population (because their incomes are lower), and identity can be readily established (via a college ID or driver’s license). Likewise, to separate vacation-ers from business travelers (whose companies are usually willing to pay higher fares), airlines can put restrictions on special low-fare tickets, such as requiring advance purchase or a Saturday night stay. With the liquor company, or the pre-mium versus nonpremium (e.g., supermarket label) brand of food, the label itself divides consumers; many consumers are willing to pay more for a name brand even though the nonpremium brand is identical or nearly identical (and might be manufactured by the same company that produced the premium brand).
If third-degree price discrimination is feasible, how should the firm decide 
what price to charge each group of consumers? Let’s think about this in two steps.
 1. We know that however much is produced, total output should be divided 
between the groups of customers so that marginal revenues for each group are equal. Otherwise, the firm would not be maximizing profit. For exam-ple, if there are two groups of customers and the marginal revenue for the first group, MR
1, exceeds the marginal revenue for the second group, MR2, 
the firm could clearly do better by shifting output from the second group to the first. It would do this by lowering the price to the first group and raising the price to the second group. Thus, whatever the two prices, they must be such that the marginal revenues for the different groups are equal.
 2. We know that total output must be such that the marginal revenue for each 
group of consumers is equal to the marginal cost of production. Again, if this were not the case, the firm could increase its profit by raising or lowering total output (and lowering or raising its prices to both groups). For example, suppose that marginal revenues were the same for each group of consumers but that marginal revenue exceeded marginal cost. The firm could then make P2

SECOND-DEGREE PRICE  
DISCRIMINATION
Different prices are charged for dif-
ferent quantities, or “blocks,” of the same good. Here, there are three blocks, with corresponding prices P
1, 
P2, and P3. There are also economies 
of scale, and average and marginal costs are declining. Second-degree price discrimination can then make consumers better off by expanding output and lowering cost.406  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
a greater profit by increasing its total output. It would lower its prices to both 
groups of consumers, so that marginal revenues for each group would fall (but would still be equal to each other) and would approach marginal cost.
Let’s look at this problem algebraically. Let P
1 be the price charged to the first 
group of consumers, P2 the price charged to the second group, and C(QT) the 
total cost of producing output QT /H11005 Q1 /H11001 Q2. Total profit is then
p=P1Q1+P2Q2-C(QT)
The firm should increase its sales to each group of consumers, Q1 and Q2, until 
the incremental profit from the last unit sold is zero. First, we set incremental profit for sales to the first group of consumers equal to zero:
/H9004p
/H9004Q1=/H9004(P1Q1)
/H9004Q1 - /H9004C
/H9004Q1 =0
Here, /H9004(P1Q1)//H9004Q1 is the incremental revenue from an extra unit of sales to the 
first group of consumers (i.e., MR1). The next term, /H9004C//H9004Q1, is the incremental 
cost of producing this extra unit—i.e., marginal cost, MC. We thus have
MR 1=MC
Similarly, for the second group of consumers, we must have
MR 2=MC
Putting these relations together, we see that prices and output must be set so that
 MR 1=MR 2=MC (11.1)
Again, marginal revenue must be equal across groups of consumers and must 
equal marginal cost.
DETERMINING RELATIVE PRICES  Managers may find it easier to think in 
terms of the relative prices that should be charged to each group of consumers and to relate these prices to the elasticities of demand. Recall from Section 10.1 that we can write marginal revenue in terms of the elasticity of demand:
MR=P(1+1/E
d)
Thus MR1  /H11005 P1(1 /H11001 1/E1) and MR2 /H11005 P2(1 /H11001 1/E2), where E1 and E2 are the 
elasticities of demand for the firm’s sales in the first and second markets, respec-tively. Now equating MR
1 and MR2 as in equation (11.1) gives the following rela-
tionship that must hold for the prices:
 P1
P2=(1+1/E2)
(1+1/E1) (11.2)In our discussion of a rule of 
thumb for pricing in §10.1, we explained that a profit-maximizing firm chooses an output at which its marginal revenue is equal to the price of the product plus the ratio of the price to the price elas-ticity of demand.CHAPTER 11   •  Pricing with Market Power  407
As you would expect, the higher price will be charged to consumers with the 
lower demand elasticity. For example, if the elasticity of demand for consumers in group 1 is /H110022 and the elasticity for consumers in group 2 is /H110024, we will have 
P
1/P2=(1-1/4)/(1 -1/2)=(3/4)/(1/2) =1.5. In other words, the price 
charged to the first group of consumers should be 1.5 times as high as the price charged to the second group.
Figure 11.5 illustrates third-degree price discrimination. Note that the demand 
curve D
1 for the first group of consumers is less elastic than the curve for the second 
group; thus the price charged to the first group is higher. The total quantity pro-duced, Q
T /H11005 Q1 /H11001 Q2, is found by summing the marginal revenue curves MR1 and 
MR2 horizontally, which yields the dashed curve MRT, and finding its intersection 
with the marginal cost curve. Because MC must equal MR1 and MR2, we can draw 
a horizontal line leftward from this intersection to find the quantities Q1 and Q2.
It may not always be worthwhile for the firm to try to sell to more than one 
group of consumers. In particular, if demand is small for the second group and marginal cost is rising steeply, the increased cost of producing and selling to this group may outweigh the increase in revenue. In Figure 11.6, the firm is better off charging a single price P* and selling only to the larger group of consumers: The 
additional cost of serving the smaller market would outweigh the additional revenue that might come from selling to it.

Consumers are divided into two groups, with separate demand curves for each group. The 
 optimal prices and quantities are such that the marginal revenue from each group is the same 
and equal to marginal cost. Here group 1, with demand curve D1, is charged P1, and group 2, 
with the more elastic demand curve D2, is charged the lower price P2. Marginal cost depends

EXAMPLE 11.1  THE ECONOMICS OF COUPONS AND REBATES
Producers of processed foods and 
related consumer goods often issue coupons that let customers buy products at discounts. These coupons are usually distributed as part of an advertisement for the product. They may appear in newspapers or magazines or in promotional mailings. For exam-ple, a coupon for a particular breakfast cereal might be worth 50 cents toward the purchase of a box of the cereal. Why do firms issue these coupons? Why not just lower the price of the product and thereby save the costs of printing and collecting the coupons?
Coupons provide a means of price discrimination. 
Studies show that only about 20 to 30 percent of all consumers regularly bother to clip, save, and use coupons. These consumers tend to be more sensi-tive to price than those who ignore coupons. They generally have more price-elastic demands and lower reservation prices. By issuing coupons, there-fore, a cereal company can separate its customers into two groups and, in effect, charge the more price-sensitive customers a lower 
price than the other customers.
Rebate programs work the same 
way. For example, Hewlett-Packard ran a program in which a consumer could mail in a form together with the proof of purchase of an  ink-jet 
printer and receive a rebate of $10.00. Why not just lower the price of the printer by $10.00? Because only those consumers 
with relatively price-sensitive demands bother to send in the materials and request rebates. Again, the program is a means of price discrimination.
Can consumers really be divided into distinct 
groups in this way? Table 11.1 shows the results of a statistical study in which, for a variety of prod-ucts, price elasticities of demand were estimated for users and nonusers of coupons.
5 This study 
confirms that users of coupons tend to have more price-sensitive demands. It also shows the extent to which the elasticities differ for the two groups of consumers and how the difference varies from one product to another.
5The study is by Chakravarthi Narasimhan, “A Price Discrimination Theory of Coupons,” Marketing 
Science  (Spring 1984). A recent study of coupons for breakfast cereals finds that contrary to the pre-
dictions of the price-discrimination model, shelf prices for cereals tend to be lower during peri-ods when coupons are more widely available. This might occur because couponing spurs more price competition among cereal manufacturers.

NO SALES TO SMALLER MARKET
Even if third-degree price discrimination is feasible, 
it may not pay to sell to both groups of consumers if marginal cost is rising. Here the first group of con-sumers, with demand D
1, are not willing to pay much 
for the product. It is unprofitable to sell to them be-cause the price would have to be too low to compen-sate for the resulting increase in marginal cost.CHAPTER 11   •  Pricing with Market Power  409
By themselves, these elasticity estimates do not 
tell a firm what price to set and how large a discount to offer because they pertain to market demand , 
not to the demand for the firm’s particular brand. For example, Table 11.1 indicates that the elastic-ity of demand for cake mix is −0.21 for nonusers of coupons and −0.43 for users. But the elasticity of demand for any of the five or six major brands of cake mix on the market will be much larger than either of these numbers—about five or six times as large, as a 
rule of thumb.
6 So for any one brand of cake mix—
say, Pillsbury—the elasticity of demand for users of coupons might be about −2.4, versus about −1.2 for nonusers. From equation (11.2), therefore, we can determine that the price to nonusers of coupons should be about 1.5 times the price to users. In other words, if a box of cake mix sells for $3.00, the com-pany should offer coupons that give a $1.00 discount.
6This rule of thumb applies if interfirm competition can be described by the Cournot model, which 
we will discuss in Chapter 12.EXAMPLE 11.2  AIRLINE FARES
Travelers are often amazed at the variety of fares 
available for round-trip flights from New York to Los Angeles. Recently, for example, the first-class fare was around $2000; the regular (unrestricted) econ-omy fare was about $1000, and special discount fares (often requiring the purchase of a ticket two weeks in advance and/or a Saturday night stayover) could be bought for as little as $200. Although first-
class service is not the same as economy service with a minimum stay requirement, the difference would not seem to warrant a price that is so much higher. Why do airlines set such fares?
These fares provide a profitable form of price 
discrimination. The gains from discriminating are TABLE 11.1  PRICE ELASTICITIES OF DEMAND FOR USERS

11.3   Intertemporal Price Discrimination 
and Peak-Load Pricing
Two other closely related forms of price discrimination are important and 
widely practiced. The first of these is intertemporal price discrimination:  sep-
arating consumers with different demand functions into different groups by charging different prices at different points in time. The second is peak-load 
pricing:  charging higher prices during peak periods when capacity constraints 
cause marginal costs to be high. Both of these strategies involve charging differ-ent prices at different times, but the reasons for doing so are somewhat different in each case. We will take each in turn.• intertemporal price 
discrimination  Practice of 
separating consumers with different demand functions into different groups by charging different prices at different points in time.
• peak-load pricing  Practice 
of charging higher prices during peak periods when capacity constraints cause marginal costs to be high.large because different types of customers, with 
very  different elasticities of demand, purchase 
these different types of tickets. Table 11.2 shows price (and income) elasticities of demand for three categories of service within the United States: first class, unrestricted coach, and discounted tickets (which often have restrictions and may be partly nonrefundable).
Note that the demand for discounted fares is 
about two or three times as price elastic as first-class or unrestricted coach service. Why the differ-ence? While discounted tickets are usually used by families and other leisure travelers, first-class and unrestricted coach tickets are more often bought by business travelers, who have little choice about when they travel and whose companies pick up the tab. Of course, these elasticities pertain to mar-ket demand, and with several airlines competing for customers, the elasticities of demand for each  airline will be larger. But the relative  sizes of elastici-
ties across the three categories of service should be about the same. When elasticities of demand differ so widely, it should not be surprising that airlines set such different fares for different categories of service.
Airline price discrimination has become increas-
ingly sophisticated. A wide variety of fares is available, depending on how far in advance the ticket is bought, the percentage of the fare that is refundable if the trip is changed or cancelled, and whether the trip includes a weekend stay.
7 The 
objective of the airlines has been to discriminate more finely among travelers with different reserva-tion prices. As one industry executive puts it, “You don’t want to sell a seat to a guy for $69 when he is willing to pay $400.”
8 At the same time, an 
airline would rather sell a seat for $69 than leave it empty.
7Airlines also allocate the number of seats on each flight that will be available for each fare category. 
The allocation is based on the total demand and mix of passengers expected for each flight, and can change as the departure of the flight nears and estimates of demand and passenger mix change.

Intertemporal Price Discrimination
The objective of intertemporal price discrimination is to divide consumers into 
high-demand and low-demand groups by charging a price that is high at first but falls later. To see how this strategy works, think about how an electronics company might price new, technologically advanced equipment, such as high-performance digital cameras or LCD television monitors. In Figure 11.7, D
1 is the 
(inelastic) demand curve for a small group of consumers who value the product highly and do not want to wait to buy it (e.g., photography buffs who want the latest camera). D
2 is the demand curve for the broader group of consumers who 
are more willing to forgo the product if the price is too high. The strategy, then, is to offer the product initially at the high price P
1, selling mostly to consumers 
on demand curve D1. Later, after this first group of consumers has bought the 
product, the price is lowered to P2, and sales are made to the larger group of 
consumers on demand curve D2.9
There are other examples of intertemporal price discrimination. One involves 
charging a high price for a first-run movie and then lowering the price after the movie has been out a year. Another, practiced almost universally by publish-ers, is to charge a high price for the hardcover edition of a book and then to release the paperback version at a much lower price about a year later. Many people think that the lower price of the paperback is due to a much lower cost of production, but this is not true. Once a book has been edited and typeset, the 
9The prices of new electronic products also come down over time because costs fall as producers 
start to achieve greater scale economies and move down the learning curve. But even if costs did not fall, producers can make more money by first setting high prices and then reducing them over time, thereby discriminating and capturing consumer surplus.$/Q

INTERTEMPORAL PRICE DISCRIMINATION
Consumers are divided into groups by changing the price over time. Initially, the price is 
high. The firm captures surplus from consumers who have a high demand for the good and who are unwilling to wait to buy it. Later the price is reduced to appeal to the mass market.412  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
marginal cost of printing an additional copy, whether hardcover or paperback, 
is quite low, perhaps a dollar or so. The paperback version is sold for much less not because it is much cheaper to print but because high-demand consumers have already purchased the hardbound edition. The remaining consumers—paperback buyers—generally have more elastic demands.
Peak-Load Pricing
Peak-load pricing also involves charging different prices at different points in time. Rather than capturing consumer surplus, however, the objective is to increase eco-nomic efficiency by charging consumers prices that are close to marginal cost.
For some goods and services, demand peaks at particular times—for roads 
and tunnels during commuter rush hours, for electricity during late summer afternoons, and for ski resorts and amusement parks on weekends. Marginal cost is also high during these peak periods because of capacity constraints. Prices should thus be higher during peak periods.
This is illustrated in Figure 11.8, where D
1 is the demand curve for the peak 
period and D2 the demand curve for the nonpeak period. The firm sets marginal 
revenue equal to marginal cost for each period, obtaining the high price P1 for the 
peak period and the lower price P2 for the nonpeak period, selling corresponding 
quantities Q1 and Q2. This strategy increases the firm’s profit above what it would 
be if it charged one price for all periods. It is also more efficient: The sum of pro-ducer and consumer surplus is greater because prices are closer to marginal cost.
The efficiency gain from peak-load pricing is important. If the firm were a 
regulated monopolist (e.g., an electric utility), the regulatory agency should set the prices P
1 and P2 at the points where the demand  curves, D1 and D2, intersect 
the marginal cost curve, rather than where the marginal revenue curves inter-sect marginal cost. In that case, consumers realize the entire efficiency gain.
Note that peak-load pricing is different from third-degree price discrimina-
tion. With third-degree price discrimination, marginal revenue must be equal for In §9.2, we explain that 
economic efficiency means that aggregate consumer and producer surplus is  maximized.

10Some consumers will buy the hardbound edition even if the paperback is already available because 
it is more durable and more attractive on a bookshelf. This must be taken into account when setting prices, but it is of secondary importance compared with intertemporal price discrimination.EXAMPLE 11.3  HOW TO PRICE A BEST-SELLING NOVEL
Publishing both hardbound and 
paperback editions of a book allows publishers to price discriminate. As they do with most goods, con-sumers differ considerably in their willingness to pay for books. For example, some consumers want to buy a new bestseller as soon as it is released, even if the price is $25. Other consumers, however, will wait a year until the book is available in paperback for $10. But how does a publisher decide that $25 is the right price for the new hardbound edition and $10 is the right price for the paperback edition? And how long should it wait before bringing out the paperback edition?
The key is to divide consumers into two groups, so 
that those who are willing to pay a high price do so and only those unwilling to pay a high price wait and 
buy the paperback. This means that significant time must be allowed to pass before the paperback is released. If consumers know that the paperback will be available within a few months, they will have little incentive to buy the hardbound 
edition.
10 On the other hand, if the 
publisher waits too long to bring out the paperback edition, inter-est will wane and the market will dry up. As a result, publishers typi-cally wait 12 to 18 months before releasing paperback editions.
What about price? Setting the 
price of the hardbound edition is difficult: Except for a few authors whose books always seem to sell, publishers have little data with which to estimate demand for a book that is about to be published. Often, they can judge only from the past sales of similar books. But usually only aggregate data are available for each category of book. Most new nov-els, therefore, are released at similar prices. It is clear, however, that those consumers willing to wait for the paperback edition have demands that are far more elastic than those of bibliophiles. It is not surprising, then, that paperback editions sell for so much less than hardbacks.
11
each group of consumers and equal to marginal cost. Why? Because the costs of serving the different groups are not independent. For example, with unrestricted versus discounted air fares, increasing the number of seats sold at discounted fares affects the cost of selling unrestricted tickets—marginal cost rises rapidly as the airplane fills up. But this is not so with peak-load pricing (or for that matter, with most instances of intertemporal price discrimination). Selling more tickets for ski lifts or amusement parks on a weekday does not significantly raise the cost of selling tickets on the weekend. Similarly, selling more electricity during off-peak periods will not significantly increase the cost of selling electricity during peak periods. As a result, price and sales in each period can be determined inde-pendently by setting marginal cost equal to marginal revenue for each period.
Movie theaters, which charge more for evening shows than for matinees, are 
another example. For most movie theaters, the marginal cost of serving customers during the matinee is independent of marginal cost during the evening. The owner of a movie theater can determine the optimal prices for the evening and matinee shows independently, using estimates of demand and marginal cost in each period.
11Hardbound and paperback editions are often published by different companies. The author’s 
agent auctions the rights to the two editions, but the contract for the paperback specifies a delay to protect the sales of the hardbound edition. The principle still applies, however. The length of the delay and the prices of the two editions are chosen to price discriminate intertemporally.414  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
11.4  The Two-Part Tariff
The two-part tariff  is related to price discrimination and provides another 
means of extracting consumer surplus. It requires consumers to pay a fee up front for the right to buy a product. Consumers then pay an additional fee for each unit of the product they wish to consume. The classic example of this strat-egy is an amusement park.
12 You pay an admission fee to enter, and you also pay 
a certain amount for each ride. The owner of the park must decide whether to charge a high entrance fee and a low price for the rides or, alternatively, to admit people for free but charge high prices for the rides.
The two-part tariff has been applied in many settings: tennis and golf clubs 
(you pay an annual membership fee plus a fee for each use of a court or round of golf); the rental of large mainframe computers (a flat monthly fee plus a fee for each unit of processing time consumed); telephone service (a monthly hook-up fee plus a fee for minutes of usage). The strategy also applies to the sale of prod-ucts like safety razors (you pay for the razor, which lets you consume the blades that fit that brand of razor).
The problem for the firm is how to set the entry fee  (which we denote by T) 
versus the usage fee  (which we denote by P). Assuming that the firm has some 
market power, should it set a high entry fee and low usage fee, or vice versa? To solve this problem, we need to understand the basic principles involved.
SINGLE CONSUMER  Let’s begin with the artificial but simple case illustrated 
in Figure 11.9. Suppose there is only one consumer in the market (or many con-sumers with identical demand curves). Suppose also that the firm knows this consumer’s demand curve. Now, remember that the firm wants to capture as much consumer surplus as possible. In this case, the solution is straightforward: Set the usage fee P equal to marginal cost and the entry fee T equal to the total 
consumer surplus for each consumer. Thus, the consumer pays T* (or a bit less) 
to use the product, and P* /H11005 MC per unit consumed. With the fees set in this 
way, the firm captures all the consumer surplus as its profit.• two-part tariff  Form of 
pricing in which consumers are charged both an entry and a usage fee.

a Mickey Mouse Monopoly,” Quarterly Journal of Economics  (February 1971): 77–96.MC

TWO CONSUMERS  Now suppose that there are two different consumers (or 
two groups of identical consumers). The firm, however, can set only one entry 
fee and one usage fee. It would thus no longer want to set the usage fee equal to marginal cost. If it did, it could make the entry fee no larger than the con-sumer surplus of the consumer with the smaller demand (or else it would lose that consumer), and this would not yield a maximum profit. Instead, the firm should set the usage fee above  marginal cost and then set the entry fee equal to 
the remaining consumer surplus of the consumer with the smaller demand.
Figure 11.10 illustrates this. With the optimal usage fee at P* greater than MC, 
the firm’s profit is 2 T* /H11001 (P* − MC)( Q
1 /H11001 Q2). (There are two consumers, and 
each pays T*.) You can verify that this profit is more than twice the area of trian-
gle ABC , the consumer surplus of the consumer with the smaller demand when 
P /H11005 MC. To determine the exact values of P* and T*, the firm would need to 
know (in addition to its marginal cost) the demand curves D1 and D2. It would 
then write down its profit as a function of P and T and choose the two prices that 
maximize this function. (See Exercise 10 for an example of how to do this.)
MANY CONSUMERS  Most firms, however, face a variety of consumers with dif-
ferent demands. Unfortunately, there is no simple formula to calculate the opti-mal two-part tariff in this case, and some trial-and-error experiments might be required. But there is always a trade-off: A lower entry fee means more entrants and thus more profit from sales of the item. On the other hand, as the entry fee becomes smaller and the number of entrants larger, the profit derived from the entry fee will fall. The problem, then, is to pick an entry fee that results in the optimum number of entrants—that is, the fee that allows for maximum profit. In principle, we can do this by starting with a price for sales of the item P, finding 
the optimum entry fee T, and then estimating the resulting profit. The price P is 
then changed, and the corresponding entry fee calculated, along with the new profit level. By iterating this way, we can approach the optimal two-part tariff.MC

Note that this profit is larger than twice the area of triangle ABC.416  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy

TWO-PART TARIFF WITH MANY DIFFERENT

Total profit p is the sum of the profit from the entry 
fee pa and the profit from sales ps. Both pa and ps 
depend on T, the entry fee. Therefore
p=pa+ps=n(T)T+(P-MC) Q(n)
where n is the number of entrants, which depends 
on the entry fee T, and Q is the rate of sales, which 
is greater the larger is n. Here T* is the profit-maxi-
mizing entry fee, given P. To calculate optimum val-
ues for P and T, we can start with a number for P, 
find the optimum T, and then estimate the resulting 
profit. P is then changed and the corresponding T 
recalculated, along with the new profit level.
Figure 11.11 illustrates this principle. The firm’s profit p is divided into two 
components, each of which is plotted as a function of the entry fee T, assuming 
a fixed sales price P. The first component, pa, is the profit from the entry fee and 
is equal to the revenue n(T)T, where n(T) is the number of entrants. (Note that 
a high T implies a small n.) Initially, as T is increased from zero, revenue n(T)T 
rises. Eventually, however, further increases in T will make n so small that n(T)T 
falls. The second component, ps, is the profit from sales of the item itself at price 
P and is equal to ( P − MC) Q, where Q is the rate at which entrants purchase 
the item. The larger the number of entrants n, the larger Q will be. Thus ps falls 
when T is increased because a higher T reduces n.
Starting with a number for P, we determine the optimal (profit-maximizing) 
T*. We then change P, find a new T*, and determine whether profit is now higher 
or lower. This procedure is repeated until profit has been maximized.
Obviously, more data are needed to design an optimal two-part tariff than 
to choose a single price. Knowing marginal cost and the aggregate demand curve is not enough. It is impossible (in most cases) to determine the demand curve of every consumer, but one would at least like to know by how much individual demands differ from one another. If consumers’ demands for your product are fairly similar, you would want to charge a price P that is close 
to marginal cost and make the entry fee T large. This is the ideal situation 
from the firm’s point of view because most of the consumer surplus could then be captured. On the other hand, if consumers have different demands for your product, you would probably want to set P well above marginal cost and 
charge a lower entry fee T. In that case, however, the two-part tariff is a less 
effective means of capturing consumer surplus; setting a single price may do almost as well.
At Disneyland in California and Walt Disney World in Florida, the strategy 
is to charge a high entry fee and charge nothing for the rides. This policy makes sense because consumers have reasonably similar demands for Disney vaca-tions. Most people visiting the parks plan daily budgets (including expenditures for food and beverages) that, for most consumers, do not differ very much.CHAPTER 11   •  Pricing with Market Power  417
EXAMPLE 11.4   PRICING CELLULAR PHONE SERVICE
Most telephone service is 
priced using a two-part tariff: a monthly access fee, which may include some free minutes, plus a  per-minute charge for addi-
tional minutes. This is also true for cellular phone service, which has grown explosively, both in the United States and around the world. In the case of cellular service, providers have taken the two-part tariff and turned it into an art form.
In most parts of the United States, consumers can 
choose among four national network providers—Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T, and Sprint. These provid-ers compete among themselves for customers, but each has some market power. This market power arises in part from oligopolistic pricing and output decisions, as we will explain in Chapters 12 and 13. Market power also arises because consumers face switching costs : When they sign up for a cellular 
plan, they must typically make a commitment to stay for at least one year, and breaking the contract is quite expensive. Most service  providers impose a 
penalty upwards of $200 for early  termination.
Because providers have market power, they must 
think carefully about profit-maximizing pricing strat-egies. The two-part tariff provides an ideal means by which cellular providers can  capture consumer 
surplus and turn it into profit.
Table 11.3 shows cellular rate plans (for 2011) 
offered by Verizon Wireless, Sprint, and AT&T, as well as Orange (a subsidiary of France Telecom that operates in several countries) and China Mobile. Note that all of these cellular providers give  consumers a choice of alternative 
two-part tariffs, and the plans are structured in similar ways.
Let’s focus on the Verizon 
plans. The least expensive Verizon plan has a monthly access charge of $39.99 and includes 450 “anytime” minutes (i.e., 450 minutes of talk time per month that can be used at any hour of the day). The plan also includes an unlimited amount of talk time during nights and week-
ends (periods when demand is generally lower). A subscriber who uses more than the 450 “anytime” minutes is charged $0.45 for each additional min-ute. A customer who uses her cell phone more fre-quently could sign up for a more expensive plan, e.g., one that costs $59.99 per month but includes 900 “anytime” minutes and a charge of $0.40 for additional minutes. And if you, the reader, use your cell phone constantly (and thus have time for little else), you could sign up for a plan that includes unlimited “anytime” minutes, at a monthly cost of $69.99.
Why do cellular phone providers offer several 
different types of plans and options within each? Why don’t they simply offer a single two-part  tariff 
with a monthly access charge and a per-minute usage charge? Offering several different plans and options allows companies to combine third-degree price discrimination with the two-part tariff. The plans are structured so that consumers sort themselves into groups based on their plan choices. A different  two-part tariff is then applied 
to each group.
Firms are perpetually searching for innovative pricing strategies, and a few 
have devised and introduced a two-part tariff with a “twist”—the entry fee T 
entitles the customer to a certain number of free units. For example, if you buy a Gillette razor, several blades are usually included in the package. The monthly lease fee for a mainframe computer usually includes some free usage before usage is charged. This twist lets the firm set a higher entry fee T without los-
ing as many small customers. Because these small customers might pay little or nothing for usage under this scheme, the higher entry fee will capture their surplus without driving them out of the market, while also capturing more of the surplus of the large customers.418  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
To see how this sorting works, consider the 
plan choices of different types of consumers. People who use a cell phone only occasionally will want to spend as little as possible on the service and will choose the least expensive plan (with the fewest “anytime” minutes). The most expensive plans are best suited to very heavy users (perhaps a salesperson who travels exten-
sively and makes call throughout the day), who will want to minimize their per-minute cost. Other plans are better suited to consumers with moder-ate calling needs.
Consumers will choose a plan that best matches 
their needs. Thus they will sort themselves into TABLE 11.3 CELLULAR RATE PLANS (2011)

*11.5  Bundling
You have probably seen the 1939 film Gone with the Wind.  It is a classic that is 
nearly as popular now as it was then.13 Yet we would guess that you have not 
seen Getting Gertie’s Garter , a flop that the same company (MGM, a division of 
Loews) also distributed. And we would also guess that you did not know that these two films were priced in what was then an unusual and  innovative way.
14
Movie theaters that leased Gone with the Wind  also had to lease Getting Gertie’s 
Garter.  (Movie theaters pay the film companies or their distributors a daily 
or weekly fee for the films they lease.) In other words, these two films were  bundled —i.e., sold as a package.
15 Why would the film company do this?
You might think that the answer is obvious: Gone with the Wind  was a great 
film and Gertie  was a lousy film, so bundling the two forced movie theaters to 
lease Gertie.  But this answer doesn’t make economic sense. Suppose a  theater’s 
reservation price (the maximum price it will pay) for Gone with the Wind  is $12,000 
per week, and its reservation price for Gertie  is $3000 per week. Then the most 
it would pay for both films is $15,000, whether it takes the films  individually or 
as a package.
Bundling makes sense when customers have heterogeneous demands  and when 
the firm cannot price discriminate. With films, different movie theaters serve different groups of patrons and therefore different theaters may face different demands for films. For example, different theaters might appeal to different age groups, who in turn have different relative film preferences.
To see how a film company can use customer heterogeneity to its advantage, 
suppose that there are two movie theaters and that their reservation prices for 
our two films are as follows:
GONE WITH THE WIND GETTING GERTIE’S GARTER
Theater A $12,000 $3000
Theater B $10,000 $4000• bundling  Practice of selling 
two or more products as a package.
13Adjusted for inflation, Gone with the Wind  was also the largest grossing film of all time. Titanic , 
released in 1997, made $601 million. Gone with the Wind  grossed $81.5 million in 1939 dollars, which 
is equivalent to $941 million in 1997 dollars.
14For those readers who claim to know all this, our final trivia question is: Who played the role of 
Gertie in Getting Gertie’s Garter ?
15The major Hollywood studios were forced to stop bundling their films in 1948, when the Supreme 
Court decided that the studios were acting in violation of antitrust laws by forcing theaters to buy their films on an all-or-nothing basis. In addition, the studios were forced to sell their theater chains, ending decades of monopolistic vertical integration that had made the studios economic powerhouses.groups, and the consumers in each group will be 
relatively homogeneous in terms of demands for cellular service. Remember that the two-part tar-iff works best when consumers have identical or very similar demands. (Recall from Figure 11.9 that with identical consumers, the two-part tariff can be 
used to capture all consumer surplus.) Creating a 
situation in which consumers sort themselves into groups in this way makes best use of the two-part tariff.420  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
If the films are rented separately, the maximum price that could be charged for 
Wind  is $10,000 because charging more would exclude Theater B. Similarly, the 
maximum price that could be charged for Gertie  is $3000. Charging these two prices 
would yield $13,000 from each theater, for a total of $26,000 in revenue. But suppose the films are bundled.  Theater A values the pair of films at $15,000 ($12,000 /H11001 $3000), 
and Theater B values the pair at $14,000 ($10,000 /H11001 $4000). Therefore, we can charge 
each theater $14,000 for the pair of films and earn a total revenue of $28,000. Clearly, we can earn more revenue ($2000 more) by bundling the films.
Relative Valuations
Why is bundling more profitable than selling the films separately? Because (in this example) the relative valuations  of the two films are reversed. In other words, 
although both theaters would pay much more for Wind  than for Gertie , Theater 
A would pay more than Theater B for Wind  ($12,000 vs. $10,000), while Theater 
B would pay more than Theater A for Gertie  ($4000 vs. $3000). In technical terms, 
we say that the demands are negatively correlated —the customer willing to pay 
the most for Wind  is willing to pay the least for Gertie.  To see why this is critical, 
suppose demands were positively correlated —that is, Theater A would pay more 
for both films:
GONE WITH THE WIND GETTING GERTIE’S GARTER
Theater A $12,000 $4000
Theater B $10,000 $3000
The most that Theater A would pay for the pair of films is now $16,000, but the 
most that Theater B would pay is only $13,000. Thus if we bundled the films, the 
maximum price that could be charged for the package is $13,000, yielding a total revenue of $26,000, the same as by renting the films  separately.
Now, suppose a firm is selling two different goods to many consumers. To 
analyze the possible advantages of bundling, we will use a simple diagram to describe the preferences of the consumers in terms of their reservation prices and their consumption decisions given the prices charged. In Figure 11.12 the horizontal axis is r

The reservation prices of consumers in region I exceed the

FIGURE 11.14
CONSUMPTION DECISIONS WHEN PRODUCTS ARE 
BUNDLED
Consumers compare the sum of their reservation  prices r1 + r2, 
with the price of the bundle PB. They buy the  bundle only if r1 + r2 
is at least as large as PB.the vertical axis is r2, which is the reservation price for good 2. The figure shows 
the reservation prices for three consumers. Consumer A is willing to pay up to 
$3.25 for good 1 and up to $6 for good 2; consumer B is willing to pay up to $8.25 
for good 1 and up to $3.25 for good 2; and consumer C is willing to pay up to 
$10 for each of the goods. In general, the reservation prices for any number of consumers can be plotted this way.
Suppose that there are many consumers and that the products are sold sepa-
rately, at prices P
1 and P2, respectively. Figure 11.13 shows how consumers can 
be divided into groups. Consumers in region I of the graph have  reservation prices that are above the prices being charged for each of the goods, so they will buy both goods. Consumers in region II have a reservation price for good 2 that is above P
2, but a reservation price for good 1 that is below P1; they will buy only 
good 2. Similarly, consumers in region IV will buy only good 1. Finally, consum-ers in region III have reservation prices below the prices charged for each of the goods, and so will buy neither.
Now suppose the goods are sold only as a bundle, for a total price of P
B. 
We can then divide the graph into two regions, as in Figure 11.14. Any given 422  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
 consumer will buy the bundle only if its price is less than or equal to the sum of 
that consumer’s reservation prices for the two goods. The dividing line is there-fore the equation P
B /H11005 r1 /H11001 r2 or, equivalently, r2 /H11005 PB − r1. Consumers in region I 
have reservation prices that add up to more than PB, so they will buy the bundle. 
Consumers in region II, who have reservation prices that add up to less than PB, 
will not buy the bundle.
Depending on the prices, some of the consumers in region II of Figure 11.14 
might have bought one of the goods if they had been sold separately. These con-sumers are lost to the firm, however, when it sells the goods only as a bundle. The firm, then, must determine whether it can do better by bundling.
In general, the effectiveness of bundling depends on the extent to which 
demands are negatively correlated. In other words, it works best when consum-ers who have a high reservation price for good 1 have a low reservation price for good 2, and vice versa. Figure 11.15 shows two extremes. In part (a), each point represents the two reservation prices of a consumer. Note that the demands for the two goods are perfectly positively correlated—consumers with a high  reservation price for good 1 also have a high reservation price for good 2. If the firm bundles and charges a price P
B /H11005 P1 /H11001 P2, it will make the same profit that 
it would make by selling the goods separately at prices P1 and P2. In part (b), on 
the other hand, demands are perfectly negatively correlated—a higher reserva-tion price for good 2 implies a proportionately lower one for good 1. In this case, bundling is the ideal strategy. By charging the price P
B the firm can capture all 
the consumer surplus.
Figure 11.16, which shows the movie example that we introduced at the 
beginning of this section, illustrates how the demands of the two movie theaters are negatively correlated. (Theater A will pay relatively more for Gone with the

makes it more profitable to rent the films as a bundle priced at $14,000.
Mixed Bundling
So far, we have assumed that the firm has two options: to sell the goods either separately or as a bundle. But there is a third option, called mixed bundling.  As 
the name suggests, the firm offers its products both separately and as a bundle, 
with a package price below the sum of the individual prices. (We use the term pure bundling  to refer to the strategy of selling the products only as a bundle.) 
Mixed bundling is often the ideal strategy when demands are only somewhat negatively correlated and/or when marginal production costs are significant. (Thus far, we have assumed that marginal production costs are zero.)
In Figure 11.17, mixed bundling is the most profitable strategy. Although 
demands are perfectly negatively correlated, there are significant marginal costs. (The marginal cost of producing good 1 is $20, and the marginal cost of producing good 2 is $30.) We have four consumers, labeled A through D. Now, 
let’s compare three strategies:
 1. Selling the goods separately at prices P
1 /H11005 $50 and P2 /H11005 $90
 2. Selling the goods only as a bundle at a price of $100
 3. Mixed bundling, whereby the goods are offered separately at prices 
P1 /H11005 P2 /H11005 $89.95, or as a bundle at a price of $100.
Table 11.4 shows these three strategies and the resulting profits. (You can try 
other prices for P1, P2, and PB to verify that those given in the table maximize 
profit for each strategy.) When the goods are sold separately, only consumers B, 
C, and D buy good 1, and only consumer A buys good 2; total profit is 3($50 − 
$20) /H11001 1($90 − $30) /H11005 $150. With pure bundling, all four consumers buy the 
bundle for $100, so that total profit is 4($100 − $20 − $30) /H11005 $200. As we should 
expect, pure bundling is better than selling the goods separately because con-sumers’ demands are negatively correlated. But what about mixed bundling? • mixed bundling  Selling 
two or more goods both as a package and individually.
• pure bundling  Selling 
products only as a package.424  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
Consumer D buys only good 1 for $89.95, consumer A buys only good 2 for 
$89.95, and consumers B and C buy the bundle for $100. Total profit is now 
($89.95 − $20) /H11001 ($89.95 − $30) /H11001 2($100 − $20 − $30) /H11005 $229.90.16
In this case, mixed bundling is the most profitable strategy, even though 
demands are perfectly negatively correlated (i.e., all four consumers have  reservation prices on the line r
2 /H11005 100 − r1). Why? For each good, marginal 
 production cost exceeds the reservation price of one consumer. For example, consumer A has a reservation price of $90 for good 2 but a reservation price 
of only $10 for good 1. Because the cost of producing a unit of good 1 is $20, the firm would prefer that consumer A buy only good 2, not the bundle. It can 
achieve this goal by offering good 2 separately for a price just below consumer A’s reservation price, while also offering the bundle at a price acceptable to 
consumers B and C.
Mixed bundling would not be the preferred strategy in this example if 
 marginal costs were zero: In that case, there would be no benefit in excluding c1 /H11005 $20 $100

MIXED VERSUS PURE 
BUNDLING
With positive marginal costs, 
mixed bundling may be more profitable than pure bun-dling. Consumer A has a res-
ervation price for good 1 that is below marginal cost c
1, and 
consumer D has a reserva-
tion price for good 2 that is below marginal cost c
2. With 
mixed bundling, consumer A 
is induced to buy only good 2, and consumer D is induced 
to buy only good 1, thus  reducing the firm’s cost.
16Note that in the mixed bundling strategy, goods 1 and 2 are priced at $89.95 rather than at $90. If 
they were priced at $90, consumers A and D would be indifferent between buying a single good and 
buying the bundle, and if they buy the bundle, total profit will be lower.TABLE 11.4 BUNDLING EXAMPLE

consumer A from buying good 1 and consumer D from buying good 2. We leave 
it to you to demonstrate this (see Exercise 12).17
If marginal costs are zero, mixed bundling can still be more profitable than 
pure bundling if consumers’ demands are not perfectly negatively correlated. (Recall that in Figure 11.17, the reservation prices of the four consumers are  perfectly negatively correlated.) This is illustrated by Figure 11.18, in which we have modified the example of Figure 11.17. In Figure 11.18, marginal costs are zero, but the reservation prices for consumers B and C are now higher. Once 
again, let’s compare three strategies: selling the two goods separately, pure  bundling, and mixed bundling.
Table 11.5 shows the optimal prices and the resulting profits for each strat-
egy. (Once again, you should try other prices for P
1, P2, and PB to verify that 
those given in the table maximize profit for each strategy.) When the goods are sold separately, only consumers C and D buy good 1, and only consum-
ers A and B buy good 2; total profit is thus $320. With pure bundling, all four

product of another firm; see Richard L. Schmalensee, “Commodity Bundling by Single-Product Monopolies,” Journal of Law and Economics  25 (April 1982): 67–71. Bundling can also be profitable 
when the products are substitutes or complements. See Arthur Lewbel, “Bundling of Substitutes or Complements,” International Journal of Industrial Organization  3 (1985): 101–7.120 1009080 60 40 20 $10102040608090100$120

MIXED BUNDLING WITH ZERO MARGINAL 
COSTS
If marginal costs are zero, and if consumers’ demands are 
not perfectly negatively correlated, mixed bundling is still more profitable than pure bundling. In this example, con-sumers B and C are willing to pay $20 more for the bundle 
than are consumers A and D. With pure bundling, the price 
of the bundle is $100. With mixed bundling, the price of the bundle can be increased to $120 and consumers A and 
D can still be charged $90 for a single good.

Mixed bundling $90 $90 $120 $420426  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
consumers buy the bundle for $100, so that total profit is $400. As expected, 
pure bundling is better than selling the goods separately because consumers’ demands are negatively correlated. But mixed bundling is better still. With mixed bundling, consumer A buys only good 2, consumer D buys only good 
1, and consumers B and C buy the bundle at a price of $120. Total profit is 
now $420.
Why does mixed bundling give higher profits than pure bundling even 
though marginal costs are zero? The reason is that demands are not perfectly negatively correlated: The two consumers who have high demands for both goods ( B and C) are willing to pay more for the bundle than are consumers A 
and D. With mixed bundling, therefore, we can increase the price of the bundle 
(from $100 to $120), sell this bundle to two consumers, and charge the remaining consumers $90 for a single good.
Bundling in Practice
Bundling is a widely used pricing strategy. When you buy a new car, for  example, you can purchase such options as power windows, power seats, or a sunroof separately, or you can purchase a “luxury package” in which these options are bundled. Manufacturers of luxury cars (such as Lexus, BMW, or Infiniti) tend to include such “options” as standard equipment; this practice is pure bundling. For more moderately priced cars, however, these items are optional, but are usually offered as part of a bundle. Automobile companies must decide which items to include in such bundles and how to price them.
Another example is vacation travel. If you plan a vacation to Europe, you 
might make your own hotel reservations, buy an airplane ticket, and order a rental car. Alternatively, you might buy a vacation package in which airfare, land arrangements, hotels, and even meals are all bundled together.
Still another example is cable television. Cable operators typically offer a 
basic service for a low monthly fee, plus individual “premium” channels, such as Cinemax, Home Box Office, and the Disney Channel, on an individual basis for additional monthly fees. However, they also offer packages in which two or more premium channels are sold as a bundle. Bundling cable channels is profit-able because demands are negatively correlated. How do we know that? Given that there are only 24 hours in a day, the time that a consumer spends watching HBO is time that cannot be spent watching the Disney Channel. Thus consum-ers with high reservation prices for some channels will have relatively low res-ervation prices for others.
How can a company decide whether to bundle its products, and determine 
the profit-maximizing prices? Most companies do not know their customers’ reservation prices. However, by conducting market surveys, they may be able to estimate the distribution of reservation prices, and then use this information to design a pricing strategy.
This is illustrated in Figure 11.19. The dots are estimates of reservation prices 
or a representative sample of consumers (obtained, say, from a market survey). The company might first choose a price for the bundle, P
B, such that a diago-
nal line connecting these prices passes roughly midway through the dots in the figure. It could then try individual prices P
1 and P2. Given P1, P2, and PB, we 
can separate consumers into four regions, as shown in the figure. Consumers in Region I buy nothing (because r
1 < P1, r2 < P2, and r1 /H11001 r2 < PB). Consumers in 
Region II buy the bundle (because r1 /H11001 r2> PB). Consumers in Region III buy only 
good 2 (because r2> P2 but r1 < PB − P2). Likewise, consumers in Region IV buy 
only good 1. Given this distribution, we can calculate the resulting profits. We CHAPTER 11   •  Pricing with Market Power  427
can then raise or lower P1, P2, and PB and see whether doing so leads to higher 
profits. This can be done repeatedly (on a computer) until prices are found that roughly maximize total profit.r2

The dots in this figure are estimates of reservation prices 
for a representative sample of consumers. A company could first choose a price for the bundle, P
B, such that a diagonal 
line connecting these prices passes roughly midway through the dots. The company could then try individual prices P
1
and P2. Given P1, P2, and PB, profits can be calculated for 
this sample of consumers. Managers can then raise or low-er P
1, P2, and PB and see whether the new pricing leads to 
higher profits. This procedure is repeated until total profit is  roughly maximized.
EXAMPLE 11.5    THE COMPLETE DINNER VERSUS À LA CARTE: 
A RESTAURANT’S PRICING PROBLEM
Many restaurants offer both com-
plete dinners and à la carte menus. Why? Most customers go out to eat knowing roughly how much they are willing to spend for dinner (and choose the restaurant accord-ingly). Diners, however, have dif-ferent preferences. For example, some value appetizers highly but could happily skip dessert. Others attach little value to the appetizer but regard dessert as essential. And some customers attach moderate values to both appetizers and desserts. What pric-ing strategy lets the restaurant capture as much con-sumer surplus as possible from these heterogeneous customers? The answer, of course, is mixed bundling.
For a restaurant, mixed bundling means offering 
both complete dinners (the appetizer, main course, and dessert come as a package) and an à la carte menu (the customer buys the appetizer, 
main course, and dessert sepa-rately). This strategy allows the à la carte menu to be priced to capture consumer surplus from custom-ers who value some dishes much more highly than others. (Such cus-tomers would correspond to con-sumers A and D in Figure 11.17 
(page 424).) At the same time, the 
complete dinner retains those customers who have lower variations in their reservation prices for different dishes (e.g., customers who attach moderate values to both appetizers and desserts).
For example, if the restaurant expects to attract 
customers willing to spend about $20 for dinner, it might charge about $5 for appetizers, $14 for a typ-ical main dish, and $4 for dessert. It could also offer a complete dinner, which includes an  appetizer, 
428  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
main course, and dessert, for $20. Then, the cus-
tomer who loves dessert but couldn’t care less about an appetizer will order only the main dish and dessert, and spend $18 (saving the restaurant the cost of preparing an appetizer). At the same time, another customer who attaches a moderate value (say, $3 or $3.50) to both the appetizer and dessert will buy the complete dinner.
You don’t have to go an expensive French restau-
rant to experience mixed bundling. Table 11.6 shows the prices of some individual items at McDonald’s, as well as the prices of “super meals” that include meat or fish items along with a large order of French fries and a large soda. Note that you can buy a Big Mac, 
a large fries, and a large soda separately for a total of $9.27, or you can buy them as a bundle for $6.99. You say you don’t care for fries? Then just buy the Big Mac and large soda separately, for a total of $6.68, which is $0.31 less than the price of the bundle.
Unfortunately for consumers, perhaps, creative 
pricing is sometimes more important than creative cooking for the financial success of a restaurant. Successful restaurateurs know their customers’ demand characteristics and use that knowledge to design a pricing strategy that extracts as much  consumer surplus as possible.

Tying
Tying  is a general term that refers to any requirement that products be bought 
or sold in some combination. Pure bundling is a common form of tying, but tying can also take other forms. For example, suppose a firm sells a product (such as a copying machine) that requires the consumption of a secondary prod-uct (such as paper). The consumer who buys the first product is also required to buy the secondary product from the same company. This requirement is usu-ally imposed through a contract. Note that this is different from the examples of bundling discussed earlier. In those examples, the consumer might have been happy to buy just one of the products. In this case, however, the first product is useless without access to the secondary product.
Why might firms use this kind of pricing practice? One of the main benefits 
of tying is that it often allows a firm to meter demand  and thereby practice price 
discrimination more effectively. During the 1950s, for example, when Xerox had a monopoly on copying machines but not on paper, customers who leased Xerox • tying  Practice of requiring a 
customer to purchase one good in order to purchase another.CHAPTER 11   •  Pricing with Market Power  429
copiers also had to buy Xerox paper. This allowed Xerox to meter consumption 
(customers who used a machine intensively bought more paper), and thereby apply a two-part tariff to the pricing of its machines. Also during the 1950s, IBM required customers who leased its mainframe computers to use paper computer cards made only by IBM. By pricing cards well above marginal cost, IBM was effectively charg-ing higher prices for computer usage to customers with larger demands.
18
Tying can also be used to extend a firm’s market power. As we discussed in 
Example 10.8 (page 394), in 1998 the Department of Justice brought suit against Microsoft, claiming that the company had tied its Internet Explorer Web browser to its Windows 98 operating system in order to maintain its monopoly power in the market for PC operating systems.
Tying can have other uses. An important one is to protect customer good-
will connected with a brand name. This is why franchises are often required to purchase inputs from the franchiser. For example, Mobil Oil requires its service stations to sell only Mobil motor oil, Mobil batteries, and so on. Similarly, until recently, a McDonald’s franchisee had to purchase all materials and supplies—from the hamburgers to the paper cups—from McDonald’s, thus ensuring prod-uct uniformity and protecting the brand name.
19
*11.6  Advertising
We have seen how firms can utilize their market power when making pricing decisions. Pricing is important for a firm, but most firms with market power have another important decision to make: how much to advertise. In this sec-tion, we will see how firms with market power can make profit-maximizing advertising decisions, and how those decisions depend on the characteristics of demand for the firm’s product.
20
For simplicity, we will assume that the firm sets only one price for its product. 
We will also assume that having done sufficient market research, it knows how its quantity demanded depends on both its price P and  its advertising expendi-
tures in dollars A; that is, it knows Q(P,  A). Figure 11.20 shows the firm’s demand 
and cost curves with and without advertising. AR and MR are the firm’s average and marginal revenue curves when it does not advertise, and AC and MC are its average and marginal cost curves. It produces a quantity Q
0, where MR /H11005 MC, 
and receives a price P0. Its profit per unit is the difference between P0 and aver-
age cost, so its total profit p0 is given by the gray-shaded rectangle.
Now suppose the firm advertises. This causes its demand curve to shift out 
and to the right; the new average and marginal revenue curves are given by AR/H11032 and MR /H11032. Advertising is a fixed cost, so the firm’s average cost curve rises 
(to AC /H11032). Marginal cost, however, remains the same. With advertising, the firm 
produces Q
1 (where MR /H11032 /H11005 MC) and receives a price P1. Its total profit p1, given 
by the purple-shaded rectangle, is now much larger.
20A perfectly competitive firm has little reason to advertise: By definition it can sell as much as it 
produces at a market price that it takes as given. That is why it would be unusual to see a producer of corn or soybeans advertise.19In some cases, the courts have ruled that tying is not necessary to protect customer goodwill and is 
anticompetitive. Today, a McDonald’s franchisee can buy supplies from any McDonald’s-approved source. For a discussion of some of the antitrust issues involved in franchise tying, see Benjamin Klein and Lester F. Saft, “The Law and Economics of Franchise Tying Contracts,” Journal of Law and 
Economics  28 (May 1985): 345–61.18Antitrust actions ultimately forced IBM to discontinue this pricing practice.In §7.1, marginal cost—the 
increase in cost that results 
from producing one extra unit of output—is distin-guished from average cost—
the cost per unit of output.430  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
Although the firm in Figure 11.20 is clearly better off when it advertises, the fig-
ure does not help us determine how much  advertising it should do. It must choose its 
price P and advertising expenditure A to maximize profit, which is now given by:
p=PQ(P, A)-C(Q)-A
Given a price, more advertising will result in more sales and thus more 
 revenue. But what is the firm’s profit-maximizing advertising expenditure? You might be tempted to say that the firm should increase its advertising expendi-tures until the last dollar of advertising just brings forth an additional dollar of revenue—that is, until the marginal revenue from advertising, /H9004(PQ)//H9004A, 
is just equal to 1. But as Figure 11.20 shows, this reasoning omits an important element. Remember that advertising leads to increased output  (in the figure, output 
increased from Q
0 to Q1). But increased output in turn means increased produc-
tion costs, and this must be taken into account when comparing the costs and benefits of an extra dollar of advertising.
The correct decision is to increase advertising until the marginal revenue 
from an additional dollar of advertising, MR

EFFECTS OF ADVERTISING
AR and MR are average and marginal revenue when the firm doesn’t advertise, and AC and MC 
are average and marginal cost. The firm produces Q0 and receives a price P0. Its total profit p0 is 
given by the gray-shaded rectangle. If the firm advertises, its average and marginal revenue curves 
shift to the right. Average cost rises (to AC /H11032) but marginal cost remains the same. The firm now 
produces Q1 (where MR /H11032 = MC), and receives a price P1. Its total profit, p1, is now larger.CHAPTER 11   •  Pricing with Market Power  431
cost of that advertising. That full marginal cost is the sum of the dollar spent 
directly on the advertising and the marginal production cost resulting from the increased sales that advertising brings about. Thus the firm should advertise up to the point that
 MR

This rule is often ignored by managers, who justify advertising budgets by com-
paring the expected benefits (i.e., added sales) only with the cost of the adver-tising. But additional sales mean increased production costs that must also be taken into account.
21
A Rule of Thumb for Advertising
Like the rule MR =MC, equation (11.3) is sometimes difficult to apply in 
practice. In Chapter 10, we saw that MR /H11005 MC implies the following rule of 
thumb for pricing: ( P − MC)/P /H11005 −1/ED, where ED is the firm’s price elasticity of 
demand. We can combine this rule of thumb for pricing with equation (11.3) to obtain a rule of thumb for advertising.
First, rewrite equation (11.3) as follows:
(P-MC) /H9004Q
/H9004A =1
Now multiply both sides of this equation by A/PQ, the advertising-to-sales 
ratio:
P-MC
P c A
Q /H9004Q
/H9004A d= A
PQ
The term in brackets, ( A/Q)(/H9004Q//H9004A), is the advertising elasticity of demand,  
the percentage change in the quantity demanded that results from a 1-percent increase in advertising expenditures. We will denote this elasticity by E
A. Because 
(P − MC)/ P must equal −1/ EP, we can rewrite this equation as follows:
 A/PQ=-(EA/EP) (11.4)
Equation (11.4) is a rule of thumb for advertising. It says that to maximize 
profit, the firm’s advertising-to-sales ratio should be equal to minus the ratio of In equation (10.1), we offer 
a rule of thumb for pric-ing for a profit-maximizing firm—the markup over mar-ginal cost as a percentage of price should equal minus the inverse of the price elasticity of demand.

21To derive this result using calculus, differentiate p(Q,A) with respect to A, and set the derivative 
equal to zero:
0p/0A=P(0Q/0A)-MC( 0Q/0A)-1=0
Rearranging gives equation (11.3).432  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
the advertising and price elasticities of demand. Given information (from, say, 
market research studies) on these two elasticities, the firm can use this rule to check that its advertising budget is not too small or too large.
To put this rule into perspective, assume that a firm is generating sales rev-
enue of $1 million per year while allocating only $10,000 (1 percent of its rev-enues) to advertising. The firm knows that its advertising elasticity of demand is .2, so that a doubling of its advertising budget from $10,000 to $20,000 should increase sales by 20 percent. The firm also knows that the price elasticity of demand for its product is −4. Should it increase its advertising budget, know-ing that with a price elasticity of demand of −4, its markup of price over mar-ginal cost is substantial? The answer is yes; equation (11.4) tells us that the firm’s advertising-to-sales ratio should be −(.2/−4) =5 percent, so the firm should 
increase its advertising budget from $10,000 to $50,000.
This rule makes intuitive sense. It says firms should advertise a lot if (i) 
demand is very sensitive to advertising ( E
A is large), or if (ii) demand is not very 
price elastic ( EP is small). Although (i) is obvious, why should firms advertise 
more when the price elasticity of demand is small? A small elasticity of demand implies a large markup of price over marginal cost. Therefore, the marginal profit from each extra unit sold is high. In this case, if advertising can help sell a few more units, it will be worth its cost.
22
22Advertising often affects the price elasticity of demand, and this fact must be taken into account. 
For some products, advertising broadens the market by attracting a large range of customers, or by creating a bandwagon effect. This is likely to make demand more price elastic than it would have been otherwise. (But E
A is likely to be large, so that advertising will still be worthwhile.) Sometimes 
advertising is used to differentiate a product from others (by creating an image, allure, or brand identification), making the product’s demand less price elastic than it would otherwise be.EXAMPLE 11.6   ADVERTISING IN PRACTICE
In Example 10.2 (page 370), we 
looked at the use of markup pric-ing by supermarkets, convenience stores, and makers of designer jeans. We saw in each case how the markup of price over marginal cost depended on the firm’s price elasticity of demand. Now let’s see why these firms, as well as produc-ers of other goods, advertise as much (or as little) as they do.
First, supermarkets. We said that the price 
elasticity of demand for a typical supermarket is around −10. To determine the advertising-to-sales ratio, we also need to know the advertising elas-ticity of demand. This number can vary consider-ably depending on what part of the country the supermarket is located in and whether it is in a city, suburb, or rural area. A reasonable range, however, would be 0.1 to 0.3. 
Substituting these numbers into equation (11.4), we find that the manager of a typical supermar-ket should have an advertising budget of around 1 to 3 percent of sales—which is indeed what many supermarkets spend on advertising.
Convenience stores have lower price elas-
ticities of demand (around −5), but their advertising-to-sales ratios are usually less than those for supermarkets (and are often zero). Why? Because convenience stores mostly serve customers who live nearby; they may need a few items late at night or may simply not want to drive to the supermarket. These customers already know about the convenience store and are unlikely to change their buying habits if the store 
CHAPTER 11   •  Pricing with Market Power  433
advertises. Thus EA is very small, and advertising 
is not worthwhile.
Advertising is quite important for makers of 
designer jeans, who will have advertising-to-sales ratios as high as 10 or 20 percent. Advertising helps to make consumers aware of the label and gives it an aura and image. We said that price elasticities of demand in the range of −3 to −4 are typical for the major labels, and advertising elasticities of demand can range from .3 to as high as 1. So, these levels of advertising would seem to make sense.
Laundry detergents have among the high-
est advertising-to-sales ratios of all products, sometimes exceeding 30 percent, even though demand for any one brand is at least as price  elastic as it is for designer jeans. What justifies all 
the  advertising? A very large advertising elasticity. 
The demand for any one brand of laundry deter-gent depends crucially on advertising; without it, consumers would have little basis for selecting that particular brand.
23
Finally, Table 11.7 shows sales, advertising expen-
ditures, and the ratio of the two for leading brands of over-the-counter drugs. Observe that overall, the ratios are quite high. As with laundry detergents, the advertising elasticity for name-brand drugs is very high. Alka-Seltzer, Mylanta, and Tums, for instance, are all antacids that do much the same thing. Sales depend on consumer identification with a particular brand, which requires advertising.

SUMMARY
 1. Firms with market power are in an enviable position 
because they have the potential to earn large profits. Realizing that potential, however, may depend criti-cally on pricing strategy. Even if the firm sets a single price, it needs an estimate of the elasticity of demand for its output. More complicated strategies, which can involve setting several different prices, require even more information about demand.
 2. A pricing strategy aims to enlarge the customer base that 
the firm can sell to and capture as much consumer sur-plus as possible. There are a number of ways to do this, and they usually involve setting more than a single price.
 3. Ideally, the firm would like to price discriminate 
 perfectly—i.e., to charge each customer his or her res-ervation price. In practice, this is almost always impos-sible. On the other hand, various forms of imperfect price discrimination are often used to increase profits.
 4. The two-part tariff is another means of capturing con-
sumer surplus. Customers must pay an “entry” fee that allows them to buy the good at a per-unit price. 
The two-part tariff is most effective when customer demands are relatively homogeneous.
 5. When demands are heterogeneous and negatively 
correlated, bundling can increase profits. With pure bundling, two or more different goods are sold only as a package. With mixed bundling, the customer can buy the goods individually or as a package. Mixed bundling can be more profitable than pure bundling if marginal costs are significant or if demands are not 
perfectly negatively correlated.
 6. Bundling is a special case of tying, a requirement that 
products be bought or sold in some combination. Tying can be used to meter demand or to protect cus-tomer goodwill associated with a brand name.
 7. Advertising can further increase profits. The 
 profit-maximizing advertising-to-sales ratio is equal in magnitude to the ratio of the advertising and price elasticities of demand.
QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW
 1. Suppose a firm can practice perfect, first-degree price 
discrimination. What is the lowest price it will charge, and what will its total output be?
 2. How does a car salesperson practice price discrimina-
tion? How does the ability to discriminate correctly affect his or her earnings?
 3. Electric utilities often practice second-degree price dis-
crimination. Why might this improve consumer wel-fare?
 4. Give some examples of third-degree price discrimina-
tion. Can third-degree price discrimination be effective if the different groups of consumers have different lev-els of demand but the same price elasticities?
 5. Show why optimal, third-degree price discrimina-
tion requires that marginal revenue for each group of consumers equals marginal cost. Use this condition to explain how a firm should change its prices and total output if the demand curve for one group of consum-ers shifts outward, causing marginal revenue for that group to increase.
 6. When pricing automobiles, American car companies 
typically charge a much higher percentage markup over cost for “luxury option” items (such as leather trim, etc.) than for the car itself or for more “basic” options such as power steering and automatic  transmission. Explain why.
 7. How is peak-load pricing a form of price discrimi-
nation? Can it make consumers better off? Give an  example. 8. How can a firm determine an optimal two-part tariff 
if it has two customers with different demand curves? (Assume that it knows the demand curves.)
 9. Why is the pricing of a Gillette safety razor a form of 
two-part tariff? Must Gillette be a monopoly producer of its blades as well as its razors? Suppose you were advising Gillette on how to determine the two parts of the tariff. What procedure would you suggest?
 10. In the town of Woodland, California, there are many 
dentists but only one eye doctor. Are senior citizens more likely to be offered discount prices for dental exams or for eye exams? Why?
 11. Why did MGM bundle Gone with the Wind  and Getting 
Gertie’s Garter ? What characteristic of demands is 
needed for bundling to increase profits?
 12. How does mixed bundling differ from pure bundling? 
Under what conditions is mixed bundling preferable to pure bundling? Why do many restaurants practice mixed bundling (by offering a complete dinner as well as an à la carte menu) instead of pure bundling?

 1. Price discrimination requires the ability to sort cus-
tomers and the ability to prevent arbitrage. Explain how the following can function as price discrimination schemes and discuss both sorting and arbitrage:
 a. Requiring airline travelers to spend at least one 
Saturday night away from home to qualify for a low fare.

 d. Offering temporary price cuts on bathroom tissue.
 e. Charging high-income patients more than low-
income patients for plastic surgery.
 2. If the demand for drive-in movies is more elastic for 
couples than for single individuals, it will be optimal for theaters to charge one admission fee for the driver of the car and an extra fee for passengers. True or false? Explain.
 3. In Example 11.1 (page 408), we saw how producers of 
processed foods and related consumer goods use cou-pons as a means of price discrimination. Although cou-pons are widely used in the United States, that is not the case in other countries. In Germany, coupons are illegal.

make German consumers  better off or worse off?
 b. Does prohibiting the use of coupons make German 
producers  better off or worse off?
 4. Suppose that BMW can produce any quantity of cars 
at a constant marginal cost equal to $20,000 and a fixed cost of $10 billion. You are asked to advise the CEO as to what prices and quantities BMW should set for sales in Europe and in the United States. The demand for BMWs in each market is given by
Q
E=4,000,000 -100PE
and
QU=1,000,000 -20PU
where the subscript E denotes Europe, the subscript 
U denotes the United States. Assume that BMW can 
restrict U.S. sales to authorized BMW dealers only.
 a. What quantity of BMWs should the firm sell in each 
market, and what should the price be in each mar-ket? What should the total profit be?
 b. If BMW were forced to charge the same price in 
each market, what would be the quantity sold in each market, the equilibrium price, and the com-pany’s profit?

between two geographically separated markets (East Coast and Midwest). Demand and marginal revenue 
for the two markets are
P
1=15-Q1       MR 1=15-2Q1
P2=25-2Q2   MR 2=25-4Q2
The monopolist’s total cost is C /H11005 5 /H11001 3(Q1 /H11001 Q2). 
What are price, output, profits, marginal revenues, and deadweight loss (i) if the monopolist can price dis-criminate? (ii) if the law prohibits charging different prices in the two regions?
 *6. Elizabeth Airlines (EA) flies only one route: Chicago– 
Honolulu. The demand for each flight is Q /H11005 500 − P. 
EA’s cost of running each flight is $30,000 plus $100 per passenger.
 a. What is the profit-maximizing price that EA will 
charge? How many people will be on each flight? What is EA’s profit for each flight?
 b. EA learns that the fixed costs per flight are in fact 
$41,000 instead of $30,000. Will the airline stay in business for long? Illustrate your answer using a graph of the demand curve that EA faces, EA’s aver-age cost curve when fixed costs are $30,000, and EA’s average cost curve when fixed costs are $41,000.
 c. Wait! EA finds out that two different types of people 
fly to Honolulu. Type A consists of business people 
with a demand of Q
A /H11005 260 − 0.4 P. Type B consists 
of students whose total demand is QB /H11005 240 − 0.6 P. 
Because the students are easy to spot, EA decides to charge them different prices. Graph each of these demand curves and their horizontal sum. What price does EA charge the students? What price does it charge other customers? How many of each type are on each flight?
 d. What would EA’s profit be for each flight? Would 
the airline stay in business? Calculate the consumer surplus of each consumer group. What is the total consumer surplus?
 e. Before EA started price discriminating, how much 
consumer surplus was the Type A demand getting 
from air travel to Honolulu? Type B? Why did total 
consumer surplus decline with price discrimina-tion, even though total quantity sold remained unchanged?
 7. Many retail video stores offer two alternative plans for 
renting films:
• A two-part tariff:  Pay an annual membership fee 
(e.g., $40) and then pay a small fee for the daily rental of each film (e.g., $2 per film per day).
• A straight rental fee:  Pay no membership fee, but 
pay a higher daily rental fee (e.g., $4 per film per day).436  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
What is the logic behind the two-part tariff in this 
case? Why offer the customer a choice of two plans rather than simply a two-part tariff?

Los Angeles and New York. The demand functions for each of these two groups are
Q
NY=60-0.25PNY

 a. What are the profit-maximizing prices and quanti-
ties for the New York and Los Angeles markets?
 b. As a consequence of a new satellite that the 
Pentagon recently deployed, people in Los Angeles receive Sal’s New York broadcasts and people in New York receive Sal’s Los Angeles broadcasts. As a result, anyone in New York or Los Angeles can receive Sal’s broadcasts by subscribing in either city. Thus Sal can charge only a single price. What price should he charge, and what quantities will he sell in New York and Los Angeles?
 c. In which of the above situations, (a) or (b), is Sal 
better off? In terms of consumer surplus, which sit-uation do people in New York prefer and which do people in Los Angeles prefer? Why?
 *9. You are an executive for Super Computer, Inc. (SC), 
which rents out super computers. SC receives a fixed rental payment per time period in exchange for the right to unlimited computing at a rate of P cents per sec-
ond. SC has two types of potential customers of equal number—10 businesses and 10 academic institutions. Each business customer has the demand function  
Q /H11005 10 − P, where Q is in millions of seconds per 
month; each academic institution has the demand  Q /H11005 8 − P. The marginal cost to SC of additional com-
puting is 2 cents per second, regardless of volume.
 a. Suppose that you could separate business and aca-
demic customers. What rental fee and usage fee would you charge each group? What would be your profits?
 b. Suppose you were unable to keep the two types 
of customers separate and charged a zero rental fee. What usage fee would maximize your profits? What would be your profits?
 c. Suppose you set up one two-part tariff—that is, 
you set one rental and one usage fee that both busi-ness and academic customers pay. What usage and rental fees would you set? What would be your profits? Explain why price would not be equal to 
marginal cost.
 10. As the owner of the only tennis club in an isolated 
wealthy community, you must decide on membership dues and fees for court time. There are two types of tennis players. “Serious” players have demand
Q
1=10-P
where Q1 is court hours per week and P is the fee per 
hour for each individual player. There are also “occa-sional” players with demand
Q2=4-0.25P
Assume that there are 1000 players of each type. Because you have plenty of courts, the marginal cost of court time is zero. You have fixed costs of $10,000 per week. Serious and occasional players look alike, so you must charge them the same prices.
 a. Suppose that to maintain a “professional” atmos-
phere, you want to limit membership to serious players. How should you set the annual  member-
ship dues and court fees (assume 52 weeks per year) to maximize profits, keeping in mind the constraint that only serious players choose to join? What would profits be (per week)?
 b. A friend tells you that you could make greater prof-
its by encouraging both types of players to join. Is your friend right? What annual dues and court fees would maximize weekly profits? What would these profits be?
 c. Suppose that over the years, young, upwardly 
mobile professionals move to your community, all of whom are serious players. You believe there are now 3000 serious players and 1000 occasional  players. Would it still be profitable to cater to the occasional player? What would be the profit- maximizing annual dues and court fees? What would profits be per week?
 11. Look again at Figure 11.12 (p. 420), which shows the 
reservation prices of three consumers for two goods. Assuming that marginal production cost is zero for both goods, can the producer make the most money by selling the goods separately, by using pure bundling, or by using mixed bundling? What prices should be charged?
 12. Look again at Figure 11.17 (p. 424). Suppose that 
the marginal costs c

this case, pure bundling, not mixed bundling, is the most profitable pricing strategy. What price should be charged for the bundle? What will the firm’s profit be?
 13. Some years ago, an article appeared in the New York 
Times  about IBM’s pricing policy. The previous day, CHAPTER 11   •  Pricing with Market Power  437
IBM had announced major price cuts on most of its 
small and medium-sized computers. The article said:
IBM probably has no choice but to cut prices peri-
odically to get its customers to purchase more and lease less. If they succeed, this could make life more difficult for IBM’s major competitors. Outright  purchases of  computers are needed for ever larger IBM revenues and profits, says Morgan Stanley’s Ulric Weil in his new book, Information Systems in 
the 80’s.  Mr. Weil declares that IBM cannot revert to 
an emphasis on leasing.
 a. Provide a brief but clear argument in support  of the 
claim that IBM should try “to get its customers to purchase more and lease less.”
 b. Provide a brief but clear argument against  this 
claim.
 c. What factors determine whether leasing or selling is 
preferable for a company like IBM? Explain briefly.
 14. You are selling two goods, 1 and 2, to a market con-
sisting of three consumers with reservation prices as  follows:
RESERVATION PRICE ($)
CONSUMER FOR 1 FOR 2
A 20 100
B 60 60
C 100 20
The unit cost of each product is $30.
 a. Compute the optimal prices and profits for (i) sell-
ing the goods separately, (ii) pure bundling, and (iii) mixed bundling.
 b. Which strategy would be most profitable? Why?
 15. Your firm produces two products, the demands for 
which are independent. Both products are produced at zero marginal cost. You face four consumers (or groups of consumers) with the following reservation prices:
CONSUMER GOOD 1($) GOOD 2($)
A 25 100
B 40 80
C 80 40
D 100 25
 a. Consider three alternative pricing strategies: 
(i) selling the goods separately; (ii) pure bundling; (iii) mixed bundling. For each strategy , determine 
the optimal prices to be charged and the resulting profits. Which strategy would be best? b. Now suppose that the production of each good 
entails a marginal cost of $30. How does this  information change your answers to (a)? Why is the optimal strategy now different?
 16. A cable TV company offers, in addition to its basic 
service, two products: a Sports Channel (Product 1) and a Movie Channel (Product 2). Subscribers to the basic service can subscribe to these additional serv-ices individually at the monthly prices P
1 and P2, 
 respectively, or they can buy the two as a bundle for the price P
B, where PB < P1 /H11001 P2. They can also forgo 
the additional services and simply buy the basic serv-ice. The company’s marginal cost for these additional services is zero.  Through market research, the cable 
company has estimated the reservation prices for these two services for a representative group of consumers in the company’s service area. These reservation prices are plotted (as x’s) in Figure 11.21, as are the prices P
1, 
P2, and PB that the cable company is currently charg-
ing. The graph is divided into regions I, II, III, and IV .
 a. Which products, if any, will be purchased by the 
consumers in region I? In region II? In region III? In region IV? Explain briefly.
 b. Note that as drawn in the figure, the reservation 
prices for the Sports Channel and the Movie Channel are negatively correlated. Why would you, or why would you not, expect consumers’ reservation prices for cable TV channels to be negatively correlated?

the marginal cost of providing an additional chan-nel is zero, mixed bundling offers no advantage over pure bundling. Our profits would be just

Appendix to Chapter 11
The Vertically Integrated Firm
Many firms are integrated —they consist of several divisions, each with its own 
managers. Some firms are horizontally integrated:  There are several divisions 
that produce the same or closely related products. We saw an example of this when we discussed the multi-plant firm in Section 10.1. Some firms are verti-
cally integrated:  They have several divisions, with some divisions producing 
parts and components which other divisions use to produce the finished prod-uct. For example, automobile companies have “upstream” divisions that pro-duce engines, brakes, radiators and other components that the “downstream” divisions use to produce the finished cars. (Some firms are both vertically and horizontally integrated.)
This appendix explains the economic issues that arise in a vertically inte-
grated firm. As we will see, vertical integration has important benefits, but it also introduces complex pricing decisions: How should the firm value the parts and components that are transferred from the upstream to the downstream divi-sions? The firm must determine transfer prices,  the internal prices at which the 
parts and components from upstream divisions are “sold” to downstream divi-sions. Transfer prices must be chosen correctly because they are the signals that divisional managers use to determine output levels.
We will begin by explaining the advantages of vertical integration—advan-
tages to the firm, as well as to the consumers who buy the end products of the firm. Some firms, however, are not vertically integrated; they simply buy parts and components from other independent firms. To understand why, we will explain some of the problems associated with vertical integration. Next, we will explain transfer pricing, and show how a vertically integrated firm should choose its transfer prices in a way that maximizes the firm’s total profit.
Why Vertically Integrate?
There are a number of advantages to vertical integration. If upstream and down-stream divisions are part of the same firm, it might be easier to guarantee that parts and components are produced and delivered on time, and are made to the precise specifications needed by the downstream division. (On the other hand, a carefully written and enforced contract between independent upstream and downstream firms can often achieve the same thing.) The biggest advantage of vertical integration, however, is that it avoids the problem of “double marginali-zation,” i.e., it avoids a double markup.
Market Power and Double Marginalization
Often, one or more firms selling to each other along a vertical chain will have mar-ket power. For example, United Technologies and General Electric have monop-oly power in the production of jet aircraft engines, which they sell to Boeing and Airbus, which in turn have monopoly power in the market for commercial aircraft. How do firms along a vertical chain exercise such monopoly power, and how are prices and output affected? Would the firms benefit from a vertical merger that integrates an upstream and a related downstream business? Would consumers?• horizontal integration  
Organizational form in which several plants produce the same or related products for a firm.
• vertical integration  
Organizational form in which a firm contains several divisions, with some producing parts and components that others use to produce finished products.
• transfer prices  Internal 
prices at which parts and components from upstream divisions are “sold” to downstream divisions within a firm.440  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
To answer these questions, consider the following example. Suppose an 
engine manufacturer has monopoly power in the market for engines, and an automobile manufacturer that buys these engines has monopoly power in the market for its cars. Would this market power cause these two firms to benefit in any way if they were to merge? Would consumers of the final product—auto-mobiles—be better or worse off if the two companies merged? Many people (who haven’t read this book) would answer “maybe” to the first question, and “worse off” to the second question. It turns out, however, that when there is market power of this sort, a vertical merger can be beneficial to the two firms, and also beneficial to consumers.
SEPARATE FIRMS To see this, consider the following simple example. Suppose 
a monopolist producer of specialty engines produces those engines at a constant marginal cost c
E, and sells the engines at a price PE. The engines are bought by a 
monopolist producer of sports cars, which sells the cars at the price P. Demand 
for the cars is given by
 Q=A-P (A11.1)
with the constant A > cE. To keep this example as simple as possible, we will 
assume that the automobile manufacturer has no additional costs other than the cost of the engine. (As an exercise, you can repeat this example assuming that there is an additional constant marginal cost c
A to assemble the cars.)
If the two companies are independent of each other, the automobile manu-
facturer will take the price of engines as given, and choose a price for its cars to maximize its profits:
 p
A=(P-PE)(A-P) (A11.2)
You can check that given PE, the profit maximizing price of cars is:1
 P*= 1
2 (A+PE) (A11.3)
Then the number of cars sold and the automobile company’s profit are:2
 Q= 1
2 (A-PE) (A11.4)
and
 pA= 1
4 (A-PE)2 (A11.5)
1Take the derivative of pA with respect to P and set it equal to zero.
2Substitute expression (A11.3) for P* into equations (A11.1) for Q and (A11.2) for pA.CHAPTER 11   •  Pricing with Market Power  441
What about the engine manufacturer? It chooses the price of engines, PE, to 
maximize its profit:
 pE=(PE-cE)Q(PE)
  =(PE-cE) 1
2 (A-PE) (A11.6)
You can confirm that the profit-maximizing price of engines is:3
 PE*= 1
2 (A+cE) (A11.7)
The profit to the engine manufacturer is then equal to:
 pE*=1
8 (A-cE)2 (A11.8)
Now go back to Equation (A11.5) for the profit to the automobile manufacturer, 
and substitute in Equation (A11.7) for the price of engines. You will see that the automobile company’s profit is then:
 p
A*=1
16 (A-cE)2 (A11.9)
Hence the total profit for the two companies is:
 pTOT*=pA*+pE*=3
16 (A-cE)2 (A11.10)
Also, the price of cars paid by consumers is:
 P*=1
4 (3A+cE) (A11.11)
VERTICAL INTEGRATION Now suppose that the engine company and the auto-
mobile company merge to form a vertically integrated firm. The management of this firm would choose a price of automobiles to maximize the firm’s profit:
 p=(P-c
E)(A-P) (A11.12)
The profit-maximizing price of cars is now:
 P*=(A+cE)/2 (A11.13)
which yields a profit of:
 p*=1
4 (A-cE)2 (A11.14)
3Now take the derivative of pE with respect to PE and set it equal to zero.442  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
Observe that the profit for the integrated firm is greater  than the total profit 
for the two individual firms that operate independently. Furthermore, the price to consumers for automobiles is lower.  (To confirm that this is indeed the case, 
compare (A11.11) with (A11.13) and remember that A > c
E.) Hence, in this case 
vertical integration benefits not only the merging firms, but also consumers.
DOUBLE MARGINALIZATION Why would a vertical merger make both the 
merging firms and consumers better off? The reason is that vertical integration avoids the problem of double marginalization.  When the two firms operate 
independently, each one exercises its monopoly power by marking up its price above its marginal cost. But to do this, each firm must contract its output. The engine producer contracts its output to mark up its price above its marginal cost, and then the automobile manufacturer does likewise. This “double marginaliza-tion” pushes the price above the “single marginalization” or single markup over price of the integrated firm.
This example of double marginalization is illustrated graphically in  
Figure A11.1, which shows the demand curve (average revenue curve) for cars, and the corresponding marginal revenue curve. For the automobile company, the marginal revenue curve for cars is the demand curve for engines (effec-tively, the net marginal revenue for engines). It describes the number of engines that the auto maker will buy as a function of price. From the point of view of the engine company, it is the average revenue curve for engines (i.e., the demand curve for engines that the engine company faces). Corresponding to that demand curve is the engine company’s marginal revenue curve for engines, labeled MR
E in the figure. If the engine company and automobile company are 
separate entities, the engine company will produce a quantity of engines at the point where its marginal revenue curve intersects its marginal cost curve. That • double marginalization

EXAMPLE OF DOUBLE MARGINALIZATION
For the automobile company, the marginal revenue 
curve for cars is the demand curve for engines (the net marginal revenue for engines). Corresponding to that demand curve is the engine company’s mar-ginal revenue curve, MR
E. If the engine company 
and automobile company are separate entities, the engine company will produce a quantity of engines Q
E at the point where its marginal revenue curve 
intersects its marginal cost curve. The automo-bile maker will buy those engines and produce an equal number of cars. Hence, the price of cars will be P’
A. But if the firms merge, the integrated com-
pany will have the demand curve ARCARS and mar-
ginal revenue curve MRCARS. It produces a number 
of engines and equal number of cars at the point where MR
CARS equals the marginal cost of produc-
ing cars, which is MCE. Thus more engines and cars 
are produced, and the price of cars is lower.CHAPTER 11   •  Pricing with Market Power  443
quantity of engines is labeled Q’E. The automobile maker will buy those engines 
and produce an equal number of cars. Hence, the price of cars will be P’A.
What happens if the two companies merge? The integrated company will 
have the demand curve ARCARS and the corresponding marginal revenue curve 
MRCARS. It will produce a number of engines and equal number of cars at the 
point where the marginal revenue curve for cars intersects the marginal cost of producing cars, which in this example is simply the marginal cost of engines. As shown in the figure, there will be a larger quantity of engines and cars produced at a correspondingly lower price.
ALTERNATIVES TO VERTICAL INTEGRATION What can firms do to reduce 
the problem of double marginalization if a vertical merger is not an option? One solution is for the upstream firm to try to make the downstream market as com-petitive as possible, thereby reducing any double marginalization. Thus, Intel, which has monopoly power in processors, would like to do everything it can to make sure that the market for personal computers remains highly competitive, and might even help computer firms that are in danger of going out of business.
A second method of dealing with double marginalization is called quantity 
forcing.  The idea is to impose a sales quota or other restriction on downstream 
firms so that they cannot reduce their output in an attempt to marginalize. For example, automobile companies will create financial incentives to push dealer-ships (which have some monopoly power) to sell as many cars as possible.
Transfer Pricing in the Integrated Firm
We now turn to the profit-maximizing vertically integrated firm and see how it should choose its transfer prices and divisional output levels. We begin with the simplest case: There is no outside market for the output of the upstream divi-sion; i.e., the upstream division produces a good that is neither produced nor used by any other firm. Later we will consider what happens when there is an outside market for the upstream division’s output.
Transfer Pricing When There Is No Outside Market
Look again at Figure A11.1. We saw that if the firm is integrated, the profit- maximizing number of engines and cars it will produce is Q
E /H11005 QA, at the point 
where MRCARS equals the marginal cost of producing cars, which is MCE. Now 
suppose the downstream automobile division had to “pay” the upstream engine division a transfer price for each engine it used. What should that transfer price be? It should equal the marginal cost of producing engines, i.e., MC
E. Why? 
Because then the automobile division will have a marginal cost of producing cars equal to MC
E, so that even if it is left to maximize its own divisional profit, 
it will produce the correct number of cars.
Another way to see this is in terms of opportunity cost.  What is the opportu-
nity cost to the integrated firm of utilizing one more engine (to produce one more car)? It is the marginal cost of engines. Thus we have a simple rule: Set the 
transfer price of any upstream parts and components equal to the marginal cost of pro-ducing those parts and components.
You might argue that the example illustrated in Figure A11.1 is oversimpli-
fied because the only cost of producing a car is the cost of an engine. So now consider a firm with three divisions: Two upstream divisions produce inputs to • quantity forcing  Use of a 
sales quota or other incentives to make downstream firms sell as much as possible.444  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
a downstream processing division. The two upstream divisions produce quanti-
ties Q1 and Q2 and have total costs C1(Q1) and C2(Q2). The downstream division 
produces a quantity Q using the production function
Q=f(K, L, Q1, Q2)
where K and L are capital and labor inputs, and Q1 and Q2 are the intermediate 
inputs from the upstream divisions. Excluding the costs of the inputs Q1 and Q2, 
the downstream division has a total production cost Cd(Q). Total revenue from 
sales of the final product is R(Q).
We assume there are no outside markets  for the intermediate inputs Q1and Q2; they 
can be used only by the downstream division. Then the firm has two problems:
 1. What quantities Q1, Q2, and Q will maximize its profit?
 2. Is there an incentive scheme that will decentralize the firm’s management? 
In particular, is there a set of transfer prices P1 and P2, so that if each divi-
sion maximizes its own divisional profit, the profit of the overall firm will also be maximized ?
To solve these problems, we note that the firm’s total profit is
 p(Q)=R(Q)-C
d(Q)-C1(Q1)-C2(Q2) (A11.15)
What is the level of Q1 that maximizes this profit? It is the level at which the cost 
of the last unit of Q1 is just equal to the additional revenue it brings to the firm.  The cost 
of producing one extra unit of Q1 is the marginal cost /H9004C1//H9004Q1 /H11005 MC1. How 
much extra revenue results from that one extra unit? An extra unit of Q1 allows 
the firm to produce more final output Q of an amount /H9004Q//H9004Q1 /H11005 MP1, the mar-
ginal product of Q1. An extra unit of final output results in additional revenue 
/H9004R//H9004Q /H11005 MR, but it also results in additional cost to the downstream divi-
sion of an amount /H9004Cd//H9004Q /H11005 MCd. Thus the net marginal revenue  NMR1 that the 
firm earns from an extra unit of Q1 is (MR − MCd)MP1. Setting this equal to the 
marginal cost of the unit, we obtain the following rule for profit maximization4:
 NMR 1=(MR -MC d)MP 1=MC 1 (A11.16)
Going through the same steps for the second intermediate input gives
 NMR 2=(MR -MC d)MP 2=MC 2 (A11.17)
Note from equations (A11.16) and (A11.17) that it is incorrect  to determine 
the firm’s final output level Q by setting marginal revenue equal to marginal 
cost for the downstream division—i.e., by setting MR /H11005 MCd. Doing so ignores 
the cost of producing the intermediate input. (MR exceeds MCd because this 
cost is positive.) Also, note that equations (A11.16) and (A11.17) are standard In §10.1, we explain that a 
firm maximizes its profit at the output at which marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost.
4Using calculus, we can obtain this rule by differentiating equation (A11.15) with respect to Q1:
 dp/dQ1=(dR/dQ)(0Q/0Q1)-(dCd/dQ)(0Q/0Q1)-dC1/dQ1
 =(MR -MC d)MP 1-MC 1
Setting d p/dQ /H11005 0 to maximize profit gives equation (A11.4).CHAPTER 11   •  Pricing with Market Power  445
 conditions of marginal analysis: The output of each upstream division should 
be such that its marginal cost is equal to its marginal contribution to the profit of the overall firm.
Now, what transfer prices P
1 and P2 should be “charged” to the downstream 
division for its use of the intermediate inputs? Remember that if each of the three divisions uses these transfer prices to maximize its own divisional profit, the profit of the overall firm should be maximized. The two upstream divisions will maximize their divisional profits, p
1 and p2, which are given by
p1=P1Q1-C1(Q1)
and
p2=P2Q2-C2(Q2)
Because the upstream divisions take P1 and P2 as given, they will choose Q1 and Q2 
so that P1 /H11005 MC1 and P2 /H11005 MC2. Similarly, the downstream division will maximize
p(Q)=R(Q)-Cd(Q)-P1Q1-P2Q2
Because the downstream division also takes P1 and P2 as given, it will choose Q1 
and Q2 so that
 (MR -MC d)MP 1=NMR 1=P1 (A11.18)
and
 (MR -MC d)MP 2=NMR 2=P2 (A11.19)
Note that by setting the transfer prices equal to the respective marginal costs 
(P1 /H11005 MC1 and P2 /H11005 MC2), the profit-maximizing conditions given by equations 
(A11.16) and (A11.17) will be satisfied. We therefore have a simple solution to the transfer pricing problem: Set each transfer price equal to the marginal cost of the 
respective upstream division.  Then when each division is required to maximize its 
own profit, the quantities Q
1 and Q2 that the upstream divisions will want to 
produce will be the same quantities that the downstream division will want to “buy,” and they will maximize the firm’s total profit.
To illustrate this graphically, suppose Race Car Motors, Inc., has two divi-
sions. The upstream Engine Division produces engines, and the downstream Assembly Division puts together automobiles, using one engine (and a few other parts) in each car. In Figure A11.2, the average revenue curve AR is Race Car Motors’ demand curve for cars. (Note that the firm has monopoly power in the automobile market.) MC
A is the marginal cost of assembling automobiles, 
given the engines  (i.e., it does not include the cost of the engines). Because the car 
requires one engine, the marginal product of the engines is one. Thus the curve labeled MR − MC
A is also the net marginal revenue curve for engines:
NMR E=(MR -MC A)MP E=MR -MC A
The profit-maximizing number of engines (and number of cars) is given by 
the intersection of the net marginal revenue curve NMRE with the marginal cost 
curve for engines MCE. Having determined the number of cars that it will pro-
duce, and knowing its divisional cost functions, the management of Race Car 446  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
Motors can now set the transfer price PE that correctly values the engines used to 
produce its cars. This is the transfer price that should be used to calculate divi-sional profit (and year-end bonuses for divisional managers).
Transfer Pricing with a Competitive Outside Market
Now suppose there is a competitive  outside market for the intermediate good pro-
duced by an upstream division. Because the outside market is competitive, there is a single market price at which one can buy or sell the good. Therefore, the marginal 
cost of the intermediate good is simply the market price.  Because the optimal transfer 
price must equal marginal cost, it must also equal the competitive market price.
To see this, suppose there is a competitive market for the engines that Race 
Car Motors produces. If the market price is low, Race Car Motors may want to buy some or all of its engines in the market; if it is high, it may want to sell engines in the market. Figure A11.3 illustrates the first case. For quantities below Q
E,1, the upstream division’s marginal cost of producing engines MCE is below 
the market price PE,M; for quantities above QE,1, it is above the market price. The 
firm should obtain engines at the least cost, so the marginal cost of engines MC E* 
will be the upstream division’s marginal cost for quantities up to QE,1 and the 
market price for quantities above QE,1. Note that Race Car Motors uses more 
engines and produces more cars than it would have had there been no outside engine market. The downstream division now buys Q
E,2 engines and produces 
an equal number of automobiles. However, it “buys” only QE,1 of these engines 
from the upstream division and the rest on the open market.
It might seem strange that Race Car Motors must go into the open market to 
buy engines that it can make itself. If it made all of its own engines, however, its marginal cost of producing them would exceed the competitive market price. Although the profit of the upstream division would be higher, the total profit of 
the firm would be lower.$/Q

The firm’s upstream division should produce a quan-

cause the firm uses one engine in every car, NMRE is 
the difference between the marginal revenue from selling cars and the marginal cost of assembling them, i.e., MR − MC

engines PE equals the marginal cost of producing

side market. Now the competitive market price PE,M is above the transfer price

The optimal transfer price for Race Car Motors

Race Car Motors’ marginal cost of engines 
MC E* is the upstream division’s marginal cost 
for quantities up to QE,1 and the market price

division should use a total of QE,2 engines to 
produce an equal number of cars; in that case, the marginal cost of engines equals net mar-ginal revenue. Q

are used by the downstream division to produce automobiles. The rest are sold 
in the outside market at the price PE,M.
Note that compared with a situation in which there is no outside engine mar-
ket, Race Car Motors is producing more engines but fewer cars. Why not pro-duce this larger number of engines but use all of them to produce more cars? Because the engines are too valuable. On the margin, the net revenue that can be earned from selling them in the outside market is higher than the net revenue from using them to build additional cars.
Transfer Pricing with a Noncompetitive  
Outside Market
Now suppose there is an outside market for the output of the upstream divi-
sion, but that market is not competitive. Suppose that the engines produced by the upstream Engine Division is a special one that only Race Car Motors can make, so that Race Car Motors can be a monopoly supplier  to that outside market 
while also producing engines for its own use. We will not work through the details of this case, but you should be able to see that the transfer price paid to the Engine Division will be below  the price at which engines are bought in 
the outside market. Why “pay” the Engine Division a price that is lower than that paid in the outside market? The reason is that the opportunity cost of uti-lizing an engine internally is just the marginal cost of producing the engine, whereas the opportunity cost of selling it outside is higher, because it includes a  monopoly markup.
Sometimes a vertically integrated firm can buy components in an outside 
market in which it has monopsony  power. Suppose, for example, that Race Car 
Motors is the only company that uses the engines produced by its upstream Engine Division, but other companies also make that engine. Thus Race Car Motors can obtain its engines from its upstream Engine Division, or can pur-chase them as a monopsonist  in the outside market. You should be able to see that 
in this case, the transfer price paid to the Engine Division will be above  the price 
at which engines are bought in the outside market. Why “pay” the upstream division a price that is higher than that paid in the outside market? With mon-opsony power, purchasing one additional engine in the outside market incurs a marginal expenditure  that is greater than the actual price paid in that market. 
(The marginal expenditure is higher because purchasing an additional unit raises the average expenditure paid for all  units bought in the outside market.) 
The marginal expenditure is the opportunity cost of buying an engine outside, and therefore should equal the transfer price paid to the Engine Division, so the transfer price will be greater than the price paid outside.
Taxes and Transfer Pricing
So far we have ignored taxes in our discussion of transfer pricing. But in fact taxes can play an important role in determining transfer prices when the objective is to maximize the after-tax  profits of the integrated firm. This is especially the case when 
the upstream and downstream divisions of the firm operate in different countries.
To see this, suppose that the upstream Engine Division of Race Car Motors 
happens to be located in an Asian country with a low corporate profits tax rate, while the downstream Assembly Division is located in the United States, with a higher tax rate. Suppose that in the absence of taxes, the marginal cost and thus the optimal transfer price for an engine is $5000. How would this transfer price be affected by taxes?CHAPTER 11   •  Pricing with Market Power  449
In our example, the difference in tax rates will cause the opportunity cost of 
using an engine downstream to exceed $5000. Why? Because the downstream profit generated by the use of the engine will be taxed at a relatively high rate. Thus, taking taxes into account, the firm will want to set a higher transfer price, perhaps $7000. This will reduce the downstream profits in the United States (so that the firm will pay less in taxes) and increase the profits of the upstream divi-sion, which faces a lower tax rate.
A Numerical Example
Suppose Race Car Motors has the following demand for its automobiles:
P=20,000 -Q
Its marginal revenue is thus
MR=20,000 -2Q
The downstream division’s cost of assembling cars is
CA(Q)=8000 Q
so that the division’s marginal cost is MCA /H11005 8000. The upstream division’s cost 
of producing engines is
CE(QE)=2QE2
The division’s marginal cost is thus MCE(QE) /H11005 4QE.
First, suppose there is no outside market  for the engines. How many engines 
and cars should the firm produce? What should be the transfer price for engines? To solve this problem, we set the net marginal revenue for engines equal to the marginal cost of producing engines. Because each car has one engine, Q
E /H11005 Q. 
The net marginal revenue of engines is thus
NMR E=MR -MC A=12,000 -2QE
Now set NMRE equal to MCE:
12,000 -2QE=4QE
Thus 6 QE /H11005 12,000 and QE /H11005 2000. The firm should therefore produce 2000 engines 
and 2000 cars. The optimal transfer price is the marginal cost of these 2000 engines:
PE=4QE=$8000
Second, suppose that engines can be bought or sold for $6000 in an outside 
competitive market.  This is below the $8000 transfer price that is optimal when 
there is no outside market, so the firm should buy some engines outside. Its marginal cost of engines, and the optimal transfer price, is now $6000. Set this $6000 marginal cost equal to the net marginal revenue of engines:
6000=NMR
E=12,000 -2QEIn §10.5, we explain that 
when a buyer has monop-sony power, its marginal expenditure curve lies above its average expenditure curve because the decision to buy an extra unit of the good raises the price that must be paid on all units.450  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
Thus the total quantity of engines and cars is now 3000. The company now pro-
duces more cars (and sells them at a lower price) because its cost of engines is lower. Also, since the transfer price for the engines is now $6000, the upstream Engine Division supplies only 1500 engines (because MC
E(1500) /H11005 $6000). The 
remaining 1500 engines are bought in the outside market.

 1. Suppose Boeing faces the following demand curve for 
the monthly sales of its 787 aircraft:
Q=120 -0.5p
Where Q is airplanes sold per month and P is the price 
in millions of dollars. The airplane uses a set of engines made by General Electric, and Boeing pays GE a price P
E 
(in millions of dollars) for each set of engines. The mar-ginal cost to GE of producing a set of engines is 20 (mil-lion dollars). In addition to paying for engines, Boeing incurs a marginal cost of 100 (million dollars) per plane.
 a. What is Boeing’s profit-maximizing price of air-
planes, given a price P
E for the engines? What is 
the profit-maximizing price that GE will charge for each set of engines? Given that price of engines, what price will Boeing charge for its airplanes?
 b. Suppose Boeing were to acquire GE’s engine divi-
sion, so that now the engines and airplanes are made by a single company. Now what price will the company charge for its airplanes?
 2. Review the numerical example about Race Car Motors. 
Calculate the profit earned by the upstream division, the downstream division, and the firm as a whole in each of the three cases examined: (a) there is no out-side market for engines; (b) there is a competitive mar-ket for engines in which the market price is $6000; and (c) the firm is a monopoly supplier of engines to an outside market. In which case does Race Car Motors earn the most profit? In which case does the upstream division earn the most? The downstream division?
 3. Ajax Computer makes a computer for climate control 
in office buildings. The company uses a microproc-essor produced by its upstream division, along with other parts bought in outside competitive markets. The microprocessor is produced at a constant marginal cost of $500, and the marginal cost of assembling the  computer (including the cost of the other parts) by the downstream division is a constant $700. The firm has been selling the computer for $2000, and until now there has been no outside market for the microprocessor.
 a. Suppose an outside market for the microproces-
sor develops and that Ajax has monopoly power in that market, selling microprocessors for $1000 each. Assuming that demand for the microprocessor is 
unrelated to the demand for the Ajax computer, what transfer price should Ajax apply to the microproces-sor for its use by the downstream computer divi-sion? Should production of computers be increased, decreased, or left unchanged? Explain briefly.
 b. How would your answer to (a) change if the 
demands for the computer and the microprocessors were competitive; i.e., if some of the people who buy the microprocessors use them to make climate control systems of their own?

where QL is the quantity of leather (in square yards) 
produced. Excluding leather, the cost function for run-ning shoes is

much leather should the Form Division supply internally? How much should it supply to the out-side market? Will Reebok buy any leather in the outside market? Find the optimal transfer price.
 c. Now suppose the leather is unique and of extremely 
high quality. Therefore, the Form Division may act as a monopoly supplier to the outside market as well as a supplier to the downstream division. Suppose the outside demand for leather is given by P /H11005 32 − Q

the use of leather by the downstream division? At what price, if any, should leather be sold to the out-side market? What quantity, if any, will be sold to the outside market? 451
In the last two chapters, we saw how firms with monopoly power 
can choose prices and output levels to maximize profit. We also saw that monopoly power does not require a firm to be a pure monopo-
list. In many industries, even though several firms compete with each other, each firm has at least some monopoly power: It has control over price and can profitably charge a price that exceeds marginal cost.
In this chapter, we examine market structures other than pure 
monopoly that can give rise to monopoly power. We begin with what might seem like an oxymoron: monopolistic competition.  A monopo-
listically competitive market is similar to a perfectly competitive  market in two key respects: There are many firms, and entry by new firms is not restricted. But it differs from perfect competition in that the product is differentiated : Each firm sells a brand or version of the product that 
 differs in quality, appearance, or reputation, and each firm is the sole producer of its own brand. The amount of monopoly power wielded by a firm depends on its success in differentiating its product from those of other firms. Examples of monopolistically competitive industries abound: Toothpaste, laundry detergent, and packaged  coffee are a few.
The second form of market structure we will examine is oligopoly:  a 
market in which only a few firms compete with one another, and entry by new firms is impeded. The product that the firms produce might be differentiated, as with automobiles, or it might not be, as with steel. Monopoly power and profitability in oligopolistic industries depend in part on how the firms interact. For example, if the interaction is more cooperative than competitive, firms could charge prices well above marginal cost and earn large profits.
In some oligopolistic industries, firms do cooperate, but in others, 
they compete aggressively, even though this means lower profits. To see why, we need to consider how oligopolistic firms decide on output and prices. These decisions are complicated because each firm must operate strategically —when making a decision, it must weigh the prob-
able reactions of its competitors. To understand oligopolistic markets, we must therefore introduce some basic concepts of gaming and strat-egy. We develop these concepts more fully in Chapter 13.
The third form of market structure that we examine is a cartel.  In a 
cartelized market, some or all firms explicitly collude : They coordinate 
prices and output levels to maximize joint  profits. Cartels can arise in 
markets that would otherwise be competitive, as with the OPEC oil cartel, or oligopolistic, as with the international bauxite cartel.12.1

At first glance, a cartel may seem like a pure monopoly. After all, the firms in 
a cartel appear to operate as though they were parts of one big company. But a cartel differs from a monopoly in two important respects. First, because cartels rarely control the entire market, they must consider how their pricing decisions will affect noncartel production levels. Second, because the members of a cartel are not part of one big company, they may be tempted to “cheat” their partners 
by undercutting prices and grabbing bigger shares of the market. As a result, many cartels tend to be unstable and short-lived.
12.1  Monopolistic Competition
In many industries, the products are differentiated. For one reason or another, con-sumers view each firm’s brand as different from other brands. Crest toothpaste, for example, is perceived to be different from Colgate, Aim, and other toothpastes. The difference is partly flavor, partly consistency, and partly  reputation—the con-sumer’s image (correct or incorrect) of the relative decay-preventing efficacy of Crest. As a result, some consumers (but not all) will pay more for Crest.
Because Procter & Gamble is the sole producer of Crest, it has monopoly 
power. But its monopoly power is limited because consumers can easily sub-stitute other brands if the price of Crest rises. Although consumers who prefer Crest will pay more for it, most of them will not pay much more. The typical Crest user might pay 25 or 50 cents a tube more, but probably not one or two dollars more. For most consumers, toothpaste is toothpaste, and the differences among brands are small. Therefore, the demand curve for Crest toothpaste, though downward sloping, is fairly elastic. (A reasonable estimate of the elastic-ity of demand for Crest is −5.) Because of its limited monopoly power, Procter & Gamble will charge a price that is higher, but not much higher, than marginal cost. The situation is similar for Tide detergent or Scott paper towels.
The Makings of Monopolistic Competition
A monopolistically competitive market has two key characteristics:
 1. Firms compete by selling differentiated products that are highly substitut-
able for one another but not perfect substitutes. In other words, the cross-price elasticities of demand are large but not infinite.
 2. There is free entry and exit:  It is relatively easy for new firms to enter the 
market with their own brands and for existing firms to leave if their prod-ucts become unprofitable.
To see why free entry is an important requirement, let’s compare the mar-
kets for toothpaste and automobiles. The toothpaste market is monopolistically competitive, but the automobile market is better characterized as an oligopoly. It is relatively easy for other firms to introduce new brands of toothpaste, and this limits the profitability of producing Crest or Colgate. If the profits were large, other firms would spend the necessary money (for development, produc-tion, advertising, and promotion) to introduce new brands of their own, which would reduce the market shares and profitability of Crest and Colgate.
The automobile market is also characterized by product differentiation. However, 
the large-scale economies involved in production make entry by new firms difficult. Thus, until the mid-1970s, when Japanese producers became important  competitors, the three major U.S. automakers had the market largely to themselves.In §10.2, we explain that a 
seller of a product has some monopoly power if it can profitably charge a price greater than marginal cost.• monopolistic competition

• oligopoly  Market in which 
only a few firms compete with one another, and entry by new firms is impeded.
• cartel  Market in which some 
or all firms explicitly collude, coordinating prices and output levels to maximize joint profits.CHAPTER 12   •  Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly  453
There are many other examples of monopolistic competition besides toothpaste. 
Soap, shampoo, deodorants, shaving cream, cold remedies, and many other items found in a drugstore are sold in monopolistically competitive markets. The mar-kets for many sporting goods are likewise monopolistically competitive. So is most retail trade, because goods are sold in many different stores that compete with one another by differentiating their services according to location, availability and expertise of salespeople, credit terms, etc. Entry is relatively easy, so if profits are high in a neighborhood because there are only a few stores, new stores will enter.
Equilibrium in the Short Run and the Long Run
As with monopoly, in monopolistic competition firms face downward-sloping demand curves. Therefore, they have some monopoly power. But this does not mean that monopolistically competitive firms are likely to earn large profits. Monopolistic competition is also similar to perfect competition: Because there is free entry, the potential to earn profits will attract new firms with competing brands, driving economic profits down to zero.
To make this clear, let’s examine the equilibrium price and output level for a 
monopolistically competitive firm in the short and long run. Figure 12.1(a) shows the short-run equilibrium. Because the firm’s product differs from its competi-tors’, its demand curve D
SR is downward sloping. (This is the firm’s  demand 
curve, not the market demand curve, which is more steeply sloped.) The profit-maximizing quantity Q
SR is found at the intersection of the marginal revenue

A MONOPOLISTICALLY COMPETITIVE FIRM IN THE SHORT AND LONG RUN
Because the firm is the only producer of its brand, it faces a downward-sloping demand curve. Price 
exceeds marginal cost and the firm has monopoly power. In the short run, described in part (a), price 
also exceeds average cost, and the firm earns profits shown by the yellow-shaded rectangle. In the long run, these profits attract new firms with competing brands. The firm’s market share falls, and its demand curve shifts downward. In long-run equilibrium, described in part (b), price equals average 
cost, so the firm earns zero profit even though it has monopoly power.454  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
and marginal cost curves. Because the corresponding price PSR exceeds average 
cost, the firm earns a profit, as shown by the shaded rectangle in the figure.
In the long run, this profit will induce entry by other firms. As they intro-
duce competing brands, our firm will lose market share and sales; its demand curve will shift down, as in Figure 12.1(b). (In the long run, the average and marginal cost curves may also shift. We have assumed for simplicity that costs do not change.) The long-run demand curve D
LR will be just tangent to the firm’s 
 average cost curve. Here, profit maximization implies the quantity QLR and the 
price PLR. It also implies zero profit  because price is equal to average cost. Our 
firm still has monopoly power: Its long-run demand curve is downward slop-ing because its particular brand is still unique. But the entry and competition of other firms have driven its profit to zero.
More generally, firms may have different costs, and some brands will be more 
distinctive than others. In this case, firms may charge slightly different prices, and some will earn small profits.
Monopolistic Competition and Economic Efficiency
Perfectly competitive markets are desirable because they are economically effi-cient: As long as there are no externalities and nothing impedes the workings of the market, the total surplus of consumers and producers is as large as possible. Monopolistic competition is similar to competition in some respects, but is it an efficient market structure? To answer this question, let’s compare the long-run equilibrium of a monopolistically competitive industry to the long-run equilib-rium of a perfectly competitive industry.
Figure 12.2 shows that there are two sources of inefficiency in a monopolisti-
cally competitive industry:
 1. Unlike perfect competition, with monopolistic competition the equilibri-
um price exceeds marginal cost. This means that the value to consumers of additional units of output exceeds the cost of producing those units. If output were expanded to the point where the demand curve intersects the marginal cost curve, total surplus could be increased by an amount equal to the yellow-shaded area in Figure 12.2(b). This should not be surprising. We saw in Chapter 10 that monopoly power creates a deadweight loss, and monopoly power exists in monopolistically competitive markets.
 2. Note in Figure 12.2(b) that for the monopolistically competitive firm, out-
put is below that which minimizes average cost. Entry of new firms drives profits to zero in both perfectly competitive and monopolistically competi-tive markets. In a perfectly competitive market, each firm faces a horizon-tal demand curve, so the zero-profit point occurs at minimum average cost, as Figure 12.2(a) shows. In a monopolistically competitive market, how-ever, the demand curve is downward sloping, so the zero-profit point is to the left of minimum average cost. Excess capacity is inefficient because average cost would be lower with fewer firms.
These inefficiencies make consumers worse off. Is monopolistic competi-
tion then a socially undesirable market structure that should be regulated? The answer—for two reasons—is probably no:
 1. In most monopolistically competitive markets, monopoly power is small. 
Usually enough firms compete, with brands that are sufficiently substitutable, so that no single firm has much monopoly power. Any resulting deadweight In §10.1, we explain that a 
monopolist maximizes profit by choosing an output at 
which marginal revenue is 
equal to marginal cost.
Recall from §8.7 that with the possibility of entry and exit, firms will earn zero 
economic profit in long-run 
equilibrium.
In §9.2, we explain that com-petitive markets are efficient because they maximize the sum of consumers’ and pro-ducers’ surplus.
In §10.4, we discuss the deadweight loss from monopoly power.CHAPTER 12   •  Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly  455
loss will therefore be small. And because firms’ demand curves will be fairly 
elastic, average cost will be close to the minimum.
2.Any inefficiency must be balanced against an important benefit from 
monopolistic competition: product diversity.  Most consumers value the 
ability to choose among a wide variety of competing products and brands that differ in various ways. The gains from product diversity can be large and may easily outweigh the inefficiency costs resulting from downward-sloping demand curves.MC AC

COMPARISON OF MONOPOLISTICALLY COMPETITIVE EQUILIBRIUM AND PERFECTLY 
COMPETITIVE EQUILIBRIUM
Under perfect competition, as in (a), price equals marginal cost, but under monopolistic competition, 
price exceeds marginal cost. Thus there is a deadweight loss, as shown by the yellow-shaded area in (b). In both types of markets, entry occurs until profits are driven to zero. Under perfect competition, the 
demand curve facing the firm is horizontal, so the zero-profit point occurs at the point of minimum aver-age cost. Under monopolistic competition the demand curve is downward-sloping, so the zero-profit point is to the left of the point of minimum average cost. In evaluating monopolistic competition, these inefficiencies must be balanced against the gains to consumers from product diversity.
EXAMPLE 12.1    MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION IN THE MARKETS FOR 
COLAS AND COFFEE
The markets for soft drinks and 
coffee illustrate the characteristics of monopolistic competition. Each market has a variety of brands that differ slightly but are close substi-tutes for one another. Each brand of cola, for example, tastes a little different from the next. (Can you tell the  difference between Coke 
and Pepsi? Between Coke and RC Cola?) And each brand of ground coffee has a slightly different fla-vor, fragrance, and caffeine con-tent. Most consumers develop their own preferences; you might prefer Maxwell House coffee to

12.2  Oligopoly
In oligopolistic markets, the products may or may not be differentiated. What 
matters is that only a few firms account for most or all of total production. In some oligopolistic markets, some or all firms earn substantial profits over the long run because barriers to entry  make it difficult or impossible for new 
firms to enter. Oligopoly is a prevalent form of market structure. Examples of

261–68; and Lakshman Krishnamurthi and S. P . Raj, “A Model of Brand Choice and Purchase Quantity Price Sensitivities,” Marketing Science  (1991). In typical simulated shopping experiments, 
consumers are asked to choose the brands that they prefer from a variety of prepriced brands. This trial is repeated several times, with different prices each time.other brands and buy it regularly. Brand loyalties, 
however, are  usually limited. If the price of Maxwell 
House were to rise substantially above those of other brands, you and most other consumers who had been buying it would probably switch brands.
Just how much monopoly power does General 
Foods, the producer of Maxwell House, have with this brand? In other words, how elastic is the demand for Maxwell House? Most large compa-
nies carefully study product demands as part of their market research. Company estimates are usu-ally proprietary, but two published studies of the demands for various brands of colas and ground coffees used simulated shopping experiments to determine how market shares for each brand would change in response to specific changes in price. Table 12.1 summarizes the results by showing the elasticities of demand for several brands.
1
First, note that among colas, RC Cola is much less 
price elastic than Coke. Although it has a small share of the cola market, its taste is more distinctive than that of Coke, Pepsi, and other brands, so consumers who buy it have stronger brand loyalty. But even though RC 
Cola has more monopoly power than Coke, it is not necessarily more profitable. Profits depend on fixed costs and volume, as well as price. Even if its aver-age profit is smaller, Coke will generate more profit because it has a much larger share of the market.
Second, note that coffees as a group are more price 
elastic than colas. There is less brand loyalty among coffee buyers than among cola buyers because the dif-ferences among coffees are less perceptible than the differences among colas. Note that the demand for Chock Full o’ Nuts is less price elastic than its competi-tors. Why? Because Chock Full o’ Nuts, like RC Cola, has a more distinctive taste than Folgers or Maxwell House, and so consumers who buy it tend to remain loyal. Fewer consumers notice or care about the taste differences between Folgers and Maxwell House.
With the exception of RC Cola and Chock Full o’ 
Nuts, all the colas and coffees are quite price elastic. With elasticities on the order of −4 to −8, each brand has only limited monopoly power. This is typical of monopolistic competition.

oligopolistic industries include automobiles, steel, aluminum, petrochemicals, 
electrical equipment, and computers.
Why might barriers to entry arise? We discussed some of the reasons in 
Chapter 10. Scale economies may make it unprofitable for more than a few firms to coexist in the market; patents or access to a technology may exclude potential competitors; and the need to spend money for name recognition and  market reputation may discourage entry by new firms. These are “natural” entry  barriers—they are basic to the structure of the particular market. In addi-tion, incumbent firms may take strategic actions  to deter entry. For example, they 
might threaten to flood the market and drive prices down if entry occurs, and to make the threat credible, they can construct excess production capacity.
Managing an oligopolistic firm is complicated because pricing, output, adver-
tising, and investment decisions involve important strategic considerations. Because only a few firms are competing, each firm must carefully consider how its actions will affect its rivals, and how its rivals are likely to react.
Suppose that because of sluggish car sales, Ford is considering a 10-percent 
price cut to stimulate demand. It must think carefully about how competing auto companies will react. They might not react at all, or they might cut their prices only slightly, in which case Ford could enjoy a substantial increase in sales, largely at the expense of its competitors. Or they might match Ford’s price cut, in which case all of the firms will sell more cars, but might make much lower profits because of the lower prices. Another possibility is that some firms will cut their prices by even more  than Ford to punish Ford for rocking the boat, 
and this in turn might lead to a price war and to a drastic fall in profits for the entire industry. Ford must carefully weigh all these possibilities. In fact, for almost any major economic decision that a firm makes—setting price, determin-ing production levels, undertaking a major promotion campaign, or investing in new production capacity—it must try to determine the most likely response of its competitors.
These strategic considerations can be complex. When making decisions, each 
firm must weigh its competitors’ reactions, knowing that these competitors will also weigh its reactions to their  decisions. Furthermore, decisions, reactions, 
reactions to reactions, and so forth are dynamic, evolving over time. When the managers of a firm evaluate the potential consequences of their decisions, they must assume that their competitors are as rational and intelligent as they are. Then, they must put themselves in their competitors’ place and consider how they would react.
Equilibrium in an Oligopolistic Market
When we study a market, we usually want to determine the price and quantity that will prevail in equilibrium. For example, we saw that in a perfectly com-petitive market, the equilibrium price equates the quantity supplied with the  quantity demanded. Then we saw that for a monopoly, an equilibrium occurs when marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Finally, when we studied monop-olistic competition, we saw how a long-run equilibrium results as the entry of new firms drives profits to zero.
In these markets, each firm could take price or market demand as given and 
largely ignore its competitors. In an oligopolistic market, however, a firm sets price or output based partly on strategic considerations regarding the behavior of its competitors. At the same time, competitors’ decisions depend on the first firm’s decision. How, then, can we figure out what the market price and  output will be in equilibrium—or whether there will even be an equilibrium? To answer 458  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
these questions, we need an underlying principle to describe an equilibrium 
when firms make decisions that explicitly take each other’s behavior into account.
Remember how we described an equilibrium in competitive and monopo-
listic markets: When a market is in equilibrium, firms are doing the best they can and 
have no reason to change their price or output.  Thus a competitive market is in equi-
librium when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded: Each firm is doing the best it can—it is selling all that it produces and is maximizing its profit. Likewise, a monopolist is in equilibrium when marginal revenue equals marginal cost because it, too, is doing the best it can and is maximizing its profit.
NASH EQUILIBRIUM  With some modification, we can apply this same princi-
ple to an oligopolistic market. Now, however, each firm will want to do the best it can given what its competitors are doing.  And what should the firm assume that 
its competitors are doing? Because the firm will do the best it can given what its competitors are doing, it is natural to assume that these competitors will do the best 
they can given what that firm is doing.  Each firm, then, takes its competitors into 
account, and assumes that its competitors are doing likewise.
This may seem a bit abstract at first, but it is logical, and as we will see, it 
gives us a basis for determining an equilibrium in an oligopolistic market. The concept was first explained clearly by the mathematician John Nash in 1951, so we call the equilibrium it describes a Nash equilibrium.  It is an important con-
cept that we will use repeatedly:
Nash Equilibrium:  Each firm is doing the best it can given what its competitors 
are doing.
We discuss this equilibrium concept in more detail in Chapter 13, where we 
show how it can be applied to a broad range of strategic problems. In this chap-ter, we will apply it to the analysis of oligopolistic markets.
To keep things as uncomplicated as possible, this chapter will focus largely 
on markets in which two firms are competing with each other. We call such a market a duopoly.  Thus each firm has just one competitor to take into account 
in making its decisions. Although we focus on duopolies, our basic results will also apply to markets with more than two firms.
The Cournot Model
We will begin with a simple model of duopoly first introduced by the French economist Augustin Cournot in 1838. Suppose the firms produce a homoge-neous good and know the market demand curve. Each firm must decide how much 
to produce, and the two firms make their decisions at the same time.  When making its 
production decision, each firm takes its competitor into account. It knows that its competitor is also deciding how much to produce, and the market price will 
depend on the total output  of both firms.
The essence of the Cournot model  is that each firm treats the output level of its 
competitor as fixed when deciding how much to produce.  To see how this works, let’s 
consider the output decision of Firm 1. Suppose Firm 1 thinks that Firm 2 will produce nothing. In that case, Firm 1’s demand curve is the market demand curve. In Figure 12.3 this is shown as D
1(0), which means the demand curve for 
Firm 1, assuming Firm 2 produces zero. Figure 12.3 also shows the correspond-ing marginal revenue curve MR
1(0). We have assumed that Firm 1’s marginal In §8.7, we explain that in a 
competitive market, long-run equilibrium occurs when no firm has an incentive to enter or exit because firms are earning zero economic profit and the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied.

cost MC1 is constant. As shown in the figure, Firm 1’s profit-maximizing output 
is 50 units, the point where MR1(0) intersects MC1. So if Firm 2 produces zero, 
Firm 1 should produce 50.
Suppose, instead, that Firm 1 thinks Firm 2 will produce 50 units. Then 
Firm 1’s demand curve is the market demand curve shifted to the left by 50. In Figure 12.3, this curve is labeled D
1(50), and the corresponding marginal reve-
nue curve is labeled MR1(50). Firm 1’s profit-maximizing output is now 25 units, 
the point where MR1(50) = MC1. Now, suppose Firm 1 thinks that Firm 2 will 
produce 75 units. Then Firm 1’s demand curve is the market demand curve shifted to the left by 75. It is labeled D
1(75) in Figure 12.3, and the corresponding 
marginal revenue curve is labeled MR1(75). Firm 1’s profit-maximizing output is 
now 12.5 units, the point where MR1(75) = MC1. Finally, suppose Firm 1 thinks 
that Firm 2 will produce 100 units. Then Firm 1’s demand and marginal revenue curves (which are not shown in the figure) would intersect its marginal cost curve on the vertical axis; if Firm 1 thinks that Firm 2 will produce 100 units or more, it should produce nothing.
REACTION CURVES  To summarize: If Firm 1 thinks that Firm 2 will produce 
nothing, it will produce 50; if it thinks Firm 2 will produce 50, it will produce 25; if it thinks Firm 2 will produce 75, it will produce 12.5; and if it thinks Firm 2 will produce 100, then it will produce nothing. Firm 1’s profit-maximizing output 
is thus a decreasing schedule of how much it thinks Firm 2 will produce.  We call this 
schedule Firm 1’s reaction curve  and denote it by Q*
1(Q2). This curve is plotted 
in Figure 12.4, where each of the four output combinations that we found above is shown as an x.• reaction curve  Relationship

FIRM 1’S OUTPUT DECISION
Firm 1’s profit-maximizing output depends on 
how much it thinks that Firm 2 will  produce. 
If it thinks Firm 2 will produce nothing, its  demand curve, labeled D
1(0), is the market 
demand curve. The corresponding marginal revenue curve, labeled MR
1(0), intersects Firm 
1’s marginal cost curve MC1 at an output of 50 
units. If Firm 1 thinks that Firm 2 will produce 50 units, its demand curve, D
1(50), is shifted 
to the left by this amount. Profit maximization now implies an output of 25 units. Finally, if Firm 1 thinks that Firm 2 will produce 75 units, Firm 1 will produce only 12.5 units.460  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
We can go through the same kind of analysis for Firm 2; that is, we can deter-
mine Firm 2’s profit-maximizing quantity given various assumptions about how much Firm 1 will produce. The result will be a reaction curve for Firm 2—i.e., a schedule Q
2*(Q1) that relates its output to the output that it thinks Firm 
1 will produce. If Firm 2’s marginal revenue or marginal cost curve is different from that of Firm 1, its reaction curve will also differ in form. For example, Firm 2’s reaction curve might look like the one drawn in Figure 12.4.
COURNOT EQUILIBRIUM  How much will each firm produce? Each firm’s 
reaction curve tells it how much to produce, given the output of its competitor. In equilibrium, each firm sets output according to its own reaction curve; the equilibrium output levels are therefore found at the intersection  of the two reac-
tion curves. We call the resulting set of output levels a Cournot equilibrium.  
In this equilibrium, each firm  correctly assumes how much its competitor will produce, and it maximizes its profit accordingly.
Note that this Cournot equilibrium is an example of a Nash equilibrium (and 
thus it is sometimes called a Cournot-Nash equilibrium ). Remember that in a Nash 
equilibrium, each firm is doing the best it can given what its competitors are doing. As a result, no firm would individually want to change its behavior. In the Cournot equilibrium, each firm is producing an amount that maximizes its profit given what its competitor is producing , so neither would want to change its output.
Suppose the two firms are initially producing output levels that differ from 
the Cournot equilibrium. Will they adjust their outputs until the Cournot equi-librium is reached? Unfortunately, the Cournot model says nothing about the dynamics of the adjustment process. In fact, during any adjustment process, the model’s central assumption that each firm can assume that its competitor’s output is fixed will not hold. Because both firms would be adjusting their out-puts, neither output would be fixed. We need different models to understand dynamic adjustment, and we will examine some in Chapter 13.
When is it rational for each firm to assume that its competitor’s output is 
fixed? It is rational if the two firms are choosing their outputs only once because • Cournot equilibrium

Firm 1’s reaction curve shows how much it will produce 
as a function of how much it thinks Firm 2 will produce. (The xs at Q
2 = 0, 50, and 75 correspond to the examples 
shown in Figure 12.3.) Firm 2’s reaction curve shows its output as a function of how much it thinks Firm 1 will produce. In Cournot equilibrium, each firm correctly  assumes the amount that its competitor will produce and 
thereby maximizes its own profits. Therefore, neither firm will move from this equilibrium.CHAPTER 12   •  Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly  461
then their outputs cannot change. It is also rational once they are in Cournot 
equilibrium because then neither firm will have any incentive to change its out-put. When using the Cournot model, we must therefore confine ourselves to the behavior of firms in equilibrium.
The Linear Demand Curve—An Example
Let’s work through an example—two identical firms facing a linear market demand curve. This will help clarify the meaning of a Cournot equilibrium and let us compare it with the competitive equilibrium and the equilibrium that results if the firms collude and choose their output levels cooperatively.
Suppose our duopolists face the following market demand curve:
P=30-Q
where Q is the total production of both firms (i.e., Q = Q
1 + Q2). Also, suppose 
that both firms have zero marginal cost:
MC 1=MC 2=0
We can determine the reaction curve for Firm 1 as follows. To maximize profit, 
it sets marginal revenue equal to marginal cost. Its total revenue R1 is given by
 R1=PQ 1=(30-Q)Q1
 =30Q1-(Q1+Q2)Q1
 =30Q1-Q12-Q2Q1
Its marginal revenue MR1 is just the incremental revenue /H9004R1 resulting from an 
incremental change in output /H9004Q1:
MR 1=/H9004R1//H9004Q1=30-2Q1-Q2
Now, setting MR1 equal to zero (the firm’s marginal cost) and solving for Q1, 
we find
 Firm  1=s reaction  curve : Q1=15- 1
2 Q2 (12.1)
The same calculation applies to Firm 2:
 Firm  2=s reaction  curve : Q2=15- 1
2 Q1 (12.2)
The equilibrium output levels are the values for Q1 and Q2 at the intersection 
of the two reaction curves—i.e., the levels that solve equations (12.1) and (12.2). By replacing Q
2 in equation (12.1) with the expression on the righthand side of 
(12.2), you can verify that the equilibrium output levels are
Cournot  equilibrium : Q1=Q2=10462  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
The total quantity produced is therefore Q = Q1 + Q2 = 20, so the equilibrium 
market price is P = 30 − Q = 10, and each firm earns a profit of 100.
Figure 12.5 shows the firms’ reaction curves and this Cournot equilibrium. 
Note that Firm 1’s reaction curve shows its output Q1 in terms of Firm 2’s output 
Q2. Likewise, Firm 2’s reaction curve shows Q2 in terms of Q1. (Because the firms 
are identical, the two reaction curves have the same form. They look different because one gives Q
1 in terms of Q2 and the other gives Q2 in terms of Q1.) The 
Cournot equilibrium is at the intersection of the two curves. At this point, each firm is maximizing its own profit, given its competitor’s output.
We have assumed that the two firms compete with each other. Suppose, 
instead, that the antitrust laws were relaxed and the two firms could collude. They would set their outputs to maximize total profit , and presumably they 
would split that profit evenly. Total profit is maximized by choosing total output Q so that marginal revenue equals marginal cost, which in this example is zero. 
Total revenue for the two firms is
R=PQ=(30-Q)Q=30Q-Q
2
Marginal revenue is therefore
MR=/H9004R//H9004Q=30-2Q
Setting MR equal to zero, we see that total profit is maximized when Q = 15.
Any combination of outputs Q1 and Q2 that add up to 15 maximizes total 
profit. The curve Q1 + Q2 = 15, called the collusion curve , therefore gives all pairs 
of outputs Q1 and Q2 that maximize total profit. This curve is also shown in 7.5101530

The demand curve is P = 30 − Q, and both firms 
have zero marginal cost. In Cournot  equilibrium, 
each firm produces 10. The collusion curve shows combinations of Q
1 and Q2 that maximize 
total  profits. If the firms collude and share prof-
its equally, each will produce 7.5. Also shown is the competitive equilibrium, in which price equals marginal cost and profit is zero.CHAPTER 12   •  Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly  463

the total output:
Q1=Q2=7.5
As you would expect, both firms now produce less—and earn higher prof-
its (112.50)—than in the Cournot equilibrium. Figure 12.5 shows this collusive equilibrium and the competitive  output levels found by setting price equal to 
marginal cost. (You can verify that they are Q
1 = Q2 = 15, which implies that each 
firm makes zero profit.) Note that the Cournot outcome is much better (for the firms) than perfect competition, but not as good as the outcome from collusion.
First Mover Advantage—The Stackelberg Model
We have assumed that our two duopolists make their output decisions at the same time. Now let’s see what happens if one of the firms can set its output first. There are two questions of interest. First, is it advantageous to go first? Second, how much will each firm produce?
Continuing with our example, we assume that both firms have zero marginal 
cost, and that market demand is given by P = 30 − Q, where Q is total output. 
Suppose Firm 1 sets its output first and then Firm 2, after observing Firm 1’s output, makes its output decision.  In setting output, Firm 1 must therefore consider how Firm 
2 will react.  This Stackelberg model  of duopoly is different from the Cournot 
model, in which neither firm has any opportunity to react.
Let’s begin with Firm 2. Because it makes its output decision after Firm 1, it 
takes Firm 1’s output as fixed. Therefore, Firm 2’s profit-maximizing  output is given by its Cournot reaction curve, which we derived above as equation (12.2):
 Firm  2
=s reaction  curve : Q2=15-1
2 Q1 (12.2)
What about Firm 1? To maximize profit, it chooses Q1 so that its marginal rev-
enue equals its marginal cost of zero. Recall that Firm 1’s revenue is
 R1=PQ 1=30Q1-Q12-Q2Q1 (12.3)
Because R1 depends on Q2, Firm 1 must anticipate how much Firm 2 will pro-
duce. Firm 1 knows, however, that Firm 2 will choose Q2 according to the reac-
tion curve (12.2). Substituting equation (12.2) for Q2 into equation (12.3), we find 
that Firm 1’s revenue is
 R1=30Q1-Q12-Q1a15-1
2 Q1b
 =15Q1-1
2 Q12
Its marginal revenue is therefore

Oligopoly model in which one firm sets its output before other firms do.464  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
Setting MR1 = 0 gives Q1 = 15. And from Firm 2’s reaction curve (12.2), we 
find that Q2 = 7.5. Firm 1 produces twice as much as Firm 2 and makes twice as 
much profit. Going first gives Firm 1 an advantage.  This may appear counterin-
tuitive: It seems disadvantageous to announce your output first. Why, then, is going first a strategic advantage?
The reason is that announcing first creates a fait accompli : No matter what 
your competitor does, your output will be large. To maximize profit, your com-petitor must take your large output level as given and set a low level of output for itself. If your competitor produced a large level of output, it would drive price down and you would both lose money. So unless your competitor views “getting even” as more important than making money, it would be irrational for it to produce a large amount. As we will see in Chapter 13, this kind of “first-mover advantage” occurs in many strategic situations.
The Cournot and Stackelberg models are alternative representations of 
 oligopolistic behavior. Which model is the more appropriate depends on the industry. For an industry composed of roughly similar firms, none of which has a strong operating advantage or leadership position, the Cournot model is prob-ably the more appropriate. On the other hand, some industries are dominated by a large firm that usually takes the lead in introducing new products or setting price; the mainframe computer market is an example, with IBM the leader. Then the Stackelberg model may be more realistic.
12.3  Price Competition
We have assumed that our oligopolistic firms compete by setting quantities. In many oligopolistic industries, however, competition occurs along price dimen-sions. For example, automobile companies view price as a key strategic variable, and each one chooses its price with its competitors in mind. In this section, we use the Nash equilibrium concept to study price competition, first in an industry that produces a homogeneous good and then in an industry with some degree of product differentiation.
Price Competition with Homogeneous  
Products—The Bertrand Model
The Bertrand model  was developed in 1883 by another French economist, 
Joseph Bertrand. Like the Cournot model, it applies to firms that produce the same homogeneous good and make their decisions at the same time. In this case, however, the firms choose prices  instead of quantities. As we will see, this 
change can dramatically affect the market outcome.
Let’s return to the duopoly example of the last section, in which the market 
demand curve is
P=30-Q
where Q = Q
1 + Q2 is again total production of a homogeneous good. This time, 
however, we will assume that both firms have a marginal cost of $3:
MC 1=MC 2=$3
As an exercise, you can show that the Cournot equilibrium for this duopoly, 
which results when both firms choose output  simultaneously, is Q1 = Q2 = 9. You • Bertrand model  Oligopoly 
model in which firms produce a homogeneous good, each firm treats the price of its competitors as fixed, and all firms decide simultaneously what price to charge.CHAPTER 12   •  Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly  465
can also check that in this Cournot equilibrium, the market price is $12, so that 
each firm makes a profit of $81.
Now suppose that these two duopolists compete by simultaneously choosing 
a price  instead of a quantity. What price will each firm choose, and how much 
profit will each earn? To answer these questions, note that because the good is homogeneous, consumers will purchase only from the lowest-price seller. Thus, if the two firms charge different prices, the lower-price firm will supply the entire market and the higher-price firm will sell nothing. If both firms charge the same price, consumers will be indifferent as to which firm they buy from and each firm will supply half the market.
What is the Nash equilibrium in this case? If you think about this problem a little, 
you will see that because of the incentive to cut prices, the Nash equilibrium is the competitive outcome—i.e., both firms set price equal to marginal cost: P
1 = P2 = $3. 
Then industry output is 27 units, of which each firm produces 13.5 units. And because price equals marginal cost, both firms earn zero profit. To check that this outcome is a Nash equilibrium, ask whether either firm would have any incentive to change its price. Suppose Firm 1 raised its price. It would then lose all of its sales to Firm 2 and therefore be no better off. If, instead, it lowered its price, it would capture the entire market but would lose money on every unit it produced; again, it would be worse off. Therefore, Firm 1 (and likewise Firm 2) has no incentive to deviate: It is doing the best it can to maximize profit, given what its competitor is doing.
Why couldn’t there be a Nash equilibrium in which the firms charged 
the same price, but a higher one (say, $5), so that each made some profit? Because if either firm lowered its price just a little, it could capture the entire market and nearly double its profit. Thus each firm would want to undercut its competitor. Such undercutting would continue until the price dropped to $3.
By changing the strategic choice variable from output to price, we get a 
 dramatically different outcome. In the Cournot model, because each firm pro-duces only 9 units, the market price is $12. Now the market price is $3. In the Cournot model, each firm made a profit; in the Bertrand model, the firms price at marginal cost and make no profit.
The Bertrand model has been criticized on several counts. First, when firms 
produce a homogeneous good, it is more natural to compete by setting quantities rather than prices. Second, even if firms do set prices and choose the same price 
(as the model predicts), what share of total sales will go to each one? We assumed  
that sales would be divided equally among the firms, but there is no reason why this must be the case. Despite these shortcomings, the Bertrand model is useful because it shows how the equilibrium outcome in an oligopoly can depend cru-cially on the firms’ choice of strategic variable.

Price Competition with Differentiated Products
Oligopolistic markets often have at least some degree of product differentia-tion.
3 Market shares are determined not just by prices, but also by differences in 
the design, performance, and durability of each firm’s product. In such cases, it is natural for firms to compete by choosing prices rather than quantities.
2Also, it has been shown that if firms produce a homogeneous good and compete by first setting out-
put capacities  and then setting price, the Cournot equilibrium in quantities again results. See David 
Kreps and Jose Scheinkman, “Quantity Precommitment and Bertrand Competition Yield Cournot Outcomes,” Bell Journal of Economics  14 (1983): 326–38.
3Product differentiation can exist even for a seemingly homogeneous product. Consider gasoline, for 
example. Although gasoline itself is a homogeneous good, service stations differ in terms of location and services provided. As a result, gasoline prices may differ from one service station to another.466  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
To see how price competition with differentiated products can work, let’s go 
through the following simple example. Suppose each of two duopolists has fixed costs of $20 but zero variable costs, and that they face the same demand curves:
 Firm
 1=s demand : Q1=12-2P1+P2 (12.5a)
 Firm  2=s demand : Q2=12-2P2+P1 (12.5b)
where P1 and P2 are the prices that Firms 1 and 2 charge, respectively, and Q1 
and Q2 are the resulting quantities that they sell. Note that the quantity that each 
firm can sell decreases when it raises its own price but increases when its com-petitor charges a higher price.
CHOOSING PRICES  We will assume that both firms set their prices at the same 
time and that each firm takes its competitor’s price as fixed. We can therefore use the Nash equilibrium concept to determine the resulting prices. Let’s begin with Firm 1. Its profit p
1 is its revenue P1Q1 less its fixed cost of $20. Substituting 
for Q1 from the demand curve of equation (12.5a), we have
p1=P1Q1-20=12P1-2P12+P1P2-20
At what price P1 is this profit maximized? The answer depends on P2, which Firm 1 
assumes to be fixed. However, whatever price Firm 2 is charging, Firm 1’s profit is maximized when the incremental profit from a very small increase in its own price is just zero. Taking P
2 as fixed, Firm 1’s profit-maximizing price is therefore given by
/H9004p1//H9004P1=12-4P1+P2=0
This equation can be rewritten to give the following pricing rule, or reaction 
curve , for Firm 1:
Firm  1=s reaction  curve : P1=3+1
4 P2
This equation tells Firm 1 what price to set, given the price P2 that Firm 2 is set-
ting. We can similarly find the following pricing rule for Firm 2:
Firm  2=s reaction  curve : P2=3+1
4 P1
These reaction curves are drawn in Figure 12.6. The Nash equilibrium is at the 
point where the two reaction curves cross; you can verify that each firm is then charging a price of $4 and earning a profit of $12. At this point, because each firm is 
doing the best it can given the price its competitor has set, neither firm has an incentive to change its price.
Now suppose the two firms collude: Instead of choosing their prices inde-
pendently, they both decide to charge the same price—namely, the price that maximizes both of their profits. You can verify that the firms would then charge $6, and that they would be better off colluding because each would now earn a profit of $16.
4 Figure 12.6 shows this collusive equilibrium.CHAPTER 12   •  Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly  467
4The firms have the same costs, so they will charge the same price P. Total profit is given by
pT=p1+p2=24P-4P2+2P2-40=24P-2P2-40.
This is maximized when /H9004pT//H9004P = 0. /H9004pT//H9004P = 24 − 4 P, so the joint profit-maximizing price is 
P = $6. Each firm’s profit is therefore

NASH EQUILIBRIUM IN PRICES
Here two firms sell a differentiated product, and 
each firm’s demand depends both on its own price and on its competitor’s price. The two firms choose their prices at the same time, each taking its competitor’s price as given. Firm 1’s reaction curve gives its profit-maximizing price as a func-tion of the price that Firm 2 sets, and similarly for Firm 2. The Nash equilibrium is at the intersec-tion of the two reaction curves: When each firm charges a price of $4, it is doing the best it can given its competitor’s price and has no incentive to change price. Also shown is the collusive equi-librium: If the firms cooperatively set price, they will choose $6.
EXAMPLE 12.2    A PRICING PROBLEM FOR PROCTER 
& GAMBLE
When Procter & Gamble (P&G) planned to enter the Japanese market for 
Gypsy Moth Tape, it knew its production costs and understood the market demand curve but found it hard to determine the right price to charge because two other firms—Kao, Ltd., and Unilever, Ltd.—were also planning to enter the market. All three firms would be choosing their prices at about the same time, and P&G had to take this into account when setting its own price.
5
5This example is based on classroom material developed by Professor John Hauser of MIT. To pro-
tect P&G’s proprietary interests, some of the facts about the product and the market have been altered. The fundamental description of P&G’s problem, however, is accurate.Finally, suppose Firm 1 sets its price first and that, after observing Firm 1’s deci-
sion, Firm 2 makes its pricing decision. Unlike the Stackelberg model in which the firms set their quantities, in this case Firm 1 would be at a distinct disadvantage  by 
moving first. (To see this, calculate Firm 1’s profit-maximizing price, taking Firm 
2’s reaction curve into account. ) Why is moving first now a disadvantage? Because it 
gives the firm that moves second an opportunity to undercut slightly and thereby capture a larger market share. (See Exercise 11 at the end of the chapter.)468  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
Because all three firms were using the same technology for producing 
Gypsy Moth Tape, they had the same production costs. Each firm faced a fixed cost of $480,000 per month and a variable cost of $1 per unit. From market research, P&G ascertained that its demand curve for monthly sales was
Q=3375 P
-3.5(PU).25(PK).25
where Q is monthly sales in thousands of units, and P, PU, and PK are P&G’s, 
Unilever’s, and Kao’s prices, respectively. Now, put yourself in P&G’s posi-tion. Assuming that Unilever and Kao face the same demand conditions, with 
what price should you enter the market, and how much profit should you expect to earn ?
You might begin by calculating the profit you would earn as a function of 
the price you charge, under alternative assumptions about the prices that Unilever and Kao will charge. Using the demand curve and cost numbers given above, we have done these calculations and tabulated the results in Table 12.2. Each entry shows your profit, in thousands of dollars per month, for a particular combination of prices (while assuming in each case that Unilever and Kao set the same price). For example, if you charge $1.30 and Unilever and Kao both charge $1.50, you will earn a profit of $15,000 per month.
But remember that in all likelihood, the managers of Unilever and Kao are 
making the same  calculations that you are and probably have their own ver-
sions of Table 12.2. Now suppose your competitors charge $1.50 or more. As the table shows, you would want to charge only $1.40, because that price gives you the highest profit. (For example, if they charged $1.50, you would make $29,000 per month by charging $1.40 but only $20,000 by charging $1.50, and $15,000 by charging $1.30.) Consequently, you would not want to charge $1.50 (or more). Assuming that your competitors have  followed the 
same reasoning, you should not expect them to charge $1.50 (or more) either.
What if your competitors charge $1.30? In that case, you will lose money, 
but you will lose the least amount of money ($6000 per month) by charging

6This Nash equilibrium can also be derived algebraically from the demand curve and cost data 
above. We leave this to you as an exercise.$1.40. Your competitors would therefore not expect you to charge $1.30, and 
by the same reasoning, you should not expect them to charge a price this low. What price lets you do the best you can, given your competitors’ prices? It is $1.40. This is also the price at which your competitors are doing the best they can, so it is a Nash equilibrium.
6 As the table shows, in this equilibrium 
you and your competitors each make a profit of $12,000 per month.
If you could collude  with your competitors, you could make a larger profit. 
You would all agree to charge $1.50, and each of you would earn $20,000. But this collusive agreement might be hard to enforce: You could increase your profit further at your competitor’s expense by dropping your price below theirs, and of course your competitors could do the same thing to you.
12.4   Competition versus Collusion: 
The Prisoners’ Dilemma
A Nash equilibrium is a noncooperative  equilibrium: Each firm makes the deci-
sions that give it the highest possible profit, given the actions of its competitors. As we have seen, the resulting profit earned by each firm is higher than it would be under perfect competition but lower than if the firms colluded.
Collusion, however, is illegal, and most managers prefer to stay out of jail. 
But if cooperation can lead to higher profits, why don’t firms cooperate without  
explicitly colluding? In particular, if you and your competitor can both figure out the profit-maximizing price you would agree to charge if you were to col-
lude, why not just set that price and hope your competitor will do the same ? If your 
competitor does do the same, you will both make more money.
The problem is that your competitor probably won’t  choose to set price at the 
collusive level. Why not? Because your competitor would do better by choosing a 
lower price, even if it knew that you were going to set price at the collusive level.
To understand this, let’s go back to our example of price competition from the 
last section. The firms in that example each have a fixed cost of $20, have zero variable cost, and face the following demand curves:
Firm  1
=s demand : Q1=12-2P1+P2
Firm  2=s demand : Q2=12-2P2+P1
We found that in the Nash equilibrium each firm will charge a price of $4 and 
earn a profit of $12, whereas if the firms collude, they will charge a price of $6 and earn a profit of $16. Now suppose that the firms do not collude, but that Firm 1 charges the $6 collusive price, hoping that Firm 2 will do the same. If Firm 2 does do the same, it will earn a profit of $16. But what if it charges the 
$4 price instead? In that case, Firm 2 would earn a profit of
p
2=P2Q2-20=(4)[12 -(2)(4) +6]-20=$20470  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
Firm 1, on the other hand, will earn a profit of only
p1=P1Q1-20=(6)[12 -(2)(6) +4]-20=$4
So if Firm 1 charges $6 but Firm 2 charges only $4, Firm 2’s profit will increase 
to $20. And it will do so at the expense of Firm 1’s profit, which will fall to $4. Clearly, Firm 2 does best by charging only $4. Similarly, Firm 1 does best by charging only $4. If Firm 2 charges $6 and Firm 1 charges $4, Firm 1 will earn a $20 profit and Firm 2 only $4.
PAYOFF MATRIX  Table 12.3 summarizes the results of these different possibili-
ties. In deciding what price to set, the two firms are playing a noncooperative 
game:  Each firm independently does the best it can, taking its competitor into 
account. Table 12.3 is called the payoff matrix  for this game because it shows the 
profit (or payoff) to each firm given its decision and the decision of its competitor. For example, the upper left-hand corner of the payoff matrix tells us that if both firms charge $4, each will make a $12 profit. The upper right-hand corner tells us that if Firm 1 charges $4 and Firm 2 charges $6, Firm 1 will make $20 and Firm 2 $4.
This payoff matrix can clarify the answer to our original question: Why don’t 
firms behave cooperatively, and thereby earn higher profits, even if they can’t collude? In this case, cooperating means both firms charging $6 instead of $4 
and thereby earning $16 instead of $12. The problem is that each firm always makes more money by charging $4, no matter what its competitor does.  As the pay-
off matrix shows, if Firm 2 charges $4, Firm 1 does best by charging $4. And if Firm 2 charges $6, Firm 1 still does best by charging $4. Similarly, Firm 2 always does best by charging $4, no matter what Firm 1 does. As a result, unless the two firms can sign an enforceable agreement to charge $6, neither firm can expect its competitor to charge $6, and both will charge $4.
THE PRISONERS’ DILEMMA  A classic example in game theory, called the pris-
oners’ dilemma,  illustrates the problem faced by oligopolistic firms. It goes as 
follows: Two prisoners have been accused of collaborating in a crime. They are in separate jail cells and cannot communicate with each other. Each has been asked to confess. If both prisoners confess, each will receive a prison term of five years. If neither confesses, the prosecution’s case will be difficult to make, so the prisoners can expect to plea bargain and receive terms of two years. On the other hand, if one prisoner confesses and the other does not, the one who confesses will receive a term of only one year, while the other will go to prison for 10 years. If you were one of these prisoners, what would you do—confess or not confess?
The payoff matrix in Table 12.4 summarizes the possible outcomes. (Note that 
the “payoffs” are negative; the entry in the lower right-hand corner means a • noncooperative game

two-year sentence for each prisoner.) As the table shows, our prisoners face a 
dilemma. If they could both agree not to confess (in a way that would be bind-ing), then each would go to jail for only two years. But they can’t talk to each other, and even if they could, can they trust each other? If Prisoner A does not 
confess, he risks being taken advantage of by his former accomplice. After all, no matter what Prisoner  A does, Prisoner  B comes out ahead by confessing.  Likewise, 
Prisoner A always comes out ahead by confessing, so Prisoner B must worry 
that by not confessing, she will be taken advantage of. Therefore, both prisoners will probably confess and go to jail for five years.
Oligopolistic firms often find themselves in a prisoners’ dilemma. They must 
decide whether to compete aggressively, attempting to capture a larger share of the market at their competitor’s expense, or to “cooperate” and compete more passively, coexisting with their competitors and settling for their current market share, and perhaps even implicitly colluding. If the firms compete passively, set-ting high prices and limiting output, they will make higher profits than if they compete aggressively.
Like our prisoners, however, each firm has an incentive to “fink” and undercut 
its competitors, and each knows that its competitors have the same incentive. As desirable as cooperation is, each firm worries—with good reason—that if it com-petes passively, its competitor might decide to compete aggressively and seize the lion’s share of the market. In the pricing problem illustrated in Table 12.3, 
both firms do better by “cooperating” and charging a high price. But the firms are in a prisoners’ dilemma, where neither can trust its competitor to set a high price.TABLE 12.4 PAYOFF MATRIX FOR PRISONERS’ DILEMMA

EXAMPLE 12.3   PROCTER & GAMBLE IN A PRISONERS’ DILEMMA
In Example 12.2, we examined the problem that 
arose when P&G, Unilever, and Kao Soap all planned to enter the Japanese market for Gypsy Moth Tape at the same time. They all faced the same cost and demand conditions, and each firm had to decide on a price that took its competitors into account. In Table 12.2, (page 468) we tabulated the profits to P&G corresponding to alternative prices that the firm and its competitors might charge. We argued that P&G should expect its competitors to charge a 
price of $1.40 and should do the same.
7
P&G would be better off if it and its competi-
tors all charged a price of $1.50. This is clear from 
the payoff matrix in Table 12.5. This payoff matrix is the portion of Table 12.2 corresponding to prices of $1.40 and $1.50, with the payoffs to P&G’s competitors also tabulated.
8 If all the firms charge 
$1.50, each will make a profit of $20,000 per month, 
7As in Example 12.2, some of the facts about the product and the market have been altered to protect 
P&G’s proprietary interests.472  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
instead of the $12,000 per month they make by 
charging $1.40. So why don’t they charge $1.50?
Because these firms are in a prisoners’ dilemma. 
No matter what Unilever and Kao do, P&G makes more money by charging $1.40. For example, if Unilever and Kao charge $1.50, P&G can make $29,000 per month by charging $1.40, versus $20,000 by charging $1.50. Unilever and Kao are in the same boat. For example, if P&G charges $1.50 and Unilever and Kao both charge $1.40, 
P&G’s competitors will each make $21,000, instead of $20,000.
9 As a result, P&G knows that if it sets 
a price of $1.50, its competitors will have a strong incentive to undercut and charge $1.40. P&G will then have only a small share of the market and make only $3000 per month profit. Should P&G make a leap of faith and charge $1.50? If you were faced with this dilemma, what would you do?
8This payoff matrix assumes that Unilever and Kao both charge the same price. Entries represent 
profits in thousands of dollars per month.TABLE 12.5 PAYOFF MATRIX FOR PRICING PROBLEM

9If P&G and Kao both charged $1.50 and only Unilever undercut and charged $1.40, Unilever would 
make $29,000 per month. It is especially profitable to be the only firm charging the low price.12.5   Implications of the Prisoners’ 
Dilemma for Oligopolistic Pricing
Does the prisoners’ dilemma doom oligopolistic firms to aggressive competition 
and low profits? Not necessarily. Although our imaginary prisoners have only one opportunity to confess, most firms set output and price over and over again, continually observing their competitors’ behavior and adjusting their own accordingly. This allows firms to develop reputations from which trust can arise. As a result, oligopolistic coordination and cooperation can sometimes prevail.
Take, for example, an industry made up of three or four firms that have 
coexisted for a long time. Over the years, the managers of those firms might grow tired of losing money because of price wars, and an implicit understand-ing might arise by which all the firms maintain high prices and no firm tries to take market share from its competitors. Although each firm might be tempted to undercut its competitors, its managers know that the resulting gains will be short lived: Competitors will retaliate, and the result will be renewed warfare and lower profits over the long run.
This resolution of the prisoners’ dilemma occurs in some industries, but not 
in others. Sometimes managers are not content with the moderately high profits resulting from implicit collusion and prefer to compete aggressively in order to increase market share. Sometimes implicit understandings are difficult to reach. For example, firms with different costs and different assessments of market demand might disagree about the “correct” collusive price. Firm A might think CHAPTER 12   •  Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly  473
the “correct” price is $10, while Firm B thinks it is $9. When it sets a $9 price, 
Firm A might view this as an attempt to undercut and retaliate by lowering its 
price to $8. The result is a price war.
In many industries, therefore, implicit collusion is short lived. There is often a 
fundamental layer of mistrust, so warfare erupts as soon as one firm is perceived by its competitors to be “rocking the boat” by changing its price or increasing advertising.
Price Rigidity
Because implicit collusion tends to be fragile, oligopolistic firms often have a strong desire for price stability. This is why price rigidity  can be a characteristic 
of oligopolistic industries. Even if costs or demand change, firms are reluctant to change price. If costs fall or market demand declines, they fear that lower prices might send the wrong message to their competitors and set off a price war. And if costs or demand rises, they are reluctant to raise prices because they are afraid that their competitors may not raise theirs.
Price rigidity is the basis of the kinked demand curve model  of oligopoly. 
According to this model, each firm faces a demand curve kinked at the currently prevailing price P*. (See Figure 12.7.) At prices above P*, the demand curve is 
very elastic. The reason is that the firm believes that if it raises its price above P*, other firms will not follow suit, and it will therefore lose sales and much of 
its market share. On the other hand, the firm believes that if it lowers its price below P*, other firms will follow suit because they will not want to lose their  
shares of the market. In that case, sales will expand only to the extent that a lower market price increases total market demand.
Because the firm’s demand curve is kinked, its marginal revenue curve is 
discontinuous. (The bottom part of the marginal revenue curve corresponds to the less elastic part of the demand curve, as shown by the solid portions of each curve.) As a result, the firm’s costs can change without resulting in a change in • price rigidity  Characteristic

THE KINKED DEMAND CURVE
Each firm believes that if it raises its price above 
the current price P*, none of its competitors will 
follow suit, so it will lose most of its sales. Each firm also believes that if it lowers price, everyone will follow suit, and its sales will increase only to the extent that market demand increases. As a  result, 
the firm’s demand curve D is kinked at price P*, 
and its marginal revenue curve MR is discontinu-ous at that point. If marginal cost  increases from 
MC to MC’, the firm will still produce the same output level Q* and charge the same price P*.474  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
price. As shown in Figure 12.7, marginal cost could increase but still equal mar-
ginal revenue at the same output level, so that price stays the same.
Although the kinked demand curve model is attractively simple, it does not 
really explain oligopolistic pricing. It says nothing about how firms arrived at price P* in the first place, and why they didn’t arrive at some different price. It is 
useful mainly as a description  of price rigidity rather than as an explanation  of it. 
The explanation for price rigidity comes from the prisoners’ dilemma and from firms’ desires to avoid mutually destructive price competition.
Price Signaling and Price Leadership
A big impediment to implicitly collusive pricing is the fact that it is difficult for firms to agree (without talking to each other) on what the price should be. Coordination is particularly difficult when cost and demand conditions—and thus the “correct” price—are changing. Price signaling  is a form of implicit 
collusion that sometimes gets around this problem. For example, a firm might announce that it has raised its price (perhaps through a press release) and hope that its competitors will take this announcement as a signal that they should also raise prices. If competitors follow suit, all of the firms will earn higher profits.
Sometimes a pattern is established whereby one firm regularly announces 
price changes and other firms in the industry follow suit. This pattern is called price leadership:  One firm is implicitly recognized as the “leader,” while the 
other firms, the “price followers,” match its prices. This behavior solves the problem of coordinating price: Everyone charges what the leader is charging.
Suppose, for example, that three oligopolistic firms are currently charging $10 
for their product. (If they all know the market demand curve, this might be the Nash equilibrium price.) Suppose that by colluding, they could all set a price of $20 and greatly increase their profits. Meeting and agreeing to set a price of $20 is illegal. But suppose instead that Firm A raises its price to $15, and announces 
to the business press that it is doing so because higher prices are needed to restore economic vitality to the industry. Firms B and C might view this as a clear 
 message—namely, that Firm A is seeking their cooperation in raising prices. They 
might then raise their own prices to $15. Firm A might then increase price fur-
ther—say, to $18—and Firms B and C might raise their prices as well. Whether 
or not the profit-maximizing price of $20 is reached (or surpassed), a pattern of coordination has been established that, from the firm’s point of view, may be nearly as effective as meeting and formally agreeing on a price.
10 
This example of signaling and price leadership is extreme and might lead to an 
antitrust lawsuit. But in some industries, a large firm might naturally emerge as a leader, with the other firms deciding that they are best off just matching the leader’s prices, rather than trying to undercut the leader or each other. An example is the U.S. automobile industry, where General Motors has traditionally been the price leader.
Price leadership can also serve as a way for oligopolistic firms to deal with 
the reluctance to change prices, a reluctance that arises out of the fear of being undercut or “rocking the boat.” As cost and demand conditions change, firms may find it increasingly necessary to change prices that have remained rigid for some time. In that case, they might look to a price leader to signal when and by how much price should change. Sometimes a large firm will naturally act as leader; sometimes different firms will act as leader from time to time. The example that follows illustrates this.• price signaling  Form of 
implicit collusion in which a firm announces a price increase in the hope that other firms will follow suit.
• price leadership  Pattern 
of pricing in which one firm regularly announces price changes that other firms then match.

Garth Saloner, “Collusive Price Leadership,” Journal of Industrial Economics , 1990; 93–111.CHAPTER 12   •  Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly  475
EXAMPLE 12.4    PRICE LEADERSHIP AND PRICE RIGIDITY IN COMMERCIAL 
BANKING
Commercial banks borrow money from individu-
als and companies who deposit funds in check-ing accounts, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit. They then use this money to make loans to household and corporate borrowers. By lending at an interest rate higher than the rate that they pay on their deposits, they earn a profit.
The largest commercial banks in the United 
States compete with each other to make loans to large corporate clients. The main form of compe-tition is over price—in this case, the interest rates they charge. If competition becomes aggressive, the interest rates fall, and so do profits. The incen-tive to avoid aggressive competition leads to price rigidity, and to a form of price  leadership.
The interest rate that banks charge large corporate 
clients is called the prime rate.  Because it is widely 
known, it is a convenient focal point for price  leadership. Most large banks charge the same or nearly the same 
prime rate; they avoid making frequent changes in the rate that might be destabilizing and lead to competi-tive warfare. The prime rate changes only when money market conditions cause other interest rates to rise or fall substantially. When that happens, one of the major banks announces a change in its rate and other banks quickly follow suit. Different banks act as leader from time to time, but when one bank announces a change, the others follow within two or three days.
Figure 12.8 compares the prime rate with the 
interest rate on high-grade (AAA) corporate bonds. Observe that although the corporate bond rate fluc-tuated continuously, there were extended periods during which the prime rate did the change. This is an example of price rigidity—banks are reluctant to change their lending rate for fear of being undercut and losing business to their competitors.

PRIME RATE VERSUS CORPORATE BOND RATE
The prime rate is the rate that major banks charge large corporate customers for short-term loans. It changes 
only infrequently because banks are reluctant to undercut one another. When a change does occur, it begins with one bank, and other banks quickly follow suit. The corporate bond rate is the return on long-term corporate bonds. Because these bonds are widely traded, this rate fluctuates with market conditions.476  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
EXAMPLE 12.5   THE PRICES OF COLLEGE TEXTBOOKS
If you bought this book new at a col-
lege bookstore in the United States, you probably paid something close to $200 for it. Now, there’s no doubt about it—this is a fantastic book! But $200? Why so much?
11
A quick visit to the bookstore will 
prove that the price of this book is not at all unusual. Most textbooks sold in the United States have retail prices in the $200 range. In fact even other microeconomics textbooks—which are clearly inferior to this one—sell for around $200. Publishing com-panies set the prices of their textbooks, so should we expect competition among publishers to drive down prices?
Partly because of mergers and acquisitions over 
the last decade or so, college textbook publish-ing is an oligopoly. (Pearson, the publisher of this book, is the largest college textbook publisher, followed by Cengage Learning and McGraw-Hill.) These publishers have an incentive 
to avoid a price war that could drive prices down. The best way to avoid a price war is to avoid discounting and to increase prices in lockstep on a regular basis.
The retail bookstore industry is 
also highly concentrated, and the retail markup on textbooks is around 30 percent. Thus a $200 retail price implies that the publisher is receiv-ing a net (wholesale) price of about $150. The elasticity of demand is low, because the instructor chooses the 
textbook, often disregarding the price. On the other hand, if the price is too high, some students will buy a used book or decide not to buy the book at all. In fact, it might be the case that publishers could earn more money by lowering  textbook prices. So 
why don’t they do that? First, that might lead to a dreaded price war. Second, publishers might not have read this book!
11You might have saved some money by buying the book via the Internet. If you bought the book 
used, or if you rented an electronic edition, you probably paid about half the U.S. retail price. And if you bought the International Student Edition of the book, which is paperback and only sold outside the U.S., you probably paid much less. For an updated list of the prices of intermediate microeco-nomics textbooks, go to http://theory.economics.utoronto.ca/poet/ .The Dominant Firm Model
In some oligopolistic markets, one large firm has a major share of total sales 
while a group of smaller firms supplies the remainder of the market. The large firm might then act as a dominant firm,  setting a price that maximizes its 
own profits. The other firms, which individually could have little influence over price, would then act as perfect competitors: They take the price set by the dominant firm as given and produce accordingly. But what price should the dominant firm set? To maximize profit, it must take into account how the output of the other firms depends on the price it sets.
Figure 12.9 shows how a dominant firm sets its price. Here, D is the mar-
ket demand curve, and S
F is the supply curve (i.e., the aggregate marginal 
cost curve) of the smaller fringe firms. The dominant firm must determine its 
demand curve DD. As the figure shows, this curve is just the difference between 
market demand and the supply of fringe firms. For example, at price P1, the 
supply of fringe firms is just equal to market demand; thus the dominant firm can sell nothing at this price. At a price P
2 or less, fringe firms will not supply 
any of the good, so the dominant firm faces the market demand curve. At prices between P
1 and P2, the dominant firm faces the demand curve DD.• dominant firm  Firm with a 
large share of total sales that sets price to maximize profits, taking into account the supply response of smaller firms.CHAPTER 12   •  Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly  477
Corresponding to DD is the dominant firm’s marginal revenue curve MRD. 
MCD is the dominant firm’s marginal cost curve. To maximize its profit, the 
dominant firm produces quantity QD at the intersection of MRD and MCD. From 
the demand curve DD, we find price P*. At this price, fringe firms sell a quantity 
QF; thus the total quantity sold is QT = QD + QF.
12.6  Cartels
Producers in a cartel  explicitly agree to cooperate in setting prices and output 
levels. Not all the producers in an industry need to join the cartel, and most 
cartels involve only a subset of producers. But if enough producers adhere to the cartel’s agreements, and if market demand is sufficiently inelastic, the cartel may drive prices well above competitive levels.
Cartels are often international. While U.S. antitrust laws prohibit American 
companies from colluding, those of other countries are much weaker and are 
sometimes poorly enforced. Furthermore, nothing prevents countries, or com-
panies owned or controlled by foreign governments, from forming cartels. For 
example, the OPEC cartel is an international agreement among oil-producing 
countries which has succeeded in raising world oil prices above competitive 
levels.
Other international cartels have also succeeded in raising prices. During the 
mid-1970s, for example, the International Bauxite Association (IBA) quadrupled bauxite prices, and a secretive international uranium cartel pushed up uranium prices. Some cartels had longer successes: From 1928 through the early 1970s, D

The dominant firm sets price, and the other firms

market demand D and the supply of fringe firms

at the point where its marginal revenue MRD is 
equal to its marginal cost MCD. The correspond-
ing price is P*. At this price, fringe firms sell QF, 
so that total sales equal QT.478  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
a cartel called Mercurio Europeo kept the price of mercury close to monopoly 
 levels, and an international cartel monopolized the iodine market from 1878 through 1939. However, most cartels have failed to raise prices. An international copper cartel operates to this day, but it has never had a significant impact on cop-per prices. Cartel attempts to drive up the prices of tin, coffee, tea, and cocoa have also failed.
12
CONDITIONS FOR CARTEL SUCCESS  Why do some cartels succeed while 
others fail? There are two conditions for cartel success. First, a stable cartel organization must be formed whose members agree on price and production levels and then adhere to that agreement. Unlike our prisoners in the prison-ers’ dilemma, cartel members can talk to each other to formalize an agreement. This does not mean, however, that agreeing is easy. Different members may have different costs, different assessments of market demand, and even dif-ferent objectives, and they may therefore want to set price at different levels. Furthermore, each member of the cartel will be tempted to “cheat” by lowering its price slightly to capture a larger market share than it was allotted. Most often, only the threat of a long-term return to competitive prices deters cheating of this sort. But if the profits from cartelization are large enough, that threat may be sufficient.
The second condition is the potential for monopoly power. Even if a cartel 
can solve its organizational problems, there will be little room to raise price if it faces a highly elastic demand curve. Potential monopoly power may be the most important condition for success; if the potential gains from cooperation are large, cartel members will have more incentive to solve their organizational problems.
Analysis of Cartel Pricing
Only rarely do all the producers of a good combine to form a cartel. A cartel 
usually accounts for only a portion of total production and must take into account the supply response of competitive (noncartel) producers when it sets price. Cartel pricing can thus be analyzed by using the dominant firm model  discussed earlier. We will apply this model to two cartels, the OPEC oil cartel and the CIPEC copper cartel.
13 This will help us understand why OPEC was suc-
cessful in raising price while CIPEC was not.
ANALYZING OPEC  Figure 12.10 illustrates the case of OPEC. Total demand 
TD is the total world demand curve for crude oil, and Sc is the competitive 
 (non-OPEC) supply curve. The demand for OPEC oil DOPEC is the difference 
between total demand and competitive supply, and MROPEC is the corresponding 
 marginal revenue curve. MCOPEC is OPEC’s marginal cost curve; as you can see, 
OPEC has much lower production costs than do non-OPEC producers. OPEC’s marginal revenue and marginal cost are equal at quantity Q
OPEC, which is the 
quantity that OPEC will produce. We see from OPEC’s demand curve that the price will be P*, at which competitive supply is Q
c.
Suppose petroleum-exporting countries had not formed a cartel but had 
instead produced competitively. Price would then have equaled marginal cost. We can therefore determine the competitive price from the point where OPEC’s Recall from §10.2 that 
monopoly power refers to market power on the part of a seller—the ability of a firm to price its product above its marginal cost of production.
12See Jeffrey K. MacKie-Mason and Robert S. Pindyck, “Cartel Theory and Cartel Experience in 
International Minerals Markets,” in Energy: Markets and Regulation  (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1986).
13CIPEC is the French acronym for International Council of Copper Exporting Countries.CHAPTER 12   •  Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly  479
demand curve intersects its marginal cost curve. That price, labeled Pc, is much 
lower than the cartel price P*. Because both total demand and non-OPEC sup-
ply are inelastic, the demand for OPEC oil is also fairly inelastic. Thus the cartel has substantial monopoly power, and it has used that power to drive prices well above competitive levels.
In Chapter 2, we stressed the importance of distinguishing between  short-run 
and long-run supply and demand. That distinction is important here. The total demand and non-OPEC supply curves in Figure 12.10 apply to a short- or inter-mediate-run analysis. In the long run, both demand and supply will be much more elastic, which means that OPEC’s demand curve will also be much more elastic. We would thus expect that in the long run OPEC would be unable to maintain a price that is so much above the competitive level. Indeed, during 1982–1989, oil prices fell in real terms, largely because of the long-run adjust-ment of demand and non-OPEC supply.
ANALYZING CIPEC  Figure 12.11 provides a similar analysis of CIPEC, 
which consists of four copper-producing countries: Chile, Peru, Zambia, and Congo (formerly Zaire), that collectively account for less than half of world copper production. In these countries, production costs are lower than those of  non-CIPEC producers, but except for Chile, not much lower. In  
Figure 12.11, CIPEC’s marginal cost curve is therefore drawn only a little below the  non-CIPEC  supply curve. CIPEC’s demand curve D
CIPEC is the differ-
ence between total demand TD and non-CIPEC supply Sc. CIPEC’s marginal 
cost and marginal revenue curves intersect at quantity QCIPEC, with the corre-
sponding price P*. Again, the  competitive price Pc is found at the point where 
CIPEC’s demand curve intersects its marginal cost curve. Note that this price is very close to the cartel price P*.
Why can’t CIPEC increase copper prices much? As Figure 12.11 shows, the 
total demand for copper is more elastic than that for oil. (Other materials, such DOPEC

as aluminum, can easily be substituted for copper.) Also, competitive supply is 
much more elastic. Even in the short run, non-CIPEC producers can easily expand supply if prices should rise (in part because of the availability of  supply from scrap metal). Thus CIPEC’s potential monopoly power is small.
As the examples of OPEC and CIPEC illustrate, successful cartelization requires 
two things. First, the total demand for the good must not be very price elastic. Second, either the cartel must control nearly all the world’s supply or, if it does not, the supply of noncartel producers must not be price elastic. Most international commodity cartels have failed because few world markets meet both conditions.DCIPECMCCIPECScTD

EXAMPLE 12.6   THE CARTELIZATION OF INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS
Many people think of intercolle-
giate athletics as an extracurricular activity for college students and a diversion for fans. They assume that universities support athletics because it not only gives amateur athletes a chance to develop their skills and play football or basket-ball before large audiences but also provides entertainment and promotes school spirit and alumni support. Although it does these things, intercollegiate athletics is also a big—and an extremely profitable—industry.
Like any industry, intercollegiate athletics has 
firms and  consumers. The “firms” ar e the univer sities that support and finance teams. 
The inputs to production are the coaches, student athletes, and capital in the form of stadiums and  playing fields. The  consumers, 
many of whom are current or  former college  students, are the 
fans who buy tickets to games and the TV and radio networks 
that pay to broadcast them. There are many firms and consumers, which suggests that the industry is competitive. But the persistently high level of profits in this industry is inconsistent with competition—a large state university can regularly earn more than $6 million a year in profits from football games 
CHAPTER 12   •  Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly  481
14See “In Big-Time College Athletics, the Real Score Is in Dollars,” New York Times , March 1, 1987.alone.14 This profitability is the result of monopoly 
power, obtained via cartelization.
The cartel organization is the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association (NCAA). The NCAA restricts  competition in a number of important ways. To reduce 
bargaining power by student athletes, the NCAA  creates and enforces rules regarding eligibility and 
terms of compensation. To reduce competition by uni-versities, it limits the number of games that can be played each season and the number of teams that can participate in each division. And to limit price compe-tition, the NCAA positioned itself as the sole negotia-tor of all football television contracts, thereby monop-olizing one of the main sources of industry  revenues. 
The NCAA was forced to end this practice in 1984.
Has the NCAA been a successful cartel? Like most 
cartels, its members have occasionally broken its rules and regulations. But until 1984, it was success-ful in increasing the monopoly power of the college basketball industry well above what it would have been otherwise. In 1984, however, the Supreme Court ruled that the NCAA’s monopolization of  
football television contracts was illegal, allowing indi-vidual universities to negotiate their own  contracts. 
The ensuing competition led to an increase in the amount of college football shown on television, but a drop in the contract fees paid to schools, which has resulted in a decrease in the total revenues to schools. All in all, although the Supreme Court’s ruling reduced 
the NCAA’s monopoly power, it did not eliminate it. The NCAA still negotiates fees for other televised col-legiate sports; in 2010, CBS and Turner Broadcasting signed a $10.8 billion deal with the NCAA to cover the Division I Men’s Basketball Championship for 14 years. At the same time, the Association continued a 2001 deal with ESPN to allow coverage of 11 nonrevenue sports (including the Division I Women’s Basketball Championship, soccer, men’s ice hockey, and the College World Series). The original deal called for ESPN to pay the NCAA $200 million over 11 years.
The NCAA’s anticompetitive practices have come 
under numerous attacks. In 2005, the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), a college basketball tour-nament operated by the Metropolitan Intercollegiate Basketball Committee, challenged the NCAA’s rule that effectively forced schools invited to its tourna-ment to boycott the NIT. The NIT claimed that this practice was anticompetitive and an illegal use of the NCAA’s powers. The parties ultimately settled the lawsuit for nearly $60 million. In 2007, the NCAA was sued by 11,500 Division I football and basket-ball players claiming that it illegally fixed the price of an athletic scholarship below the cost of a college education. According to the players, the NCAA short-changed them, on average, $2,500 a year because of its arbitrary limit on scholarships.
EXAMPLE 12.7   THE MILK CARTEL
The U.S. government has sup-ported the price of milk since the Great Depression and continues to do so today. The government, how-ever, scaled back price supports during the 1990s, and as a result, wholesale prices of milk have fluctu-ated more widely. Not surprisingly, farmers have been complaining.
In response to these complaints, in 1996 the federal 
government allowed milk producers in the six New England states to cartelize. The cartel—called the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact—set minimum  
wholesale prices for milk, and was exempt from the antitrust laws. The result was that 
consumers in New England paid more for a gallon of milk than con-sumers elsewhere in the nation.
In 1999, Congress responded 
to the lobbying efforts of farm-ers in other states by attempt-ing to expand the milk cartel. Legislation was introduced 
that would have allowed dairy farmers in New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania to join the New England states and 
thereby form a cartel covering most of the northeast  
United States.
15 Not wanting to be left out, dairy 
482  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
 farmers in the South also lobbied Congress for higher 
milk prices. As a result, the 1999 legislation also autho-rized 16 southern states, including Texas, Florida, and Georgia, to create their own regional cartel.
Studies have suggested that the original cartel (cov-
ering only the New England states) has caused retail prices of milk to rise by only a few cents a gallon. Why so little? The reason is that the New England cartel is sur-rounded by a fringe of noncartel  producers—namely, 
dairy farmers in New York, New Jersey, and other states. Expanding the cartel, however, would have shrunk the competitive fringe, thereby giving the car-
tel a greater  influence over milk prices.
Recognizing the political headaches and regional 
conflict caused by these attempts at cartelization, Congress ended the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact in October 2001. Although proponents of the Compact attempted to revive the cartel, oppo-sition in Congress has been strong and, as of 2011, the cartel has not been re-authorized. Nonetheless, milk production continues to benefit from federal price supports.
SUMMARY
 1. In a monopolistically competitive market, firms com-
pete by selling differentiated products, which are highly substitutable. New firms can enter or exit easily. Firms have only a small amount of monopoly power. In the long run, entry will occur until profits are driven to zero. Firms then produce with excess capacity (i.e., at output levels below those that minimize average cost).
 2. In an oligopolistic market, only a few firms account 
for most or all of production. Barriers to entry allow some firms to earn substantial profits, even over the long run. Economic decisions involve strategic consid-erations—each firm must consider how its actions will affect its rivals, and how they are likely to react.
 3. In the Cournot model of oligopoly, firms make their 
output decisions at the same time, each taking the other’s output as fixed. In equilibrium, each firm is maximizing its profit, given the output of its com-petitor, so no firm has an incentive to change its out-put. The firms are therefore in a Nash equilibrium. Each firm’s profit is higher than it would be under perfect competition but less than what it would earn by colluding.
 4. In the Stackelberg model, one firm sets its output first. 
That firm has a strategic advantage and earns a higher profit. It knows that it can choose a large output and that its competitors will have to choose smaller out-
puts if they want to maximize profits.
 5. The Nash equilibrium concept can also be applied to 
markets in which firms produce substitute goods and compete by setting price. In equilibrium, each firm maximizes its profit, given the prices of its competi-tors, and so has no incentive to change price.
 6. Firms would earn higher profits by collusively agreeing 
to raise prices, but the antitrust laws usually prohibit 
this. They might all set high prices without colluding, 
each hoping its competitors will do the same, but they are in a prisoners’ dilemma, which makes this unlikely. Each firm has an incentive to cheat by lowering its price and capturing sales from competitors.
 7. The prisoners’ dilemma creates price rigidity in oli-
gopolistic markets. Firms are reluctant to change prices for fear of setting off price warfare.
 8. Price leadership is a form of implicit collusion that 
sometimes gets around the prisoners’ dilemma. One firm sets price and other firms follow suit.
 9. In a cartel, producers explicitly collude in setting 
prices and output levels. Successful cartelization requires that the total demand not be very price elastic, and that either the cartel control most supply or else the supply of noncartel producers be inelastic.
QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW

petitive market? What happens to the equilibrium price and quantity in such a market if one firm intro-duces a new, improved product?
 2. Why is the firm’s demand curve flatter than the total 
market demand curve in monopolistic competition? Suppose a monopolistically competitive firm is  making 
a profit in the short run. What will happen to its demand curve in the long run?

EXERCISES
 1. Suppose all firms in a monopolistically competitive 
industry were merged into one large firm. Would that new firm produce as many different brands? Would it produce only a single brand? Explain.
 2. Consider two firms facing the demand curve 
P = 50 − 5 Q, where Q = Q
1 + Q2. The firms’ cost func-
tions are C1(Q1) = 20 + 10 Q1 and C2(Q2) = 10 + 12 Q2.
 a. Suppose both firms have entered the industry. What 
is the joint profit-maximizing level of output? How much will each firm produce? How would your answer change if the firms have not yet entered the industry?
 b. What is each firm’s equilibrium output and profit 
if they behave noncooperatively? Use the Cournot model. Draw the firms’ reaction curves and show the equilibrium.
 c. How much should Firm 1 be willing to pay to pur-
chase Firm 2 if collusion is illegal but a takeover is not?
 3. A monopolist can produce at a constant average (and 
marginal) cost of AC = MC = $5. It faces a market demand curve given by Q = 53 − P.
 a. Calculate the profit-maximizing price and quantity 
for this monopolist. Also calculate its profits.
 b. Suppose a second firm enters the market. Let Q
1 be 
the output of the first firm and Q2 be the  output of 
the second. Market demand is now given by
Q1+Q2=53-P
Assuming that this second firm has the same costs 
as the first, write the profits of each firm as func-tions of Q
1 and Q2.
 c. Suppose (as in the Cournot model) that each firm 
chooses its profit-maximizing level of output on the assumption that its competitor’s output is fixed. Find each firm’s “reaction curve” (i.e., the rule that gives its desired output in terms of its competitor’s output). d. Calculate the Cournot equilibrium (i.e., the values 
of Q
1 and Q2 for which each firm is doing as well as 
it can given its competitor’s output). What are the resulting market price and profits of each firm?
  *e.  Suppose there are N firms in the industry, all with 
the same constant marginal cost, MC = $5. Find the Cournot equilibrium. How much will each firm produce, what will be the market price, and how much profit will each firm earn? Also, show that as N becomes large, the market price approaches 
the price that would prevail under perfect  competition.
 4. This exercise is a continuation of Exercise 3. We 
return to two firms with the same constant average and marginal cost, AC = MC = 5, facing the market demand curve Q
1 + Q2 = 53 − P. Now we will use 
the Stackelberg model to analyze what will happen if one of the firms makes its output decision before the other.
 a. Suppose Firm 1 is the Stackelberg leader (i.e., makes 
its output decisions before Firm 2). Find the reac-tion curves that tell each firm how much to produce in terms of the output of its competitor.
 b. How much will each firm produce, and what will 
its profit be?
 5. Two firms compete in selling identical widgets. They 
choose their output levels Q
1 and Q2 simultaneously 
and face the demand curve
P=30-Q
where Q = Q1 + Q2. Until recently, both firms had zero 
marginal costs.  Recent environmental regulations have 
increased Firm 2’s marginal cost to $15. Firm 1’s mar-ginal cost remains constant at zero. True or false: As a result, the market price will rise to the monopoly  level.
 6. Suppose that two identical firms produce widgets and 
that they are the only firms in the market. Their costs  4. Why is the Cournot equilibrium stable? (i.e., Why 
don’t firms have any incentive to change their output levels once in equilibrium?) Even if they can’t collude, why don’t firms set their outputs at the joint profit-maximizing levels (i.e., the levels they would have chosen had they colluded)?
 5. In the Stackelberg model, the firm that sets output first 
has an advantage. Explain why.
 6. What do the Cournot and Bertrand models have in 
common? What is different about the two models?
 7. Explain the meaning of a Nash equilibrium when 
firms are competing with respect to price. Why is the equilibrium stable? Why don’t the firms raise prices to the level that maximizes joint profits? 8. The kinked demand curve describes price rigid-
ity. Explain how the model works. What are its  limitations? Why does price rigidity occur in oligopo-listic markets?
 9. Why does price leadership sometimes evolve in oli-
gopolistic markets? Explain how the price leader determines a profit-maximizing price.
 10. Why has the OPEC oil cartel succeeded in raising 
prices substantially while the CIPEC copper cartel has not? What conditions are necessary for successful  cartelization? What organizational problems must a cartel overcome?484  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
are given by C1 = 60 Q1 and C2 = 60 Q2, where Q1 is the 
output of Firm 1 and Q2 the output of Firm 2. Price is 
determined by the following demand curve:
P=300-Q
where Q = Q1 + Q2.
 a. Find the Cournot-Nash equilibrium. Calculate the 
profit of each firm at this equilibrium.
 b. Suppose the two firms form a cartel to maximize 
joint profits. How many widgets will be produced? Calculate each firm’s profit.
 c. Suppose Firm 1 were the only firm in the industry. 
How would market output and Firm 1’s profit dif-fer from that found in part (b) above?
 d. Returning to the duopoly of part (b), suppose Firm 
1 abides by the agreement but Firm 2 cheats by increasing production. How many widgets will Firm 2 produce? What will be each firm’s profits?
 7. Suppose that two competing firms, A and B, produce a 
homogeneous good. Both firms have a marginal cost of MC = $50. Describe what would happen to output and price in each of the following situations if the firms are at (i) Cournot equilibrium, (ii) collusive equilibrium, and (iii) Bertrand equilibrium.
 a. Because Firm A must increase wages, its MC 
increases to $80.
 b. The marginal cost of both firms increases.
 c. The demand curve shifts to the right.
 8. Suppose the airline industry consisted of only two 
firms: American and Texas Air Corp. Let the two firms have identical cost functions, C(q) = 40 q. Assume 
that the demand curve for the industry is given by  P = 100 − Q and that each firm expects the other to 
behave as a Cournot competitor.
 a. Calculate the Cournot-Nash equilibrium for each 
firm, assuming that each chooses the output level that maximizes its profits when taking its rival’s output as given. What are the profits of each firm?
 b. What would be the equilibrium quantity if Texas 
Air had constant marginal and average costs of $25 and American had constant marginal and average costs of $40?
 c. Assuming that both firms have the original cost 
function, C(q) = 40 q, how much should Texas Air be 
willing to invest to lower its marginal cost from 40 to 25, assuming that American will not follow suit? How much should American be willing to spend to reduce its marginal cost to 25, assuming that Texas Air will have marginal costs of 25 regardless of American’s actions?

The market demand for these seat covers is repre-
sented by the inverse demand equation

 a. If each firm acts to maximize its profits, taking its

they could do a lot better by colluding. If the two firms collude, what will be the profit-maximizing choice of output? The industry price? The output and the profit for each firm in this case?
 c. The managers of these firms realize that explicit 
agreements to collude are illegal. Each firm must decide on its own whether to produce the Cournot quantity or the cartel quantity. To aid in making the decision, the manager of WW constructs a payoff CHAPTER 12   •  Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly  485

and
Q2=20+P1-P2
where P1 and P2 are the prices charged by each firm, 
respectively, and Q1 and Q2 are the resulting demands. 
Note that the demand for each good depends only on the difference in prices; if the two firms colluded and set the same price, they could make that price as high as they wanted, and earn infinite profits. Marginal costs are zero.

 *12. The dominant firm model can help us understand 
the behavior of some cartels. Let’s apply this model to the OPEC oil cartel. We will use isoelastic curves to describe world demand W and noncartel (com-
petitive) supply S. Reasonable numbers for the price 
elasticities of world demand and noncartel supply are −1/2 and 1/2, respectively. Then, expressing W 
and S in millions of barrels per day (mb/d), we could 
write
W=160P-1/2
and
S=(3 1

Note that OPEC’s net demand is D = W − S.
 a. Draw the world demand curve W, the non-OPEC 
supply curve S, OPEC’s net demand curve D, and 
OPEC’s marginal revenue curve. For purposes of approximation, assume OPEC’s production cost is zero. Indicate OPEC’s optimal price, OPEC’s optimal production, and non-OPEC production on the diagram. Now, show on the diagram how the various curves will shift and how OPEC’s optimal price will change if non-OPEC supply becomes more expensive because reserves of oil start running out.
 b. Calculate OPEC’s optimal (profit-maximizing) 
price. ( Hint : Because OPEC’s cost is zero, just write 
the expression for OPEC revenue and find the price that maximizes it.)

TC is in hundreds of dollars, and Q is in cartons per 
month picked and shipped. a. Tabulate total, average, and marginal costs for each 
firm for output levels between 1 and 5 cartons per month (i.e., for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 cartons).
 b. If the cartel decided to ship 10 cartons per month 
and set a price of $25 per carton, how should out-put be allocated among the firms?

In Chapter 12, we began to explore some of the strategic output and 
pricing decisions that firms must often make. We saw how a firm can take into account the likely responses of its competitors when 
it makes these decisions. However, there are many questions about market structure and firm behavior that we have not yet addressed. For example, why do firms tend to collude in some markets and to compete aggressively in others? How do some firms manage to deter entry by potential competitors? And how should firms make pricing decisions when demand or cost conditions are changing or new com-petitors are entering the market?
To answer these questions, we will use game theory to extend our 
analysis of strategic decision making. The application of game theory has been an important development in microeconomics. This chap-ter explains some key aspects of this theory and shows how it can be used to understand how markets evolve and operate, and how managers should think about the strategic decisions they continu-ally face. We will see, for example, what happens when oligopolistic firms must set and adjust prices strategically over time, so that the prisoners’ dilemma, which we discussed in Chapter 12, is repeated over and over. We will show how firms can make strategic moves that give them advantages over competitors or an edge in bargain-ing situations, and how they can use threats, promises, or more con-crete actions to deter entry. Finally, we will turn to auctions and see  how game theory can be applied to auction design and bidding  strategies.
13.1  Gaming and Strategic Decisions
First, we should clarify what gaming and strategic decision making are all about. A game  is any situation in which players  (the partici-
pants) make strategic decisions —i.e., decisions that take into account 
each other’s actions and responses. Examples of games include firms  competing with each other by setting prices, or a group of consumers bidding against each other at an auction for a work of art. Strategic decisions result in payoffs  to the players: outcomes that generate 
rewards or benefits. For the price-setting firms, the payoffs are profits; 13.1

for the  bidders at the auction, the winner’s payoff is her consumer surplus—i.e., 
the value she places on the artwork less the amount she must pay.
A key objective of game theory is to determine the optimal strategy for each 
player. A strategy  is a rule or plan of action for playing the game. For our price-
setting firms, a strategy might be: “I’ll keep my price high as long as my com-petitors do the same, but once a competitor lowers his price, I’ll lower mine even more.” For a bidder at an auction, a strategy might be: “I’ll make a first bid of $2000 to convince the other bidders that I’m serious about winning, but I’ll drop out if other bidders push the price above $5000.” The optimal strategy  for 
a player is the one that maximizes the expected payoff.
We will focus on games involving players who are rational , in the sense that 
they think through the consequences of their actions. In essence, we are con-cerned with the following question: If I believe that my competitors are rational 
and act to maximize their own payoffs, how should I take their behavior into account when making my decisions?  In real life, of course, you may encounter competi-
tors who are irrational, or are less capable than you of thinking through the consequences of their actions. Nonetheless, a good place to start is by assuming that your competitors are just as rational and just as smart as you are.
1 As we 
will see, taking competitors’ behavior into account is not as simple as it might seem. Determining optimal strategies can be difficult, even under conditions of complete symmetry and perfect information (i.e., my competitors and I have the same cost structure and are fully informed about each others’ costs, about demand, etc.). Moreover, we will be concerned with more complex situations in which firms face different costs, different types of information, and various degrees and forms of competitive “advantage” and “disadvantage.”
Noncooperative versus Cooperative Games
The economic games that firms play can be either cooperative  or noncooperative.  In 
a cooperative game , players can negotiate binding contracts that allow them to 
plan joint strategies. In a noncooperative game , negotiation and enforcement of 
binding contracts are not possible.
An example of a cooperative game is the bargaining between a buyer and 
a seller over the price of a rug. If the rug costs $100 to produce and the buyer  values the rug at $200, a cooperative solution to the game is possible: An agree-ment to sell the rug at any price between $101 and $199 will maximize the sum of the buyer’s consumer surplus and the seller’s profit, while making both par-ties better off. Another cooperative game would involve two firms negotiating a joint investment to develop a new technology (assuming that neither firm would have enough know-how to succeed on its own). If the firms can sign a binding contract to divide the profits from their joint investment, a cooperative outcome that makes both parties better off is possible.

1When we asked, 80 percent of our students told us that they were smarter and more capable than 
most of their classmates. We hope that you don’t find it too much of a strain to imagine competing against people who are as smart and capable as you are.
2Bargaining over a rug is called a constant sum  game because no matter what the selling price, the 
sum of consumer surplus and profit will be the same. Negotiating over a joint venture is a noncon-
stant sum  game: The total profit that results from the venture will depend on the outcome of the 
negotiations (e.g., the resources that each firm devotes to the venture).CHAPTER 13   •  Game Theory and Competitive Strategy  489
setting their prices. Each firm knows that by undercutting its competitor, it can 
capture more market share. But it also knows that in doing so, it risks setting off a price war. Another noncooperative game is the auction mentioned above: Each bidder must take the likely behavior of the other bidders into account when determining an optimal bidding strategy.
Note that the fundamental difference between cooperative and noncoop-
erative games lies in the contracting possibilities.  In cooperative games, binding 
 contracts are possible; in noncooperative games, they are not.
We will be concerned mostly with noncooperative games. Whatever the 
game, however, keep in mind the following key point about strategic decision making:
It is essential to understand your opponent’s point of view and to deduce his or her 
likely responses to your actions.
This point may seem obvious—of course, one must understand an  opponent’s 
point of view. Yet even in simple gaming situations, people often ignore or misjudge opponents’ positions and the rational responses that those positions imply.
HOW TO BUY A DOLLAR BILL  Consider the following game devised by 
Martin Shubik.
3 A dollar bill is auctioned, but in an unusual way. The highest 
bidder receives the dollar in return for the amount bid. However, the second-highest bidder must also hand over the amount that he or she bid—and get nothing in return. If you were playing this game, how much would you bid for the 
dollar bill?
Classroom experience shows that students often end up bidding more than a 
dollar for the dollar. In a typical scenario, one player bids 20 cents and another 30 cents. The lower bidder now stands to lose 20 cents but figures he can earn a dollar by raising his bid, and so bids 40 cents. The escalation continues until two players carry the bidding to a dollar against 90 cents. Now the 90-cent bidder has to choose between bidding $1.10 for the dollar or paying 90 cents to get nothing. Most often, he raises his bid, and the bidding escalates further. In some experi-ments, the “winning” bidder has ended up paying more than $3 for the dollar!
How could intelligent students put themselves in this position? By failing 
to think through the likely response of the other players and the sequence of events it implies.
In the rest of this chapter, we will examine simple games that involve 
pricing, advertising, and investment decisions. The games are simple in that, given some behavioral assumptions , we can determine the best strategy 
for each firm. But even for these simple games, we will find that the cor-rect behavioral assumptions are not always easy to make. Often they will depend on how the game is played (e.g., how long the firms stay in business, their reputations, etc.). Therefore, when reading this chapter, you should try to understand the basic issues involved in making strategic decisions. You should also keep in mind the importance of carefully assessing your opponent’s position and rational response to your actions, as Example 13.1 illustrates.

In §12.4, we explain that 
a payoff matrix is a table showing the payoffs to each player given her decision and the decision of her  competitor.13.2  Dominant Strategies
How can we decide on the best strategy for playing a game? How can we deter-
mine a game’s likely outcome? We need something to help us determine how the rational behavior of each player will lead to an equilibrium solution. Some strategies may be successful if competitors make certain choices but fail if they make other choices. Other strategies, however, may be successful regardless of what competitors do. We begin with the concept of a dominant strategy —one 
that is optimal no matter what an opponent does.
The following example illustrates this in a duopoly setting. Suppose Firms A 
and B sell competing products and are deciding whether to undertake adver-
tising campaigns. Each firm will be affected by its competitor’s decision. The possible outcomes of the game are illustrated by the payoff matrix in Table 13.1. (Recall that the payoff matrix summarizes the possible outcomes of the game; the first number in each cell is the payoff to A and the second is the payoff to B.) 
Observe that if both firms advertise, Firm A will earn a profit of 10 and Firm B 
a profit of 5. If Firm A advertises and Firm B does not, Firm A will earn 15 and 
Firm B zero. The table also shows the outcomes for the other two possibilities.• dominant strategy  Strategy 
that is optimal no matter what an 
opponent does.
4This is a revised version of an example designed by Max Bazerman for a course at MIT.EXAMPLE 13.1   ACQUIRING A COMPANY
You represent Company A (the acquirer), which is 
considering acquiring Company T (the target).4 You 
plan to offer cash for all of Company T’s shares, but 
you are unsure what price to offer. The complica-tion is this: The value of Company T—indeed, its 
viability—depends on the outcome of a major oil exploration project. If the project fails, Company T 
under current management will be worth nothing. But if it succeeds, Company T’s value under current 
management could be as high as $100/share. All share values between $0 and $100 are considered equally likely.
It is well known, however, that Company T will be 
worth much more under the progressive manage-ment of Company A than under current manage-
ment. In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, Company T will be worth 50 
percent more under the management of Company A. If the project fails, Company T is worth $0/share 
under either management. If the exploration proj-ect generates a $50/share value under current man-agement, the value under Company A will be $75/
share. Similarly, a $100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A, 
and so on.You must determine what price Company A 
should offer for Company T’s shares. This offer must 
be made now—before  the outcome of the explora-
tion project is known. From all indications, Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A—
for the right price.  You expect Company T to delay a 
decision on your bid until the exploration results are in and then accept or reject your offer before news of the drilling results reaches the press.
Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results 
of the exploration project when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when deciding whether to accept your offer. Also, Company T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of the company under current management.  As the representative 
of Company A, you are considering price offers in 
the range $0/share (i.e., making no offer at all) to $150/share. What price per share should you offer 
for Company T’s stock?
Note:  The typical response—to offer between 
$50 and $75 per share—is wrong. The correct answer to this problem appears at the end of this chapter, but we urge you to try to answer it on  
your own.CHAPTER 13   •  Game Theory and Competitive Strategy  491
What strategy should each firm choose? First consider Firm A. It should 
clearly advertise because no matter what firm B does, Firm A does best by 
advertising. If Firm B advertises, A earns a profit of 10 if it advertises but only 
6 if it doesn’t. If B does not advertise, A earns 15 if it advertises but only 10 if it 
doesn’t. Thus advertising is a dominant strategy for Firm A. The same is true for 
Firm B: No matter what firm A does, Firm B does best by advertising. Therefore, 
assuming that both firms are rational, we know that the outcome for this game is that both firms will advertise.  This outcome is easy to determine because both 
firms have dominant strategies.
When every player has a dominant strategy, we call the outcome of the 
game an equilibrium in dominant strategies . Such games are straightforward 
to  analyze because each player’s optimal strategy can be determined without  worrying about the actions of the other players.
Unfortunately, not every game has a dominant strategy for each player. To see 
this, let’s change our advertising example slightly. The payoff matrix in Table 13.2 is the same as in Table 13.1 except for the bottom right-hand corner—if neither firm advertises, Firm B will again earn a profit of 2, but Firm A will earn a profit 
of 20. (Perhaps Firm A’s ads are expensive and largely designed to refute Firm 
B’s claims, so by not advertising, Firm A can reduce its expenses considerably.)
Now Firm A has no dominant strategy. Its optimal decision depends on what 
Firm B does.  If Firm B advertises, Firm A does best by advertising; but if Firm B 
does not advertise, Firm A also does best by not advertising. Now suppose both 
firms must make their decisions at the same time. What should Firm A do?
To answer this, Firm A must put itself in Firm B’s shoes. What decision is best 
from Firm B’s point of view, and what is Firm B likely to do? The answer is clear: 
Firm B has a dominant strategy—advertise, no matter what Firm A does. (If 
Firm A advertises, B earns 5 by advertising and 0 by not advertising; if A doesn’t 
advertise, B earns 8 if it advertises and 2 if it doesn’t.) Therefore, Firm A can con-
clude that Firm B will advertise. This means that Firm A should advertise (and 
thereby earn 10 instead of 6). The logical outcome of the game is that both firms 
will advertise because Firm A is doing the best it can given Firm B’s decision; 
and Firm B is doing the best it can given Firm A’s decision.• equilibrium in dominant

13.3  The Nash Equilibrium Revisited
To determine the likely outcome of a game, we have been seeking “self-enforc-
ing,” or “stable” strategies. Dominant strategies are stable, but in many games, one or more players do not have a dominant strategy. We therefore need a more general equilibrium concept. In Chapter 12, we introduced the concept of a Nash 
equilibrium  and saw that it is widely applicable and intuitively appealing.
5
Recall that a Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies (or actions) such that each 
player is doing the best it can given the actions of its opponents.  Because each player 
has no incentive to deviate from its Nash strategy, the strategies are stable. In the example shown in Table 13.2, the Nash equilibrium is that both firms advertise: Given the decision of its competitor, each firm is satisfied that it has made the best decision possible, and so has no incentive to change its decision.
In Chapter 12, we used the Nash equilibrium to study output and pricing by 
oligopolistic firms. In the Cournot model, for example, each firm sets its own output while taking the outputs of its competitors as fixed. We saw that in a Cournot equilibrium, no firm has an incentive to change its output unilaterally because each firm is doing the best it can given the decisions of its competitors. Thus a Cournot equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium.
6 We also examined mod-
els in which firms choose price, taking the prices of their competitors as fixed. Again, in the Nash equilibrium, each firm is earning the largest profit it can given the prices of its competitors, and thus has no incentive to change its price.
It is helpful to compare the concept of a Nash equilibrium with that of an 
equilibrium in dominant strategies:
Dominant Strategies : I’m doing the best I can no matter what you do .
 You’re doing the best you can no matter what I do .
Nash Equilibrium : I’m doing the best I can given what you are doing .
 You’re doing the best you can given what I am doing .
Note that a dominant strategy equilibrium is a special case of a Nash 
 equilibrium.
In the advertising game of Table 13.2, there is a single Nash equilibrium—both 
firms advertise. In general, a game need not have a single Nash equilibrium. Sometimes there is no Nash equilibrium, and sometimes there are  several (i.e., several sets of strategies are stable and self-enforcing). A few more  examples will help to clarify this.
THE PRODUCT CHOICE PROBLEM  Consider the following “product choice” 
problem. Two breakfast cereal companies face a market in which two new varia-tions of cereal can be successfully introduced—provided that each variation is introduced by only one firm. There is a market for a new “crispy” cereal and a In §12.2, we explain that 
the Cournot equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium in which each firm correctly assumes how much its competitor will produce.
5Our discussion of the Nash equilibrium, and of game theory in general, is at an introductory level. 
For a more in-depth discussion of game theory and its applications, see James W. Friedman, Game 
Theory with Applications to Economics  (New York: Oxford University Press, 1990); Drew Fudenberg 
and Jean Tirole, Game Theory  (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1991); and Avinash Dixit, David Reiley, Jr., 
and Susan Skeath, Games of Strategy , 3rd ed. (New York: Norton, 2009).
6A Stackelberg equilibrium  is also a Nash equilibrium. In the Stackelberg model, however, the rules of 
the game are different: One firm makes its output decision before its competitor does. Under these rules, each firm is doing the best it can given the decision of its competitor.CHAPTER 13   •  Game Theory and Competitive Strategy  493
market for a new “sweet” cereal, but each firm has the resources to introduce 
only one new product. The payoff matrix for the two firms might look like the one in Table 13.3.
In this game, each firm is indifferent about which product it produces—so 
long as it does not introduce the same product as its competitor. If coordina-tion were possible, the firms would probably agree to divide the market. But what if the firms must behave noncooperatively ? Suppose that somehow—per-
haps through a news release—Firm 1 indicates that it is about to introduce the sweet cereal, and that Firm 2 (after hearing this) announces its plan to introduce the crispy one. Given the action that it believes its opponent to be taking, nei-ther firm has an incentive to deviate from its proposed action. If it takes the proposed action, its payoff is 10, but if it deviates—and its opponent’s action remains unchanged—its payoff will be -5. Therefore, the strategy set given by 
the bottom left-hand corner of the payoff matrix is stable and constitutes a Nash equilibrium: Given the strategy of its opponent, each firm is doing the best it can and has no incentive to deviate.
Note that the upper right-hand corner of the payoff matrix is also a Nash 
equilibrium, which might occur if Firm 1 indicated that it was about to produce the crispy cereal. Each Nash equilibrium is stable because once the strategies are 
chosen , no player will unilaterally deviate from them. However, without more 
information, we have no way of knowing which  equilibrium (crispy/sweet vs. 
sweet/crispy) is likely to result—or if either  will result. Of course, both firms 
have a strong incentive to reach one of the two Nash equilibria—if they both 
introduce the same type of cereal, they will both lose money. The fact that the two firms are not allowed to collude does not mean that they will not reach a Nash equilibrium. As an industry develops, understandings often evolve as firms “signal” each other about the paths the industry is to take.
THE BEACH LOCATION GAME  Suppose that you ( Y) and a competitor ( C) 
plan to sell soft drinks on a beach this summer. The beach is 200 yards long, and sunbathers are spread evenly across its length. You and your competitor sell the same soft drinks at the same prices, so customers will walk to the closest vendor. Where on the beach will you locate, and where do you think your competitor will locate?
If you think about this for a minute, you will see that the only Nash equi-
librium calls for both you and your competitor to locate at the same spot in the center of the beach (see Figure 13.1). To see why, suppose your competitor located at some other point ( A), which is three quarters of the way to the end 
of the beach. In that case, you would no longer want to locate in the center; you would locate near your competitor, just to the left. You would thus capture nearly three-fourths of all sales, while your competitor got only the remaining fourth. This outcome is not an equilibrium because your competitor would then want to move to the center of the beach, and you would do the same.TABLE 13.3 PRODUCT CHOICE PROBLEM

The “beach location game” can help us understand a variety of phenom-
ena. Have you ever noticed how, along a two- or three-mile stretch of road, two or three gas stations or several car dealerships will be located close to each other? Likewise, as a U.S. presidential election approaches, the Democratic and Republican candidates typically move close to the center as they define their political positions.
Maximin Strategies
The concept of a Nash equilibrium relies heavily on individual rationality. Each player’s choice of strategy depends not only on its own rationality, but also on the rationality of its opponent. This can be a limitation, as the example in Table 13.4 shows.
In this game, two firms compete in selling file-encryption software. Because 
both firms use the same encryption standard, files encrypted by one firm’s soft-ware can be read by the other’s—an advantage for consumers. Nonetheless, Firm 1 has a much larger market share. (It entered the market earlier and its soft-ware has a better user interface.) Both firms are now considering an investment in a new encryption standard.
Note that investing is a dominant strategy for Firm 2 because by doing so it 
will do better regardless of what Firm 1 does. Thus Firm 1 should expect Firm 2 to invest. In this case, Firm 1 would also do better by investing (and earning Y

$20 million) than by not investing (and losing $10 million). Clearly the outcome 
(invest, invest) is a Nash equilibrium for this game, and you can verify that it is the only Nash equilibrium. But note that Firm 1’s managers had better be sure that Firm 2’s managers understand the game and are rational. If Firm 2 should happen to make a mistake and fail to invest, it would be extremely costly to Firm 1. (Consumer confusion over incompatible standards would arise, and Firm 1, with its dominant market share, would lose $100 million.)
If you were Firm 1, what would you do? If you tend to be cautious—and if 
you are concerned that the managers of Firm 2 might not be fully informed or rational—you might choose to play “don’t invest.” In that case, the worst that can happen is that you will lose $10 million; you no longer have a chance of los-ing $100 million. This strategy is called a maximin strategy  because it maximizes 
the minimum gain that can be earned.  If both firms used maximin strategies, the 
outcome would be that Firm 1 does not invest and Firm 2 does. A maximin strat-egy is conservative, but it is not profit-maximizing. (Firm 1, for example, loses $10 million rather than earning $20 million.) Note that if Firm 1 knew for certain  
that Firm 2 was using a maximin strategy, it would prefer to invest (and earn $20 million) instead of following its own maximin strategy of not investing.
MAXIMIZING THE EXPECTED PAYOFF  If Firm 1 is unsure about what Firm 2 
will do but can assign probabilities to each feasible action for Firm 2, it could instead use a strategy that maximizes its expected payoff.  Suppose, for example, that Firm 
1 thinks that there is only a 10-percent chance that Firm 2 will not invest. In that case, Firm 1’s expected payoff from investing is (.1)( /H11002100) + (.9)(20) = $8 million. 
Its expected payoff if it doesn’t invest is (.1)(0) + (.9)( /H1100210) = /H11002$9 million. In this 
case, Firm 1 should invest.
On the other hand, suppose Firm 1 thinks that the probability that Firm 2 
will not invest is 30 percent. Then Firm 1’s expected payoff from investing is (.3)(/H11002100) + (.7)(20) = /H11002$16 million, while its expected payoff from not investing is 
(.3)(0) + (.7)( /H1100210) = /H11002$7 million. Thus Firm 1 will choose not to invest.
You can see that Firm 1’s strategy depends critically on its assessment of the 
probabilities of different actions by Firm 2. Determining these probabilities may seem like a tall order. However, firms often face uncertainty (over market con-ditions, future costs, and the behavior of competitors), and must make the best decisions they can based on probability assessments and expected values.
THE PRISONERS’ DILEMMA  What is the Nash equilibrium for the prisoners’ 
dilemma discussed in Chapter 12? Table 13.5 shows the payoff matrix for the prisoners’ dilemma. Recall that the ideal outcome is one in which neither pris-oner confesses, so that both get two years in prison. Confessing, however, is a dominant strategy  for each prisoner—it yields a higher payoff regardless of the 
strategy of the other prisoner. Dominant strategies are also maximin strategies. • maximin strategy  Strategy 
that maximizes the minimum gain that can be earned.
For a review of expected value, see §5.1, where it is defined as a weighted average of the payoffs asso-ciated with all possible out-comes, with the probabilities of each outcome used as weights.

Therefore, the outcome in which both prisoners confess is both a Nash equilib-
rium and a maximin solution. Thus, in a very strong sense, it is rational for each prisoner to confess.
*Mixed Strategies
In all of the games that we have examined so far, we have considered strategies in which players make a specific choice or take a specific action: advertise or don’t advertise, set a price of $4 or a price of $6, and so on. Strategies of this kind are called pure strategies . There are games, however, in which a pure strategy is 
not the best way to play.
MATCHING PENNIES  An example is the game of “Matching Pennies.” In 
this game, each player chooses heads or tails and the two players reveal their coins at the same time. If the coins match (i.e., both are heads or both are tails), Player A wins and receives a dollar from Player B. If the coins do not match, 
Player B wins and receives a dollar from Player A. The payoff matrix is shown 
in Table 13.6.
Note that there is no Nash equilibrium in pure strategies for this game. 
Suppose, for example, that Player A chose the strategy of playing heads. Then 
Player B would want to play tails. But if Player B plays tails, Player A would 
also want to play tails. No combination of heads or tails leaves both players sat-isfied—one player or the other will always want to change strategies.
Although there is no Nash equilibrium in pure strategies, there is a Nash 
equilibrium in mixed strategies : strategies in which players make random choices 
among two or more possible actions, based on sets of chosen probabilities.  In this game, 
for example, Player A might simply flip the coin, thereby playing heads with 
probability 1/2 and playing tails with probability 1/2. In fact, if Player A fol-
lows this strategy and Player B does the same, we will have a Nash equilib-
rium: Both players will be doing the best they can given what the opponent is doing. Note that although the outcome is random, the expected payoff  is 0 for 
each player.
It may seem strange to play a game by choosing actions randomly. But put 
yourself in the position of Player A and think what would happen if you followed 
a strategy other  than just flipping the coin. Suppose you decided to play heads. If 
Player B knows this, she would play tails and you would lose. Even if Player B 
didn’t know your strategy, if the game were played repeatedly, she could even-tually discern your pattern of play and choose a strategy that countered it. Of course, you would then want to change your strategy—which is why this would not be a Nash equilibrium. Only if you and your opponent both choose heads or tails randomly with probability 1/2 would neither of you have any incentive to change strategies. (You can check that the use of different probabilities, say 3/4 for heads and 1/4 for tails, does not generate a Nash equilibrium.)• pure strategy  Strategy in 
which a player makes a specific choice or takes a specific action.
• mixed strategy  Strategy in 
which a player makes a random choice among two or more possible actions, based on a set of chosen probabilities.

One reason to consider mixed strategies is that some games (such as 
“Matching Pennies”) do not have any Nash equilibria in pure strategies. It can be shown, however, that once we allow for mixed strategies, every  game has at 
least one Nash equilibrium.
7 Mixed strategies, therefore, provide solutions to 
games when pure strategies fail. Of course, whether solutions involving mixed strategies are reasonable will depend on the particular game and players. Mixed strategies are likely to be very reasonable for “Matching Pennies,” poker, and other such games. A firm, on the other hand, might not find it reasonable to believe that its competitor will set its price randomly.
THE BATTLE OF THE SEXES  Some games have Nash equilibria both in pure 
strategies and in mixed strategies. An example is “The Battle of the Sexes,” a game that you might find familiar. It goes like this. Jim and Joan would like to spend Saturday night together but have different tastes in entertainment. Jim would like to go to the opera, but Joan prefers mud wrestling. As the payoff matrix in Table 13.7 shows, Jim would most prefer to go to the opera with Joan, but prefers watching mud wrestling with Joan to going to the opera alone, and similarly for Joan.
First, note that there are two Nash equilibria in pure strategies for this game—
the one in which Jim and Joan both watch mud wrestling, and the one in which they both go to the opera. Joan, of course, would prefer the first of these out-comes and Jim the second, but both outcomes are equilibria—neither Jim nor Joan would want to change his or her decision, given the decision of the other.
This game also has an equilibrium in mixed strategies: Joan chooses wres-
tling with probability 2/3 and opera with probability 1/3, and Jim chooses wrestling with probability 1/3 and opera with probability 2/3. You can check that if Joan uses this strategy, Joan cannot do better with any other strategy, and vice versa.
8 The outcome is random, and Jim and Joan will each have an 
expected payoff of 2/3.
Should we expect Jim and Joan to use these mixed strategies? Unless 
they’re very risk loving or in some other way a strange couple, probably not. By agreeing to either form of entertainment, each will have a payoff of at least 1, which exceeds the expected payoff of 2/3 from randomizing. In this game TABLE 13.7 THE BATTLE OF THE SEXES

Wrestling Opera
JoanWrestling 2, 1 0, 0

7More precisely, every game with a finite number of players and a finite number of actions has 
at least one Nash equilibrium. For a proof, see David M. Kreps, A Course in Microeconomic Theory  
(Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1990), p. 409.
8Suppose Joan randomizes, letting p be the probability of wrestling and (1 -p) the probability 
of opera. Because Jim is using probabilities of 1/3 for wrestling and 2/3 for opera, the proba-bility that both will choose wrestling is (1/3) p, and the probability that both will choose opera is 
(2/3)(1 -p). Thus, Joan’s expected payoff is 2(1/3) p + 1(2/3)(1 -p) = (2/3) p + 2/3
-(2/3) p = 2/3. 
This payoff is independent of p, so Joan cannot do better in terms of expected payoff no matter what 
she chooses.498  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
as in many others, mixed strategies provide another solution, but not a very 
realistic one. Hence, for the remainder of this chapter we will focus on pure strategies.
13.4  Repeated Games
We saw in Chapter 12 that in oligopolistic markets, firms often find themselves in a prisoners’ dilemma when making output or pricing decisions. Can firms find a way out of this dilemma, so that oligopolistic coordination and coopera-tion (whether explicit or implicit) could prevail?
To answer this question, we must recognize that the prisoners’ dilemma, as 
we have described it so far, is limited: Although some prisoners may have only one opportunity in life to confess or not, most firms set output and price over and over again. In real life, firms play repeated games : Actions are taken and 
payoffs received over and over again. In repeated games, strategies can become more complex. For example, with each repetition of the prisoners’ dilemma, each firm can develop a reputation about its own behavior and can study the behavior of its competitors.
How does repetition change the likely outcome of the game? Suppose 
you are Firm 1 in the prisoners’ dilemma illustrated by the payoff matrix in  
Table 13.8. If you and your competitor both charge a high price, you will both make a higher profit than if you both charged a low price. However, you are afraid to charge a high price because if your competitor charges a low price, you will lose money and, to add insult to injury, your competitor will get rich. But suppose this game is repeated over and over again—for example, you and your competitor simultaneously announce your prices on the first day of every month. Should you then play the game differently, perhaps changing your price over time in response to your competitor’s behavior?
In an interesting study, Robert Axelrod asked game theorists to come up 
with the best strategy they could think of to play this game in a repeated manner.
9 (A possible strategy might be: “I’ll start off with a high price, 
then lower my price. But then if my competitor lowers his price, I’ll raise mine for a while before lowering it again, etc.”) Then, in a computer simula-tion, Axelrod played these strategies off against one another to see which worked best.
TIT-FOR-TAT STRATEGY  As you would expect, any given strategy would 
work better against some strategies than it would against others. The objec-tive, however, was to find the strategy that was most robust—that would • repeated game  Game in 
which actions are taken and payoffs received over and over again.

work best on average against all, or almost all, other strategies. The result 
was surprising. The strategy that worked best was an extremely simple  tit-for-tat strategy : I start out with a high price, which I maintain so long as 
you continue to “cooperate” and also charge a high price. As soon as you lower your price, however, I follow suit and lower mine. If you later decide to cooperate and raise your price again, I’ll immediately raise my price  as well.
Why does this tit-for-tat strategy work best? In particular, can I expect that 
using the tit-for-tat strategy will induce my competitor to behave cooperatively (and charge a high price)?
INFINITELY REPEATED GAME  Suppose the game is infinitely repeated.  In 
other words, my competitor and I repeatedly set prices month after month, forever.  Cooperative behavior (i.e., charging a high price) is then the rational 
response to a tit-for-tat strategy. (This assumes that my competitor knows, or can figure out, that I am using a tit-for-tat strategy.) To see why, suppose that in one month my competitor sets a low price and undercuts me. In that month he will make a large profit. But my competitor knows that the follow-ing month I will set a low price, so that his profit will fall and will remain low as long as we both continue to charge a low price. Because the game is infi-nitely repeated, the cumulative loss of profits that results must outweigh any short-term gain that accrued during the first month of undercutting. Thus, it is not rational to undercut.
In fact, with an infinitely repeated game, my competitor need not even be 
sure that I am playing tit-for-tat to make cooperation its own rational strat-egy. Even if my competitor believes there is only some  chance that I am playing 
tit-for-tat, he will still find it rational to start by charging a high price and main-tain it as long as I do. Why? With infinite repetition of the game, the expected  
gains from cooperation will outweigh those from undercutting. This will be true even if the probability that I am playing tit-for-tat (and so will continue cooperating) is small.
FINITE NUMBER OF REPETITIONS  Now suppose the game is repeated a finite  
number of times—say, N months. ( N can be large as long as it is finite.) If my 
competitor (Firm 2) is rational and believes that I am rational , he will reason as fol-
lows: “Because Firm 1 is playing tit-for-tat, I (Firm 2) cannot undercut—that is, until the last month.  I should  undercut the last month because then I can make a 
large profit that month, and afterward the game is over, so Firm 1 cannot retali-ate. Therefore, I will charge a high price until the last month, and then I will charge a low price.”
However, since I (Firm 1) have also figured this out, I also plan to charge 
a low price in the last month. Of course, Firm 2 can figure this out as well, and therefore knows  that I will charge a low price in the last month. But 
then what about the next-to-last month? Because there will be no coopera-tion in the last month, anyway, Firm 2 figures that it should undercut and charge a low price in the next-to-last month. But, of course, I have figured this out too, so I also plan to charge a low price in the next-to-last month. 
And because the same reasoning applies to each preceding month, the game unravels : The only rational outcome is for both of us to charge a low price 
every month.
TIT-FOR-TAT IN PRACTICE  Since most of us do not expect to live forever, 
the unravelling argument would seem to make the tit-for-tat strategy of  little • tit-for-tat strategy
Repeated-game strategy in 
which a player responds in kind to an opponent’s previous play, cooperating with cooperative opponents and retaliating against uncooperative ones.500  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
value, leaving us stuck in the prisoners’ dilemma. In practice, however, tit- 
for-tat can sometimes work and cooperation can prevail. There are two  primary reasons.
First, most managers don’t know how long they will be competing with 
their rivals, and this also serves to make cooperative behavior a good strategy. If the end point of the repeated game is unknown, the unraveling argument that begins with a clear expectation of undercutting in the last month no lon-ger applies. As with an infinitely repeated game, it will be rational to play tit-for-tat.
Second, my competitor might have some doubt about the extent of my 
 rationality. Suppose my competitor thinks  (and he need not be certain) 
that I am playing tit-for-tat. He also thinks that perhaps  I am playing tit-
for-tat “blindly,” or with limited rationality, in the sense that I have failed to work out the logical implications of a finite time horizon as discussed above. My competitor thinks, for example, that perhaps I have not figured out that he will undercut me in the last month, so that I should also charge a low price in the last month, and so on. “ Perhaps,”  thinks my competitor, 
“Firm 1 will play tit-for-tat blindly, charging a high price as long as I charge a high price.” Then (if the time horizon is long enough), it is rational for my competitor to maintain a high price until the last month (when he will undercut me).
Note that we have stressed the word perhaps.  My competitor need not be sure 
that I am playing tit-for-tat “blindly,” or even that I am playing tit-for-tat at all. Just the possibility  can make cooperative behavior a good strategy (until near 
the end) if the time horizon is long enough. Although my competitor’s conjec-ture about how I am playing the game might be wrong, cooperative behavior is profitable in expected value terms.  With a long time horizon, the sum of current 
and future profits, weighted by the probability that the conjecture is correct, can exceed the sum of profits from price competition, even if my competitor is the first to undercut. After all, if I am wrong and my competitor charges a low price, I can shift my strategy at the cost of only one period’s profit—a minor cost in light of the substantial profit that I can make if we both choose to set a high price.
Thus, in a repeated game, the prisoners’ dilemma can have a cooperative 
outcome. In most markets, the game is in fact repeated over a long and uncer-tain length of time, and managers have doubts about how “perfectly ratio-nally” they and their competitors operate. As a result, in some industries,  particularly those in which only a few firms compete over a long period under stable demand and cost conditions, cooperation prevails, even though no con-tractual arrangements are made. (The water meter industry, discussed below, is an example.) In many other industries, however, there is little or no cooperative behavior.
Sometimes cooperation breaks down or never begins because there are too 
many firms. More often, failure to cooperate is the result of rapidly shifting demand or cost conditions. Uncertainties about demand or costs make it dif-ficult for the firms to reach an implicit understanding of what cooperation should entail. (Remember that an explicit  understanding, arrived at through 
meetings and discussions, could lead to an antitrust violation.) Suppose, for example, that cost differences or different beliefs about demand lead one firm to conclude that cooperation means charging $50 while a second firm thinks it means $40. If the second firm charges $40, the first firm might view that as a grab for market share and respond in tit-for-tat fashion with a $35 price. A price war could then develop.CHAPTER 13   •  Game Theory and Competitive Strategy  501
EXAMPLE 13.2    OLIGOPOLISTIC COOPERATION IN THE WATER 
METER INDUSTRY
For some four decades, almost all 
the water meters sold in the United States have been produced by four American companies: Rockwell International, Badger Meter, Neptune Water Meter Company, and Hersey Products.
10 Most buy-
ers of water meters are munici-pal water utilities, who install the meters in residential and commercial establishments in order to measure water consumption and bill con-sumers accordingly. Because the cost of meters is a small part of the total cost of providing water, utilities are concerned mainly that the meters be accurate and reliable. Price is not a primary issue, and demand is very inelastic. Demand is also very stable; because every residence or business must have a water meter, demand grows slowly along with the population.
In addition, utilities tend to have long-standing 
relationships with suppliers and are reluctant to shift from one to another. Because any new entrant will find it difficult to lure customers from existing firms, this creates a barrier to entry. Substantial economies of scale create a second barrier to entry: To capture a significant share of the market, a new entrant must invest in a large factory. This require-ment virtually precludes entry by new firms.With inelastic and stable 
demand and little threat of entry by new firms, the existing four firms could earn substantial monopoly profits if they set prices cooperatively. If, on the other hand, they compete aggres-sively, with each firm cutting price to increase its own share of the 
market, profits would fall to nearly competitive lev-els. The firms thus face a prisoners’ dilemma. Can cooperation prevail?
It can and has prevailed. Remember that the same 
four firms have been playing a repeated game  for 
decades. Demand has been stable and predictable, and over the years, the firms have been able to assess their own and each other’s costs. In this situation, tit-for-tat strategies work well: It pays each firm to coop-erate as long as its competitors are cooperating.
As a result, the four firms operate as though they 
were members of a country club. There is rarely an attempt to undercut price, and each firm appears satisfied with its share of the market. While the busi-ness may appear dull, it is certainly profitable. All four firms have been earning returns on their invest-ments that far exceed those in more competitive industries.
10This example is based in part on Nancy Taubenslag, “Rockwell International,” Harvard Business 
School Case No. 9-383-019, July 1983. In the late 1980s, Rockwell split up and sold its water meter division to British Tyre & Rubber, which later became part of Invensys, a multinational company that markets water meters in the United States under the Foxboro brand. Hersey became a subsid-iary of Mueller Products in 1999, but still sells meters under the Hersey name. Badger and Neptune continue to operate as stand-alone companies.EXAMPLE 13.3    COMPETITION AND COLLUSION IN THE AIRLINE 
INDUSTRY
In March 1983, American Airlines 
proposed that all airlines adopt a uniform fare schedule based on mileage. The rate per mile would depend on the length of the trip, with the lowest rate of 15 cents per mile for trips over 2500 miles, higher rates for shorter 
trips, and the highest rate, 53 cents per mile, for trips under 250 miles. For example, a one-way coach ticket from Boston to Chicago, a distance of 932 miles, would cost 
502  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
$233 (based on a rate of 25 cents per mile for trips 
between 751 and 1000 miles).
This proposal would have done away with the 
many different fares (some heavily discounted) then available. The cost of a ticket from one city to another would depend only on the number of miles between those cities. As a senior vice-presi-dent of American Airlines said, “The new stream-lined fare structure will help reduce fare confusion.” Most other major airlines reacted favorably to the plan and began to adopt it. A vice-president of TWA said, “It’s a good move. It’s very businesslike.” United Airlines quickly announced that it would adopt the plan on routes where it competes with American, which included most of its system, and TWA and Continental said that they would adopt it for all their routes.
11
Why did American propose this plan, and what 
made it so attractive to the other airlines? Was it really to “help reduce fare confusion”? No, the aim was to reduce price competition and achieve a col-lusive pricing arrangement. Prices had been driven down by competitive undercutting, as airlines com-peted for market share. And as Robert Crandall had learned less than a year earlier, fixing prices over the telephone is illegal. Instead, the companies would implicitly fix prices by agreeing to use the same fare-setting formula.
The plan failed, a victim of the prisoners’ 
dilemma. Only two weeks after the plan was announced and adopted by most airlines, Pan Am, which was dissatisfied with its small share of the U.S. market, dropped its fares. American, United, and TWA, afraid of losing their own shares of the market, quickly dropped their fares to match Pan Am. The price-cutting continued, and fortunately for consumers, the plan was soon dead.American Airlines introduced another simpli-
fied, four-tier fare structure in April 1992, which was quickly adopted by most major carriers. But it, too, soon fell victim to competitive discounts. In May 1992, Northwest Airlines announced a “kids fly free” program, and American responded with a summer half-price sale, which other carri-ers matched. As a result, the airline industry lost  billions.
Why is airline pricing so intensively competi-
tive? Airlines plan route capacities two or more years into the future, but they make pricing deci-sions over short horizons—month by month or even week by week. In the short run, the mar-ginal cost of adding passengers to a flight is very low—essentially the cost of a soft drink and a bag of peanuts. Each airline, therefore, has an incen-tive to lower fares in order to capture passengers from its competitors. In addition, the demand for air travel often fluctuates unpredictably. Such fac-tors as these stand in the way of implicit price cooperation.
Thus, aggressive competition has continued 
to be the rule in the airline industry. In fact, pric-ing has become even more competitive in recent years. First, discount airlines—such as Southwest and JetBlue—have attracted millions of price-conscious consumers and forced the major carri-ers to cut fares. Second, during periods of sluggish demand, airlines are compelled to reduce prices in order to attract consumers. Finally, Internet ser-vices such as Expedia, Orbitz, and Travelocity have promoted “fare shopping” by online consumers and encouraged more competitive pricing. These developments have forced several major airlines into bankruptcy and resulted in record losses for the industry.

American’s Fare Plan,” New York Times , March 17, 1983.13.5  Sequential Games
In most of the games we have discussed so far, both players move at the same 
time. In the Cournot model of duopoly, for example, both firms set output at the same time. In sequential games , players move in turn. The Stackelberg model 
discussed in Chapter 12 is an example of a sequential game; one firm sets output before the other does. There are many other examples: an advertising decision • sequential game  Game 
in which players move in turn, responding to each other’s actions and reactions.CHAPTER 13   •  Game Theory and Competitive Strategy  503
by one firm and the response by its competitor; entry-deterring investment by 
an incumbent firm and the decision whether to enter the market by a potential competitor; or a new government regulatory policy and the investment and out-put response of the regulated firms.
We will look at a variety of sequential games in the remainder of this chapter. 
As we will see, they are often easier to analyze than games in which the players move at the same time. In a sequential game, the key is to think through the pos-sible actions and rational reactions of each player.
As a simple example, let’s return to the product choice problem first dis-
cussed in Section 13.3. This problem involves two companies facing a market in which two new variations of breakfast cereal can be successfully introduced as long as each firm introduces only one variation. This time, let’s change the payoff matrix slightly. As Table 13.9 shows, the new sweet cereal will inevitably be a better seller than the new crispy cereal, earning a profit of 20 rather than 10 (perhaps because consumers prefer sweet things to crispy things). Both new cereals will still be profitable, however, as long as each is introduced by only one firm. (Compare Table 13.9 with Table 13.3—page 493.)
Suppose that both firms, in ignorance of each other’s intentions, must 
announce their decisions independently and simultaneously. In that case, both will probably introduce the sweet cereal—and both will lose money.
Now suppose that Firm 1 can gear up its production faster and introduce its 
new cereal first. We now have a sequential game: Firm 1 introduces a new cereal, and then Firm 2 introduces one. What will be the outcome of this game? When 
making its decision, Firm 1 must consider the rational response of its competi-tor. It knows that whichever cereal it introduces, Firm 2 will introduce the other kind. Thus it will introduce the sweet cereal, knowing that Firm 2 will respond by introducing the crispy one.
The Extensive Form of a Game
Although this outcome can be deduced from the payoff matrix in Table 13.9, sequential games are sometimes easier to visualize if we represent the pos-sible moves in the form of a decision tree. This representation is called the  extensive form of a game  and is shown in Figure 13.2. The figure shows the 
possible choices of Firm 1 (introduce a crispy or a sweet cereal) and the pos-sible responses of Firm 2 to each of those choices. The resulting payoffs are given at the end of each branch. For example, if Firm 1 produces a crispy cereal and Firm 2 responds by also producing a crispy cereal, each firm will have a payoff of -5.
To find the solution to the extensive form game, work backward from the end. 
For Firm 1, the best sequence of moves is the one in which it earns 20 and Firm 2 earns 10. Thus it can deduce that it should produce the sweet cereal because Firm 2’s best response is then to produce the crispy cereal.• extensive form of a

The Advantage of Moving First
In this product-choice game, there is a clear advantage to moving first: By 
introducing the sweet cereal, Firm 1 leaves Firm 2 little choice but to introduce the crispy one. This is much like the first-mover advantage that we saw in the Stackelberg model in Chapter 12. In that model, the firm that moves first can choose a large level of output, thereby giving its competitor little choice but to choose a small level.
To clarify the nature of this first-mover advantage, it will be useful to review 
the Stackelberg model and compare it to the Cournot model in which both firms choose their outputs simultaneously. As in Chapter 12, we will use the example in which two duopolists face the market demand curve
P=30-Q
where Q is the total production, i.e., Q = Q
1 + Q2. As before, we will also assume 
that both firms have zero marginal cost. Recall that the Cournot equilibrium is then Q
1 = Q2 = 10, so that P = 10 and each firm earns a profit of 100. Recall 
also that if the two firms colluded, they would set Q1 = Q2 = 7.5, so that P = 15 
and each firm earns a profit of 112.50. Finally, recall from Section 12.3 that in the Stackelberg model, in which Firm 1 moves first, the outcome is Q
1 = 15 and 
Q2 = 7.5, so that P = 7.50 and the firms’ profits are 112.50 and 56.25, respectively.
These and a few other possible outcomes are summarized in the payoff 
matrix in Table 13.10. If both firms move simultaneously, the only solution to the game is that both produce 10 and earn 100. In this Cournot equilibrium each firm is doing the best it can given what its competitor is doing. If Firm 1 moves first, however, it knows that its decision will constrain Firm 2’s choice. Observe from the payoff matrix that if Firm 1 sets Q
1 = 7.5, Firm 2’s best response will be In §12.2, we explain that the 
Stackelberg model is an oli-gopoly model in which one firm sets its output before other firms do.
Recall that in §12.2, we explain that in the Cournot model each firm treats the output of its competitors as fixed, and that all firms simultaneously decide how much to produce.Firm 1Firm 2

to set Q2 = 10. This will give Firm 1 a profit of 93.75 and Firm 2 a profit of 125. If 
Firm 1 sets Q1 = 10, Firm 2 will set Q2 = 10, and both firms will earn 100. But if 
Firm 1 sets Q1 = 15, Firm 2 will set Q2 = 7.5, so that Firm 1 earns 112.50, and Firm 
2 earns 56.25. Therefore, the most that Firm 1 can earn is 112.50, and it does so by setting Q
1 = 15. Compared to the Cournot outcome, when Firm 1 moves first, it 
does better—and Firm 2 does much worse.
13.6   Threats, Commitments, and 
Credibility
The product choice problem and the Stackelberg model are two examples of 
how a firm that moves first can create a fait accompli  that gives it an advantage 
over its competitor. In this section, we’ll take a broader look at the advantage that a firm can have by moving first. We’ll also consider what determines which  
firm goes first. We will focus on the following question: What actions can a firm 
take to gain advantage in the marketplace?  For example, how might a firm deter 
entry by potential competitors, or induce existing competitors to raise prices, reduce output, or leave the market altogether?
Recall that in the Stackelberg model, the firm that moved first gained an 
advantage by committing itself to a large output.  Making a commitment— 
constraining its future behavior—is crucial. To see why, suppose that the first mover (Firm 1) could later change its mind in response to what Firm 2 does. What would happen? Clearly, Firm 2 would produce a large output. Why? Because it knows that Firm 1 will respond by reducing the output that it first announced. The only way that Firm 1 can gain a first-mover advantage is by committing itself. In effect, Firm 1 constrains Firm 2’s behavior by constraining its 
own behavior.
The idea of constraining your own behavior to gain an advantage may seem 
paradoxical, but we’ll soon see that it is not. Let’s consider a few examples.
First, let’s return once more to the product-choice problem shown in  
Table 13.9. The firm that introduces its new breakfast cereal first will do best. But which firm will introduce its cereal first ? Even if both firms require the same 
amount of time to gear up production, each has an incentive to commit itself first 
to the sweet cereal.  The key word is commit.  If Firm 1 simply announces it will 
produce the sweet cereal, Firm 2 will have little reason to believe it. After all, Firm 2, knowing the incentives, can make the same announcement louder and more vociferously. Firm 1 must constrain its own behavior in some way that convinces Firm 2 that Firm 1 has no choice  but to produce the sweet cereal. Firm 
1 might launch an expensive advertising campaign describing the new sweet cereal well before its introduction, thereby putting its reputation on the line. Firm 1 might also sign a contract for the forward delivery of a large quantity of sugar (and make the contract public, or at least send a copy to Firm 2). The idea is for Firm 1 to commit itself  to produce the sweet cereal. Commitment is a 
strategic move that will induce Firm 2 to make the decision that Firm 1 wants it to make—namely, to produce the crispy cereal.
Why can’t Firm 1 simply threaten  Firm 2, vowing to produce the sweet cereal 
even if Firm 2 does the same? Because Firm 2 has little reason to believe the threat—and can make the same threat itself. A threat is useful only if it is cred-ible. The following example should help make this clear.506  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
Empty Threats
Suppose Firm 1 produces personal computers that can be used both as word 
processors and to do other tasks. Firm 2 produces only dedicated word proces-sors. As the payoff matrix in Table 13.11 shows, as long as Firm 1 charges a high price for its computers, both firms can make a good deal of money. Even if Firm 2 charges a low price for its word processors, many people will still buy Firm 1’s computers (because they can do so many other things), although some buyers will be induced by the price differential to buy the dedicated word processor instead. However, if Firm 1 charges a low price, Firm 2 will also have to charge a low price (or else make zero profit), and the profit of both firms will be signifi-cantly reduced.
Firm 1 would prefer the outcome in the upper left-hand corner of the matrix. 
For Firm 2, however, charging a low price is clearly a dominant strategy. Thus the outcome in the upper right-hand corner will prevail (no matter which firm sets its price first).
Firm 1 would probably be viewed as the “dominant” firm in this industry 
because its pricing actions will have the greatest impact on overall industry profits. Can Firm 1 induce Firm 2 to charge a high price by threatening  to charge 
a low price if Firm 2 charges a low price? No, as the payoff matrix in Table 13.11 makes clear: Whatever  Firm 2 does, Firm 1 will be much worse off if it charges a 
low price. As a result, its threat is not credible.
Commitment and Credibility
Sometimes firms can make threats credible. To see how, consider the following example. Race Car Motors, Inc., produces cars, and Far Out Engines, Ltd., pro-duces specialty car engines. Far Out Engines sells most of its engines to Race Car Motors, and a few to a limited outside market. Nonetheless, it depends heavily on Race Car Motors and makes its production decisions in response to Race Car’s production plans.
We thus have a sequential game in which Race Car is the “leader.” It will 
decide what kind of cars to build, and Far Out Engines will then decide what kind of engines to produce. The payoff matrix in Table 13.12(a) shows the possi-ble outcomes of this game. (Profits are in millions of dollars.) Observe that Race Car will do best by deciding to produce small cars. It knows that in response to this decision, Far Out will produce small engines, most of which Race Car will then buy. As a result, Far Out will make $3 million and Race Car $6 million.
Far Out, however, would much prefer the outcome in the lower right-hand 
corner of the payoff matrix. If it could produce big engines, and if Race Car pro-
duced big cars and thus bought the big engines, it would make $8 million. (Race Car, however, would make only $3 million.) Can Far Out induce Race Car to produce big cars instead of small ones?TABLE 13.11  PRICING OF COMPUTERS AND WORD 
PROCESSORS

High price Low price
Firm 1High price 100, 80 80, 100
Low price 20, 0 10, 20CHAPTER 13   •  Game Theory and Competitive Strategy  507
Suppose Far Out threatens  to produce big engines no matter what Race Car 
does; suppose, too, that no other engine producer can easily satisfy the needs of Race Car. If Race Car believed Far Out’s threat, it would produce big cars: Otherwise, it would have trouble finding engines for its small cars and would earn only $1 million instead of $3 million. But the threat is not credible: Once Race Car responded by announcing its intentions to produce small cars, Far Out would have no incentive to carry out its threat.
Far Out can make its threat credible by visibly and irreversibly reducing 
some of its own payoffs in the matrix, thereby constraining its own choices. In particular, Far Out must reduce its profits from small engines (the payoffs in the top row of the matrix). It might do this by shutting down or destroying some of its 
small engine production capacity.  This would result in the payoff matrix shown in 
Table 13.12(b). Now Race Car knows  that whatever kind of car it produces, Far 
Out will produce big engines. If Race Car produces the small cars, Far Out will sell the big engines as best it can to other car producers and settle for making only $1 million. But this is better than making no profits by producing small engines. Because Race Car will have to look elsewhere for engines, its profit will also be lower ($1 million). Now it is clearly in Race Car’s interest to produce large cars. By taking an action that seemingly puts itself at a disadvantage , Far Out 
has improved its outcome in the game.
Although strategic commitments of this kind can be effective, they are risky 
and depend heavily on having accurate knowledge of the payoff matrix and the industry. Suppose, for example, that Far Out commits itself to producing big engines but is surprised to find that another firm can produce small engines at a low cost. The commitment may then lead Far Out to bankruptcy rather than continued high profits.
THE ROLE OF REPUTATION  Developing the right kind of reputation  can also 
give one a strategic advantage. Again, consider Far Out Engines’ desire to pro-duce big engines for Race Car Motors’ big cars. Suppose that the managers of Far Out Engines develop a reputation for being irrational—perhaps downright crazy. They threaten to produce big engines no matter what Race Car Motors TABLE 13.12(a) PRODUCTION CHOICE PROBLEM

does (refer to Table 13.12a). Now the threat might be credible without any fur-
ther action; after all, you can’t be sure that an irrational manager will always make a profit-maximizing decision. In gaming situations, the party that is known (or thought) to be a little crazy can have a significant advantage.
Developing a reputation can be an especially important strategy in a repeated 
game. A firm might find it advantageous to behave irrationally for several plays of the game. This might give it a reputation that will allow it to increase its long-run profits substantially.
Bargaining Strategy
Our discussion of commitment and credibility also applies to bargaining prob-lems. The outcome of a bargaining situation can depend on the ability of either side to take an action that alters its relative bargaining position.
For example, consider two firms that are each planning to introduce one 
of two products which are complementary goods. As the payoff matrix in  Table 13.13 shows, Firm 1 has a cost advantage over Firm 2 in producing A. 
Therefore, if both firms produce A, Firm 1 can maintain a lower price and earn 
a higher profit. Similarly, Firm 2 has a cost advantage over Firm 1 in producing product B. If the two firms could agree about who will produce what, the ratio-
nal outcome would be the one in the upper right-hand corner: Firm 1 produces A, Firm 2 produces B, and both firms make profits of 50. Indeed, even without 
cooperation , this outcome will result whether Firm 1 or Firm 2 moves first or both 
firms move simultaneously. Why? Because producing B is a dominant strategy 
for Firm 2, so ( A, B) is the only Nash equilibrium.
Firm 1, of course, would prefer the outcome in the lower left-hand corner of 
the payoff matrix. But in the context of this limited set of decisions, it cannot achieve that outcome. Suppose, however, that Firms 1 and 2 are also bargaining over a second issue—whether to join a research consortium that a third firm is trying to form. Table 13.14 shows the payoff matrix for this decision problem. Clearly, the dominant strategy is for both firms to enter the consortium, thereby increasing profits to 40.
Now suppose that Firm 1 links the two bargaining problems  by announcing that it 
will join the consortium only if Firm 2 agrees to produce product A. In this case, it 
is indeed in Firm 2’s interest to produce A (with Firm 1 producing B) in return for 
Firm 1’s participation in the consortium. This example illustrates how combining issues in a bargaining agenda can sometimes benefit one side at the other’s expense.
As another example, consider bargaining over the price of a house. Suppose 
I, as a potential buyer, do not want to pay more than $200,000 for a house that is actually worth $250,000 to me. The seller is willing to part with the house at any price above $180,000 but would like to receive the highest price she can. If I am the only bidder for the house, how can I make the seller think that I will walk away rather than pay more than $200,000?

Produce A Produce B
Firm 1Produce A 40, 5 50, 50
Produce B 60, 40 5, 45CHAPTER 13   •  Game Theory and Competitive Strategy  509
I might declare that I will never, ever pay more than $200,000 for the house. 
But is such a promise credible? It may be if the seller knows that I have a repu-tation for toughness and that I have never reneged on a promise of this sort. But suppose I have no such reputation. Then the seller knows that I have every incentive to make the promise (making it costs nothing) but little incentive to keep it. (This will probably be our only business transaction together.) As a result, this promise by itself is not likely to improve my bargaining position.
The promise can work, however, if it is combined with an action that gives 
it credibility. Such an action must reduce my flexibility—limit my options—so that I have no choice but to keep the promise. One possibility would be to make an enforceable bet with a third party—for example, “If I pay more than $200,000 for that house, I’ll pay you $60,000.” Alternatively, if I am buying the house on behalf of my company, the company might insist on authorization by the Board of Directors for a price above $200,000, and announce that the board will not meet again for several months. In both cases, my promise becomes credible because I have destroyed my ability to break it. The result is less flexibility—and more bargaining power.TABLE 13.14 DECISION TO JOIN CONSORTIUM

EXAMPLE 13.4   WAL-MART STORES’ PREEMPTIVE INVESTMENT STRATEGY
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., is an enor-
mously successful chain of dis-count retail stores started by Sam Walton in 1969.
12 Its success was 
unusual in the industry. During the 1960s and 1970s, rapid expansion by existing firms and the entry and expansion of new firms made dis-count retailing increasingly com-petitive. During the 1970s and 1980s, industry-wide profits fell, and large discount chains—including such giants as King’s, Korvette’s, Mammoth Mart, W. T. Grant, and Woolco—went bankrupt. Wal-Mart Stores, however, kept on growing and became even more profitable. By the end of 1985, Sam Walton was one of the richest people in 
the United States.
How did Wal-Mart Stores suc-
ceed where others failed? The key was Wal-Mart’s expansion strat-egy. To charge less than ordinary department stores and small retail stores, discount stores rely on size, no frills, and high inventory 
turnover. Through the 1960s, the conventional wis-dom held that a discount store could succeed only in a city with a population of 100,000 or more. Sam Walton disagreed and decided to open his stores in small Southwestern towns; by 1970, there were 30 Wal-Mart stores in small towns in Arkansas, Missouri, 
12This example is based in part on information in Pankaj Ghemawat, “Wal-Mart Stores’ Discount 
Operations,” Harvard Business School, 1986.510  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
13.7  Entry Deterrence
Barriers to entry, which are an important source of monopoly power and profits, 
sometimes arise naturally. For example, economies of scale, patents and licenses, or access to critical inputs can create entry barriers. However, firms themselves can sometimes deter entry by potential competitors.
To deter entry, the incumbent firm must convince any potential competitor that 
entry will be unprofitable.  To see how this might be done, put yourself in the posi-
tion of an incumbent monopolist facing a prospective entrant, Firm X. Suppose 
that to enter the industry, Firm X will have to pay a (sunk) cost of $80 million 
to build a plant. You, of course, would like to induce Firm X to stay out of the and Oklahoma. The stores succeeded because Wal-
Mart had created 30 “local monopolies.” Discount stores that had opened in larger towns and cities were competing with other discount stores, which drove down prices and profit margins. These small towns, however, had room for only one discount operation. Wal-Mart could undercut the nondis-count retailers and never had to worry that another discount store would open and compete with it.
By the mid-1970s, other discount chains real-
ized that Wal-Mart had a profitable strategy: Open a store in a small town that could support only one discount store and enjoy a local monopoly. There are a lot of small towns in the United States, so the issue became who would get to each town first. Wal-Mart now found itself in a preemption game  of the sort 
illustrated by the payoff matrix in Table 13.15. As the matrix shows, if Wal-Mart enters a town but Company X does not, Wal-Mart will make 20 and Company X 
will make 0. Similarly, if Wal-Mart doesn’t enter but Company X does, Wal-Mart makes 0 and Company 
X makes 20. But if Wal-Mart and Company X both  
enter, they both lose 10.
This game has two Nash equilibria—the lower 
left-hand corner and the upper right-hand corner. Which equilibrium results depends on who moves first. If Wal-Mart moves first, it can enter, knowing 
that the rational response of Company X will be not 
to enter, so that Wal-Mart will be assured of earn-ing 20. The trick, therefore, is to preempt —to set up 
stores in other small towns quickly, before Company X (or Company Y or Z) can do so. That is exactly 
what Wal-Mart did. By 1986, it had 1009 stores in operation and was earning an annual profit of $450 million. And while other discount chains were going under, Wal-Mart continued to grow. By 1999, Wal-Mart had become the world’s largest retailer, with 2454 stores in the United States and another 729 stores in the rest of the world, and had annual sales of $138 billion.
In recent years, Wal-Mart has continued to pre-
empt other retailers by opening new discount stores, warehouse stores (such as Sam’s Club), and combination discount and grocery stores (Wal-Mart Supercenters) all over the world. Wal-Mart has been especially aggressive in applying its preemp-tion strategy in other countries. As of 2010, Wal-Mart had about 4413 stores in the United States and about 4557 stores throughout Europe, Latin America, and Asia. Wal-Mart had also become the world’s largest private employer, with more than 2.1 million employees worldwide.

industry. If X stays out, you can continue to charge a high price and enjoy 
monopoly profits. As shown in the upper right-hand corner of the payoff matrix in Table 13.16(a), you would earn $200 million in profits.
If Firm X does enter the market, you must make a decision. You can be 
“accommodating,” maintaining a high price in the hope that X will do the 
same. In that case, you will earn only $100 million in profit because you will have to share the market. New entrant X will earn a net profit of $20 million: 
$100 million minus the $80 million cost of constructing a plant. (This outcome is shown in the upper left-hand corner of the payoff matrix.) Alternatively, you can increase your production capacity, produce more, and lower your price. The lower price will give you a greater market share and a $20 million increase in revenues. Increasing production capacity, however, will cost $50 million, reduc-ing your net profit to $70 million. Because warfare will also reduce the entrant’s revenue by $30 million, it will have a net loss of $10 million. (This outcome is shown in the lower left-hand corner of the payoff matrix.) Finally, if Firm X 
stays out but you expand capacity and lower price nonetheless, your net profit will fall by $70 million (from $200 million to $130 million): the $50 million cost of the extra capacity and a $20 million reduction in revenue from the lower price with no gain in market share. Clearly this choice, shown in the lower right-hand corner of the matrix, would make no sense.
If Firm X thinks you will be accommodating and maintain a high price after 
it has entered, it will find it profitable to enter and will do so. Suppose you threaten to expand output and wage a price war in order to keep X out. If X 
takes the threat seriously, it will not enter the market because it can expect to lose $10 million. The threat, however, is not credible. As Table 13.16(a) shows (and as the potential competitor knows), once entry has occurred, it will be in your 
best interest to accommodate and maintain a high price.  Firm X’s rational move is to 
enter the market; the outcome will be the upper left-hand corner of the matrix.
But what if you can make an irrevocable commitment that will alter your 
incentives once entry occurs—a commitment that will give you little choice but to charge a low price if entry occurs? In particular, suppose you invest the $50 million now, rather than later, in the extra capacity needed to increase output and 
engage in competitive warfare should entry occur. Of course, if you later maintain a high price (whether or not X enters), this added cost will reduce your payoff.
We now have a new payoff matrix, as shown in Table 13.16(b). As a result 
of your decision to invest in additional capacity, your threat to engage in com-petitive warfare is completely credible.  Because you already have the additional 
capacity with which to wage war, you will do better in competitive warfare than you would by maintaining a high price. Because the potential competitor now knows that entry will result in warfare, it is rational for it to stay out of the mar-ket. Meanwhile, having deterred entry, you can maintain a high price and earn a profit of $150 million.In §7.1, we explain that a 
sunk cost is an expenditure that has been made and cannot be recovered.TABLE 13.16(a) ENTRY POSSIBILITIES

Can an incumbent monopolist deter entry without making the costly move 
of installing additional production capacity? Earlier we saw that a reputation for irrationality can bestow a strategic advantage. Suppose the incumbent firm has such a reputation. Suppose also that by means of vicious price-cutting, this firm has eventually driven out every entrant in the past, even though it incurred losses in doing so. Its threat might then be credible: The incumbent’s irrational-ity suggests to the potential competitor that it might be better off staying away.
Of course, if the game described above were to be indefinitely repeated , then 
the incumbent might have a rational  incentive to engage in warfare whenever 
entry actually occurs. Why? Because short-term losses from warfare might be outweighed by longer-term gains from preventing entry. Understanding this, the potential competitor might find the incumbent’s threat of warfare credible and decide to stay out. Now the incumbent relies on its reputation for being rational—and far-sighted—to provide the credibility needed to deter entry. The success of this strategy depends on the time horizon and the relative gains and losses associated with accommodation and warfare.
We have seen that the attractiveness of entry depends largely on the way 
incumbents can be expected to react. In general, once entry has occurred, incum-bents cannot be expected to maintain output at their pre-entry levels. Eventually, they may back off and reduce output, raising price to a new joint profit- maximizing level. Because potential entrants know this, incumbent firms must create a credible threat of warfare to deter entry. A reputation for irrationality can help. Indeed, this seems to be the basis for much of the entry-preventing behavior that goes on in actual markets. The potential entrant must consider that rational  industry discipline can break down after entry occurs. By fostering 
an image of irrationality and belligerence, an incumbent firm might convince potential entrants that the risk of warfare is too high.

Strategic Trade Policy and International Competition
We have seen how a preemptive investment can give a firm an advantage by creating a credible threat to potential competitors. In some situations, a preemp-tive investment—subsidized or otherwise encouraged by the government—can TABLE 13.16(b) ENTRY DETERRENCE

13There is an analogy here to nuclear deterrence.  Consider the use of a nuclear threat to deter the 
former Soviet Union from invading Western Europe during the Cold War. If it invaded, would the United States actually react with nuclear weapons, knowing that the Soviets would then respond in kind? Because it is not rational for the United States to react this way, a nuclear threat might not seem credible. But this assumes that everyone is rational; there is a reason to fear an irrational  
response by the United States. Even if an irrational response is viewed as very improbable, it can be a deterrent, given the costliness of an error. The United States can thus gain by promoting the idea that it might act irrationally, or that events might get out of control once an invasion occurs. This is the “rationality of irrationality.” See Thomas Schelling, The Strategy of Conflict  (Harvard Univ. 
Press, 1980).CHAPTER 13   •  Game Theory and Competitive Strategy  513
give a country  an advantage in international markets and so be an important 
instrument of trade policy.
Does this conflict with what you have learned about the benefits of free 
trade? In Chapter 9, for example, we saw how trade restrictions such as tariffs or quotas lead to deadweight losses. In Chapter 16 we go further and show how, in a general way, free trade between people (or between countries) is mutually beneficial. Given the virtues of free trade, how can government intervention in an international market ever be warranted? In certain situations, a country can benefit by adopting policies that give its domestic industries a competitive advantage.
To see how this might occur, consider an industry with substantial economies 
of scale—one in which a few large firms can produce much more efficiently than many small ones. Suppose that by granting subsidies or tax breaks, the govern-ment can encourage domestic firms to expand faster than they would otherwise. This might prevent firms in other countries from entering the world market, so that the domestic industry can enjoy higher prices and greater sales. Such a policy works by creating a credible threat to potential entrants. Large domes-tic firms, taking advantage of scale economies, would be able to satisfy world demand at a low price; if other firms entered, price would be driven below the point at which they could make a profit.
THE COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT MARKET  As an example, consider the inter-
national market for commercial aircraft. The development and production of a new line of aircraft are subject to substantial economies of scale; it would not pay to develop a new aircraft unless a firm expected to sell many of them. Suppose that Boeing and Airbus (a European consortium that includes France, Germany, Britain, and Spain) are each considering developing a new aircraft. The ultimate payoff to each firm depends in part on what the other firm does. Suppose it is only economical for one firm to produce the new aircraft. Then the payoffs might look like those in Table 13.17(a).

If Boeing has a head start in the development process, the outcome of the 
game is the upper right-hand corner of the payoff matrix. Boeing will produce a new aircraft, and Airbus, realizing that it will lose money if it does the same, will not. Boeing will then earn a profit of 100.
European governments, of course, would prefer that Airbus produce the new 
aircraft. Can they change the outcome of this game? Suppose they commit to subsidizing Airbus and make this commitment before Boeing has committed itself to produce. If the European governments commit to a subsidy of 20 to Airbus if it produces the plane regardless of what Boeing does , the payoff matrix 
would change to the one in Table 13.17(b).

Now Airbus will make money from a new aircraft whether or not Boeing 
produces one. Boeing knows that even if it commits to producing, Airbus will produce as well, and Boeing will lose money. Thus Boeing will decide not to produce, and the outcome will be the one in the lower left-hand corner of Table 13.17(b). A subsidy of 20, then, changes the outcome from one in which Airbus does not produce and earns 0, to one in which it does produce and earns 120. Of this, 100 is a transfer of profit from the United States to Europe. From the European point of view, subsidizing Airbus yields a high return.
European governments did commit to subsidizing Airbus, and during the 
1980s, Airbus successfully introduced several new airplanes. The result, how-ever, was not quite the one reflected in our simplified example. Boeing also introduced new airplanes (the 757 and 767 models) that were quite profitable. As commercial air travel grew, it became clear that both companies could profit-ably develop and sell new airplanes. Nonetheless, Boeing’s market share would have been much larger without the European subsidies to Airbus. One study estimated that those subsidies totalled $25.9 billion during the 1980s and found that Airbus would not have entered the market without them.

This example shows how strategic trade policy can transfer profits from one 
country to another. Bear in mind, however, that a country that uses such a pol-icy may provoke retaliation from its trading partners. If a trade war results, all countries can end up much worse off. The possibility of such an outcome must be considered before a nation adopts a strategic trade policy.TABLE 13.17(b)  DEVELOPMENT OF AIRCRAFT AFTER

INDUSTRY
Titanium dioxide is a whitener used in paints, paper, 
and other products. In the early 1970s, DuPont and National Lead each accounted for about a third of U.S. titanium dioxide sales; another seven firms pro-duced the remainder. In 1972, DuPont was consid-ering whether to expand capacity. The industry was changing, and with the right strategy, those changes 
might enable DuPont to capture more of the market and dominate the industry.
16
Three factors had to be considered. First, 
although future demand for titanium dioxide was uncertain, it was expected to grow substantially. CHAPTER 13   •  Game Theory and Competitive Strategy  515
Second, the government had announced that new 
environmental regulations would be imposed. Third, the prices of raw materials used to make titanium dioxide were rising. The new regulations and the higher input prices would have a major effect on production cost and give DuPont a cost  advantage, both because its production technology 
was less sensitive to the change in input prices and because its plants were in areas that made disposal of corrosive wastes much less difficult than for other producers. Because of these cost changes, DuPont anticipated that National Lead and some other pro-ducers would have to shut down part of their capac-ity. DuPont’s competitors would in effect have to “reenter” the market by building new plants. Could DuPont deter them from taking this step?
DuPont considered the following strategy: invest 
nearly $400 million in increased production capac-ity to try to capture 64 percent of the market by 1985. The production capacity that would be put on line would be much more than what was actu-
ally needed. The idea was to deter competitors 
from investing.  Scale economies and movement 
down the learning curve would give DuPont a cost advantage. This would not only make it hard for other firms to compete, but would make credible the implicit threat that in the future, DuPont would fight rather than accommodate.
The strategy was sensible and seemed to work 
for a few years. By 1975, however, things began to go awry. First, because demand grew by much less than expected, there was excess capacity industrywide. Second, because the environmental regulations were only weakly enforced, competitors did not have to shut down capacity as expected. Finally, DuPont’s strategy led to antitrust action by the Federal Trade Commission in 1978. The FTC claimed that DuPont was attempting to monopolize the market. DuPont won the case, but the decline in demand made its victory moot.
17Procter & Gamble makes Pampers, Ultra Pampers, and Luvs. Kimberly-Clark has only one major 
brand, Huggies.EXAMPLE 13.6  DIAPER WARS
For more than two decades, the 
disposable diaper industry in the United States has been domi-nated by two firms: Procter & Gamble, with an approximately 50-percent market share, and Kimberly-Clark, with another 30–40 percent.
17 How do these 
firms compete? And why haven’t other firms been able to enter and take a significant share of this $5-billion-per-year market?
Even though there are only two major firms, com-
petition is intense. The competition occurs mostly in the form of cost-reducing innovation.  The key to 
success is to perfect the manufacturing process so that a plant can manufacture diapers in high volume and at low cost. This is not as simple as it might seem. Packing cellulose fluff for absorbency, add-ing an elastic gatherer, and binding, folding, and packaging the diapers—at a rate 
of about 3000 diapers per minute and at a cost of about 10 cents per diaper—requires an innova-tive, carefully designed, and finely tuned process. Furthermore, small technological improvements in the manufacturing process can 
result in a significant competitive advantage. If a firm can shave its production cost even slightly, it can reduce price and capture market share. As a result, both firms are forced to spend heavily on research and development (R&D) in a race to reduce cost.
The payoff matrix in Table 13.18 illustrates this. 
If both firms spend aggressively on R&D, they can expect to maintain their current market shares. P&G will earn a profit of 40, and Kimberly-Clark (with a smaller market share) will earn 20. If neither firm spends money on R&D, their costs and prices will

*13.8  Auctions
In this section, we examine auction markets —markets in which products are 
bought and sold through formal bidding processes.19 Auctions come in all sizes 
and shapes. They are often used for differentiated products, especially unique items such as art, antiques, and the rights to extract oil from a piece of land. In recent years, for example, the U.S. Treasury has relied on auctions to sell Treasury bills, the Federal Communications Commission has used auctions for the sale of portions of the electromagnetic spectrum for cellular telephone services, the International Olympic Committee has auctioned television rights, and the Department of Defense has used auctions to procure military equip-ment. Auctions like these have important advantages: They are likely to be less time-consuming than one-on-one bargaining, and they encourage competition among buyers in a way that increases the seller’s revenue.
Why have auctions become so popular and so successful? The low cost of 
transacting is only part of the answer. Unlike sales in retail stores, auctions are • auction market  Market in 
which products are bought and sold through formal bidding processes.remain constant and the money saved will become 
part of profits. P&G’s profit will increase to 60 and Kimberly-Clark’s to 40. However, if one firm contin-
ues to do R&D and the other doesn’t, the innovating firm will eventually capture most of its competitor’s market share. For example, if Kimberly-Clark does R&D and P&G does not, P&G can expect to lose 20 while Kimberly-Clark’s profit increases to 60. The two firms are therefore in a prisoners’ dilemma: Spending money on R&D is a dominant strategy for each firm.
Why hasn’t cooperative behavior evolved? After 
all, the two firms have been competing in this mar-ket for years, and the demand for diapers is fairly stable. For several reasons, a prisoners’ dilemma involving R&D is particularly hard to resolve. First, it is difficult for a firm to monitor its competitor’s R&D activities the way it can monitor price. Second, it can 
take several years to complete an R&D program that leads to a major product improvement. As a result, tit-for-tat strategies, in which both firms cooperate until one of them “cheats,” are less likely to work. A firm may not find out that its competitor has been secretly doing R&D until the competitor announces a new and improved product. By then it may be too late to gear up an R&D program of its own.
The ongoing R&D expenditures by P&G and 
Kimberly-Clark also serve to deter entry. In addi-tion to brand name recognition, these two firms have accumulated so much technological know-how and manufacturing proficiency that they would have a considerable cost advantage over any firm just entering the market. Besides building new fac-tories, an entrant would have to make a large invest-ment in R&D to capture even a small share of the market. After it began producing, a new firm would have to continue to spend heavily on R&D to reduce its costs over time. Entry would be profitable only if P&G and Kimberly-Clark stop doing R&D, so that the entrant could catch up and eventually gain a cost advantage. But as we have seen, no rational firm would expect this to happen.

19There is a vast literature on auctions; for example, see Paul Milgrom, “Auctions and Bidding: A 
Primer,” Journal of Economic Perspectives  (Summer 1989): 3–22; Avinash Dixit and Susan Skeath, 
Games of Strategy,  2nd ed. (New York: Norton, 2004); and Preston McAfee, Competitive Solutions: The 
Strategist’s Toolkit , Princeton University Press (2002): ch. 12.CHAPTER 13   •  Game Theory and Competitive Strategy  517
inherently interactive, with many buyers competing to obtain an item of inter-
est. This interaction can be particularly valuable for the sale of items such as artwork or sports memorabilia that are unique, and therefore do not have estab-lished market values. It can also be helpful for the sale of items that are not unique but whose value fluctuates over time.
An example is the daily auctioning of fresh tuna at a Tokyo fish market.
20 
Each tuna is unique in size, shape, and quality, and consequently in value. If each transaction were carried out through rounds of bargaining and negotiation with potential buyers, it would be extremely time-consuming. Instead, sales occur every morning by means of an auction in which each tuna is sold to the highest bidder. This format creates large savings in transaction costs and thereby increases the efficiency of the market.
The design of an auction, which involves choosing the rules under which it 
operates, greatly affects its outcome. A seller will usually want an auction for-mat that maximizes the revenue from the sale of the product. On the other hand, a buyer collecting bids from a group of potential sellers will want an auction that minimizes the expected cost of the product.
Auction Formats
We will see that the choice of auction format can affect the seller’s auction rev-enue. Several different kinds of auction formats are widely used:
 1. English  (or oral) auction:  The seller actively solicits progressively higher 
bids from a group of potential buyers. At each point, all participants are aware of the current high bid. The auction stops when no bidder is willing to surpass the current high bid; the item is then sold to the highest bidder at a price equal to the amount of the high bid.
 2. Dutch auction  The seller begins by offering the item at a relatively high 
price. If no potential buyer agrees to that price, the seller reduces the price by fixed amounts. The first buyer who accepts an offered price can buy the item at that price.
 3. Sealed-bid auction  All bids are made simultaneously in sealed envelopes, 
and the winning bidder is the individual who has submitted the highest bid. The price paid by the winning bidder will vary, however, depending on the rules of the auction. In a first-price auction , the sales price is equal 
to the highest bid. In a second-price auction , the sales price is equal to the 
second-highest bid.
Valuation and Information
Suppose you want to sell a distinctive and valuable product such as a painting or a rare coin. Which type of auction is best for you? The answer depends on the preferences of the bidders and the information available to them. We consider two cases:
 1. In private-value auctions  each bidder knows his or her individual valu-
ation or reservation price , and valuations differ from bidder to bidder. In 
addition, each bidder is uncertain about the value that other bidders place on the product. For example, I might value a signed Barry Bonds home run baseball very highly but not know that you value it less highly.• English (or oral) 
auction  Auction in which

• second-price auction

Recall from §11.2 that the reservation price is the maxi-mum amount of money that an individual will pay for a product.
20John McMillan, Reinventing the Bazaar: A Natural History of Markets  (New York, Norton, 2002).518  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
 2. In common-value auctions , the item to be auctioned has approximately 
the same value to all bidders. Bidders, however, do not know precisely what that value is—they can only estimate it, and bidders’ estimates will vary. For example, in an auction of an offshore oil reserve, the value of the reserve is the price of oil minus the extraction cost, times the amount of oil in the reserve. As a result, the value should be about the same for all bid-ders. However, bidders will not know the amount of oil or the extraction cost—they can only estimate these numbers. Because their estimates will differ, they might bid very different amounts to get the reserve.
In reality, auctions can have both private-value and common-value ele-
ments. In the oil reserve auction, for example, there may be some private-value elements because different oil reserves may entail different extraction costs. However, to simplify matters we will separate the two. We begin our discussion with private-value auctions and then move on to common-value auctions.
Private-Value Auctions
In private-value auctions, bidders have different reservation prices for the offered item. We might suppose, for example, that in an auction for a signed Barry Bonds baseball, individuals’ reservation prices range from $1 (someone who doesn’t like baseball but is bidding just for fun) to $600 (a San Francisco Giants fan). Of course, if you are bidding for the baseball, you don’t know how many people will bid against you or what their bids will be.
Whatever the auction format, each bidder must choose his or her bidding 
strategy. For an open English auction, this strategy is a choice of a price at which to stop bidding. For a Dutch auction, the strategy is the price at which the indi-vidual expects to make his or her only bid. For a sealed-bid auction, the strategy is the choice of bid to place in a sealed envelope.
What are the payoffs in this bidding game? The payoff for winning is the dif-
ference between the winner’s reservation price and the price paid; the payoff for losing is zero. Given these payoffs, let’s examine bidding strategies and out-comes for different auction formats.
We will begin by showing that English oral auctions and second-price 
sealed-bid auctions generate nearly identical outcomes. Let’s begin with the second-price sealed-bid auction. In this auction, bidding truthfully is a dominant 
 strategy —there is no advantage to bidding below your reservation price. Why? 
Because the price you pay is based on the valuation of the second highest bid-
der, not on your own valuation. Suppose that your reservation price is $100. If 
you bid below your reservation price—say, $80—you risk losing to the second-highest bidder, who bids $85, when winning (at, say, $87) would have given you a positive payoff. If you bid above your reservation price—say $105—you risk winning but receiving a negative payoff.
Similarly, in an English auction the dominant strategy is to continue bidding 
until the second person is unwilling to make a bid. Then the winning bid will be approximately equal to the reservation price of the second person. In any case, you should stop bidding when the bidding reaches your reservation price.  Why? 
Because if you stop bidding at a point below your reservation price, you risk losing a positive payoff; if you continue beyond your reservation price, you will be guaranteed a negative payoff. How high will the bidding go? It will con-tinue until the winning bid is approximately equal to the reservation price of the second-highest bidder. Likewise, in the sealed-bid auction the winning bid will equal the reservation price of the second-highest bidder. Thus, both  auction • common-value auction
Auction in which the item has 
the same value to all bidders, but bidders do not know that value precisely and their estimates of it vary.CHAPTER 13   •  Game Theory and Competitive Strategy  519
formats generate nearly identical outcomes. (The outcomes should differ in the-
ory only by a dollar or two.) To illustrate, suppose that there are three bidders whose valuations are $50, $40, and $30, respectively, and furthermore the auc-tioneer and the bidders have complete information about these valuations. In an English auction, if your valuation was $50 you would offer a winning bid of $40.01 in order to win the bidding from the individual whose reservation price was $40.00. You would make the identical bid in a sealed-bid auction.
Even in a world of incomplete information, we would expect similar 
results. Indeed, you know that as a seller, you should be indifferent between an oral English auction and a second-price sealed-bid auction, because bid-ders in each case have private values. Suppose that you plan to sell an item using a sealed-bid auction. Which should you choose, a first-price or a second-price auction? You might think that the first-price auction is better because the payment is given by the highest rather than the second-highest bid. Bidders, however, are aware of this reasoning and will alter their bidding strategies accordingly: They will bid less in anticipation of paying the winning bid if they are successful.
The second-price sealed-bid auction generates revenue equal to the second-
highest reservation price. However, the revenue implications of a first-price sealed-bid auction for the seller are more complicated because the optimal strat-egy of bidders is more complex. The best strategy is to choose a bid that you believe will be equal to or slightly above the reservation price of the individual with the second-highest reservation price.
21 Why? Because the winner must pay 
his or her bid, and it is never worth paying more than the second-highest reser-vation price. Thus, we see that the first-price and second-price sealed-bid auc-tions generate the same expected revenue.
Common-Value Auctions
Suppose that you and four other people participate in an oral auction to pur-chase a large jar of pennies, which will go to the winning bidder at a price equal to the highest bid. Each bidder can examine the jar but cannot open it and count the pennies. Once you have estimated the number of pennies in the jar, what is your optimal bidding strategy? This is a classic common-value auction, because the jar of pennies has the same value for all bidders. The problem for you and other bidders is the fact that the value is unknown.
You might be tempted to do what many novices would do in this situation—
bid up to your own estimate of the number of pennies in the jar, and no higher. This, however, is not the best way to bid. Remember that neither you nor the other bidders knows the number of pennies for certain. All of you have inde-pendently made estimates of the number, and those estimates are subject to error—some will be too high and some too low. Who, then, will be the winning bidder? If each bidder bids up to his or her estimate, the winning bidder is likely to 
be the person with the largest positive error —i.e., the person with the largest overes-
timate of the number of pennies.
THE WINNER’S CURSE  To appreciate this possibility, suppose that there are 
actually 620 pennies in the jar. Let’s say the bidders’ estimates are 540, 590, 615, 650, and 690. Finally, suppose that you are the bidder whose estimate is 
21To be more exact, the best strategy is to choose a bid that you believe will be equal to or slightly 
above the second-highest expected reservation price conditional on your value being the highest.520  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
690 and that you win the auction with a bid of $6.80. Should you be happy 
about  winning? No—you will have paid $6.80 for $6.20 worth of pennies. You will have fallen prey to the winner’s curse : The winner of a common-value 
auction is often worse off than those who did not win because the winner was overly optimistic and, as a consequence, bid more for the item than it was actually worth.
The winner’s curse can arise in any common-value auction, and bidders 
often fail to take it into account. Suppose, for example, that your house needs to be painted. You ask five companies to give you cost estimates for the job, telling each that you will accept the lowest estimate. Who will win the job? It will prob-ably be the painter who has most seriously underestimated the amount of work involved. At first, that painter might be happy to have won the job, only later to realize that much more work is required than was anticipated. The same prob-lem can arise for oil companies bidding for offshore oil reserves when the size of the reserve and cost of extraction are uncertain (so that the value of the reserve is uncertain). Unless the companies take the winner’s curse into account, the win-ning bidder is likely to win by overestimating the value of the reserve and will thus pay more than the reserve is worth.
How should you take the winner’s curse into account when bidding for an 
item in a common-value auction? You must not only estimate the value of the item that you are bidding for, but also account for the fact that your estimate—and the estimates of the other bidders—are subject to error. To avoid the win-ner’s curse, you must reduce your maximum bid below your value estimate by an amount equal to the expected error of the winning bidder. The more precise your estimate, the less you need to reduce your bid. If you can’t assess the pre-cision of your estimate directly, you can estimate the variation in the estimates of the other bidders. If there is a lot of disagreement among these bidders, it is likely that your estimate will be similarly imprecise. To measure the variation in bids, you can use the standard deviation of the estimates, which can be calcu-lated using statistical methods.
Oil companies have been bidding for oil reserves for years, and thus are able 
to estimate this standard deviation quite well. They can thereby take the win-ner’s curse into account by reducing their maximum bids below their value estimates by an amount equal to the expected error of the winning bidder. As a result, oil companies rarely feel they have made a mistake after winning an auction. House painters, on the other hand, are often less sophisticated in their bidding decisions and suffer from the winner’s curse.
The winner’s curse is more likely to be a problem in a sealed-bid auction 
than in a traditional English auction. In a traditional auction, if you are the only bidder who is overly optimistic, you can still win the bidding by offering only slightly more than the second-highest bidder. Therefore, for the winner’s curse to be a problem, at least two bidders must be overly optimistic. By contrast, in a sealed-bid auction, your optimism could encourage you to outbid everyone else by a substantial margin.
Maximizing Auction Revenue
Now let’s return to the question of auction design from the viewpoint of the seller. Here are some useful tips for choosing the best auction format.
 1. In a private-value auction, you should encourage as many bidders as pos-
sible: Additional bidders increase the expected bid of the winner and the expected valuation of the second-highest bidder as well.• winner’s curse  Situation in 
which the winner of a common-value auction is worse off as a consequence of overestimating the value of the item and thereby overbidding.CHAPTER 13   •  Game Theory and Competitive Strategy  521
 2. In a common-value auction, you should (a) use an open rather than a sealed-
bid auction because, as a general rule, an English (open)  common-value auction will generate greater expected revenue than a sealed-bid auction; and (b) reveal information about the true value of the object being auc-tioned, thereby reducing concern about the winner’s curse and, conse-quently, encouraging more bidding.
 3. In a private-value auction, set a minimum bid equal to or even some-
what higher than the value to you of keeping the good for future sale. This will protect against a loss if there are relatively few bidders who do not value the good very highly. Moreover, it could increase the size of the bids by signaling to buyers that the object is valuable. Having the opportunity to try again to sell the good if there is no minimum bid is obviously an advantage; however, it can be a disadvantage if failure to sell the good the first time is seen as a signal of low quality to bidders in future auctions.
Why use an open auction? Recall that in order to avoid the winner’s curse, 
each bidder in a common value auction will bid below his individual valua-tion. The greater the uncertainty about the true value of the object, the greater the likelihood of an overbid, and therefore the greater the incentive for the bidder to reduce his bid. (If the bidder is risk-averse, this effect will be magni-fied.) However, the bidder faces less uncertainty in an English auction than in a sealed-bid auction because he can observe the prices at which other bidders drop out of the competition—an advantage that provides information about their valuations. In short, when you provide more information to bidders, risk-averse bidders will be encouraged to bid more because they will be more confi-dent that they can account for the possibility of a winner’s curse.
Bidding and Collusion
We have seen that sellers at auctions can obtain a significant share of the gains from trade by encouraging competition among buyers. It follows, therefore, that buyers can increase their bargaining power by reducing the number of bidders or the frequency of bidding. In some cases this can be accomplished legally through the formation of buying groups, but it may also be accom-plished illegally through collusive agreements that violate the antitrust laws. Collusion among buyers is not easy, because even if an “agreement” is reached, individual buyers will have an incentive to cheat by increasing their bids at the last minute in order to obtain the desired item. However, repeated auctions allow for participants to penalize those that break from the agree-ment by outbidding the “cheater” again and again. Buyer collusion is more of a problem in open-bid auctions than in the case of sealed bids because open auctions offer the best opportunity for colluding bidders to detect and punish cheating.
A well-known case of buyer collusion was the agreement in the mid-1980s 
among baseball owners to limit their bidding for free-agent players. The fact that such bidding was repeated and open made it possible for owners to retal-iate against those that bid too often and too aggressively. Collusion, however, is not limited to buyers. In 2001, two of the world’s most successful auction houses, Sotheby’s and Christie’s, were found guilty of agreeing to fix the price of commissions offered to sellers of auctioned items. Former Sotheby’s chairman Alfred Taubman was sentenced to a year in jail for his involvement in the scheme.522  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
EXAMPLE 13.7  AUCTIONING LEGAL SERVICES
In the United States, plaintiff attorneys often bring 
cases in which they represent classes of individuals who were allegedly harmed by defendants’ actions that adversely affect human health or well-being. The attorneys are typically paid on a contingent fee basis, which means they are paid nothing if they lose the case, but if they win the case, they receive a percentage of the amount recovered, typically around 30%.
In a number of instances, class action cases have 
followed successful investigations and prosecutions by government agencies. For example, after the U.S. government successfully sued Microsoft and found that it had monopolized the market for PC operat-ing systems, attorneys representing consumers who had purchased PCs filed suit to recover damages for excess payments. Because of the government suit, the lawyers for the class action plaintiffs had a head start that greatly simplified their work. Many of the critical documents had already been uncovered, and they did not have to prove that Microsoft was a monopoly in the PC operating systems market.As a result of cases such as this one, the percent-
age fee awards have been seen as unreasonably large relative to the efforts made by the attorneys. What could be done about this? A number of federal judges had a solution: hold auctions in which attor-neys bid for the right to represent the class of poten-tial plaintiffs. In a typical such auction, attorneys would offer a percentage fee as part of a sealed-bid process. In one unusual auction following on a criminal verdict against auction houses Sotheby’s and Christie’s, Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York allowed law firms to offer a broader range of payment terms as part of their bids. It turned out that the winning bidder was the law firm of Boies, Schiller, & Flexner, which bid a payment of 25 percent of the award on an amount recovered that is greater than $425 million. Months after tak-ing the case, David Boies settled with defendants for $512 million, earning the attorneys a $26.75 million fee (25 percent of the $107 million excess over the minimum of $425 million) and generating just over $475 million for members of the class.

Indeed, the Internet has lowered transaction costs by so much that individuals anywhere in the world can now trade relatively low-value items without leaving the comfort of home. Many Internet sites are now devoted to auctions at which partici-pants can buy and sell a wide variety of items. Let’s see how these Internet auctions work.

tion site in the United States is

antiques and automobiles to Beanie Babies and rare coins. Founded in 
1995 by Pierre Omidyar in an effort to sell a broken laser pointer, eBay dominates the online person-to-person auction industry. It recently listed millions of products for sale, including such unusual items as a Caribbean island, 154 acres in the Catskills, and a ghost town in Nevada. In 2011, eBay accounted for about 85 percent of all U.S. online auction sales, total-ling over $60 billion of merchandise sold. On average, over 14 million items are listed for sale at any given time.
How has eBay come to dominate the U.S. Internet auction market? Why 
haven’t other Internet auction sites (such as Yahoo and Amazon) succeeded in taking market share from eBay? The answer is that Internet auctions are subject to very strong network externalities.  If you wanted to auction off 
some rare coins or stamps which auction site would you choose? The one that had the largest number of potential bidders. Likewise, if you wanted to bid for rare coins or stamps, you would choose the auction site with the larg-est number of sellers. Thus, both sellers and buyers gravitate to the auction site with the largest market share. Because eBay was the first major Internet auction site, it began with a large market share, and its share grew thanks to the network externality.
To understand the critical role of network effects, look at what happened 
when eBay tried to expand internationally. In China it had to compete with Taobao, whose managers knew how important it was to gain an early market share advantage. Thus Taobao decided not to charge sellers any commis-sions, so that most of its revenue was from advertising. While its revenue was limited by this strategy, Taobao quickly became the dominant Internet auction site in China, with a market share exceeding 80 percent in 2010.
23 
And eBay likewise lost out in Japan, this time to Yahoo! Japan Auctions, which aggressively obtained an early market share lead. The strong network effect then made it nearly impossible for eBay (or anyone else) to challenge Yahoo!’s dominance in Japan.
Let’s return to the United States and see how eBay auctions operate. For 
single items, eBay uses an increasing price auction which works roughly as follows: Bids must be increased with minimum increments. The highest bid-der at the close of the auction wins and pays the seller a price equal to the second-highest bid plus the minimum increment by which bids are increased (say 25 cents). So, if you bid $20 for a particular DVD and you are the winning bidder, you will pay the second highest paid that was paid – say $19, plus the 25-cent minimum increment. The eBay increasing price auction does not cor-respond precisely to the auction formats described previously because there is a fixed and known stopping time, which can cause bidders to place bids strategically at the end of the auction.
Many Internet auctions are dominated by private-value items. (However, 
because anyone can put an item up for sale, there are common-value issues—how reliable is the seller, and are there possibilities for resale?) The private-value emphasis of these auctions is especially true of unique antiques that may have considerable value to particular bidders. With private-value auctions, you needn’t worry so much about the prior history of bidding: The bids of others In §4.5 we explain how 
network externalities affect sales of a product.
23According to Forbes , May 3, 2011.524  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
tell you about their preferences, but the value that you place on the object is 
personal to you. Although you want to win the bidding at a price as far below your valuation as possible, the winner’s curse needn’t be a concern: You can’t be disappointed if your value for the object is more than what you paid for it.
In the United States, the seller pays the buyer when an item is purchased. 
EBay’s profit from most auctions comes from the fees paid by the seller. In most auctions, the seller pays a fee when the item is put up for sale, and an additional fee when and if the item is sold. Of course, the issue of who ulti-mately bears the burden of these fees is a complex one. To illustrate, suppose that the product being sold on the Internet is a common value item that is widely available elsewhere (e.g., a music CD, a DVD, or a book). Then the fee is like a tax (but collected by eBay, not the government). Like a tax, the bur-den of the fees will be borne by both buyers and sellers, and as we explained in Section 9.6, will depend on the relative elasticities of demand and supply.
Finally, a few caveats are in order when buying items via Internet auc-
tions. Unlike traditional auction houses, low-end auction sites like eBay pro-vide only a forum for buyers and sellers to interact; they provide no quality control functions. Although many sites, including eBay, make available feed-back from buyers for each seller, this is usually the only evidence of a seller’s reliability that buyers receive. In recent years, eBay has established a buyer protection program, but the claims process can be lengthy. In addition, the possibility of bid manipulation looms large in Internet auctions. It is always possible that sellers may file spurious bids in order to manipulate the bidding process. Thus, “caveat emptor” (buyer beware) is a sound philosophy when buying items on the Internet.
In Section 9.6 we explain 
that the burden of a tax falls partly on the seller and partly on the buyers, depending on the relative elasticities of demand and supply.
SUMMARY
 1. A game is cooperative if the players can communicate 
and arrange binding contracts; otherwise, it is non-cooperative. In either kind of game, the most impor-tant aspect of strategy design is understanding your opponent’s position, and (if your opponent is rational) correctly deducing the likely response to your actions. Misjudging an opponent’s position is a common mistake, as Example 13.1 “Acquiring a Company”  
(page 490) illustrates.
24
 2. A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies such that all 
players are doing their best given the strategies of the other players. An equilibrium in dominant strategies is a special case of a Nash equilibrium; a dominant strategy is optimal no matter what the other players do. A Nash equilibrium relies on the rationality of 
each player. A maximin strategy is more conservative because it maximizes the minimum possible outcome.
 3. Some games have no Nash equilibria in pure strategies 
but have one or more equilibria in mixed strategies. A mixed strategy is one in which the player makes a random choice among two or more possible actions, based on a set of chosen probabilities.
 4. Strategies that are not optimal for a one-shot game 
may be optimal for a repeated game. Depending on the number of repetitions, a “tit-for-tat” strategy, in which you play cooperatively as long as your com-petitor does the same, may be optimal for the repeated prisoners’ dilemma.
24Here is the solution to Company A’s problem: It should offer nothing for Company T’s stock.  Remember 
that Company T will accept an offer only if it is greater than the per-share value under current manage-
ment. Suppose you offer $50. Thus Company T will accept this offer only if the outcome of the explora-
tion project results in a per-share value under current management of $50 or less. Any values between $0 and $100 are equally likely. Therefore, the expected value  of Company T’s stock, given that it accepts 
the offer —i.e., given that the outcome of the exploration project leads to a value less than $50—is $25. 
Under the management of Company A, therefore, the value would be (1.5)($25) = $37.5, which is less 
than $50. In fact, for any price P, if the offer is accepted, Company A can expect a value of only (3/4) P.CHAPTER 13   •  Game Theory and Competitive Strategy  525
 5. In a sequential game, the players move in turn. In some 
cases, the player who moves first has an  advantage. Players may then have an incentive to try to precom-mit themselves to particular actions before their com-petitors can do the same.
 6. An empty threat is a threat that one has no incentive 
to carry out. If one’s competitors are rational, empty threats are of no value. To make a threat credible, it is sometimes necessary to make a strategic move to con-strain one’s later behavior, thereby creating an incen-tive to carry out the threat.
 7. Bargaining situations are examples of cooperative 
games. As in noncooperative games, in bargaining, players can sometimes gain a strategic advantage by limiting their own flexibility. 8. To deter entry, an incumbent firm must convince any 
potential competitor that entry will be  unprofitable. This may be done by investing, and thereby giv-ing credibility to the threat that entry will be met by price warfare. Strategic trade policies by governments sometimes have this objective.
 9. Auctions can be conducted in a number of formats, 
including English (oral with increasing bids), Dutch (oral with decreasing bids), and sealed bid. The oppor-tunity for a seller to raise revenue and for a buyer to obtain an object at a reasonable price depends on the auction format, and on whether the items being auctioned have the same value to all bidders (as in a common-value auction) or different values to different bidders (as in a private-value auction).

EXERCISES
 1. In many oligopolistic industries, the same firms com-
pete over a long period of time, setting prices and observing each other’s behavior repeatedly. Given the large number of repetitions, why don’t collusive out-comes typically result?
 2. Many industries are often plagued by overcapacity: 
Firms simultaneously invest in capacity expansion, so that total capacity far exceeds demand. This happens not only in industries in which demand is highly vola-tile and unpredictable, but also in industries in which demand is fairly stable. What factors lead to overca-pacity? Explain each briefly.
 3. Two computer firms, A and B, are planning to mar-
ket network systems for office information manage-ment. Each firm can develop either a fast, high-quality  system (High), or a slower, low-quality system (Low). 
Market research indicates that the resulting profits to each firm for the alternative strategies are given by the following payoff matrix:
Firm B

Firm AHigh 50, 40 60, 45
Low 55, 55 15, 20
 a. If both firms make their decisions at the same time 
and follow maximin  (low-risk) strategies, what will 
the outcome be?526  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy

but that Firm A has a head start in planning and can 
commit first. Now what will be the outcome? What will be the outcome if Firm B has the head start in 
planning and can commit first?
 c. Getting a head start costs money. (You have to gear 
up a large engineering team.) Now consider the two-stage  game in which, first, each firm decides 
how much money to spend to speed up its plan-ning, and, second , it announces which product ( H 
or L) it will produce. Which firm will spend more 
to speed up its planning? How much will it spend? Should the other firm spend anything  to speed up 
its planning? Explain.

come? How much would that firm need to offer the other to persuade it to collude?
 5. Two major networks are competing for viewer rat-
ings in the 8:00–9:00 p.m. and 9:00–10:00 p.m. slots on a given weeknight. Each has two shows to fill these time periods and is juggling its lineup. Each can choose to put its “bigger” show first or to place it second in the 9:00–10:00 p.m. slot. The combination of decisions leads to the following “ratings points” results:

strategy, what will be the resulting equilibrium?

selection first? If Network 2 goes first?
 d. Suppose the network managers meet to coordinate 
schedules and Network 1 promises to schedule its big show first. Is this promise credible? What would be the likely outcome?

and believes that the other country will act in its own interest. Does either country have a dominant strategy? What will be the equilibrium policies if each country acts rationally to maximize its wel-fare?
 b. Now assume that Japan is not certain that the 
United States will behave rationally. In particular, Japan is concerned that U.S. politicians may want to penalize Japan even if that does not maximize U.S. welfare. How might this concern affect Japan’s choice of strategy? How might this change the equi-librium?CHAPTER 13   •  Game Theory and Competitive Strategy  527
 8. You are a duopolist producer of a homogeneous good. 
Both you and your competitor have zero marginal costs. The market demand curve is
P=30-Q
where Q = Q
1 + Q2. Q1 is your output and Q2 your com-
petitor’s output. Your competitor has also read this book.
 a. Suppose you will play this game only once. If you 
and your competitor must announce your outputs at the same time, how much will you choose to produce? What do you expect your profit to be? Explain.
 b. Suppose you are told that you must announce your 
output before  your competitor does. How much 
will you produce in this case, and how much do you think your competitor will produce? What do you expect your profit to be? Is announcing first an advantage or a disadvantage? Explain briefly. How much would you pay for the option of announcing either first or second?
 c. Suppose instead that you are to play the first 
round of a series of 10 rounds (with the same com-petitor). In each round, you and your competi-tor announce your outputs at the same time. You want to maximize the sum of your profits over the 10 rounds. How much will you produce in the first round? How much do you expect to produce in the tenth round? In the ninth round? Explain briefly.
 d. Once again you will play a series of 10 rounds. 
This time, however, in each round your competi-tor will announce its output before you announce yours. How will your answers to (c) change in this 
case?
 9. You play the following bargaining game. Player A 
moves first and makes Player B an offer for the divi-
sion of $100. (For example, Player A could suggest 
that she take $60 and Player B take $40.) Player B can 
accept or reject the offer. If he rejects it, the amount of money available drops to $90, and he then makes an offer for the division of this amount. If Player A 
rejects this offer, the amount of money drops to $80 and Player A makes an offer for its division. If Player 
B rejects this offer, the amount of money drops to 0. 
Both players are rational, fully informed, and want to maximize their payoffs. Which player will do best in this game?
  *10. Defendo has decided to introduce a revolutionary 
video game. As the first firm in the market, it will have a monopoly position for at least some time. In decid-ing what type of manufacturing plant to build, it has the choice of two technologies. Technology A is pub-
licly available and will result in annual costs of
C
A(q)=10+8q
Technology B is a proprietary technology developed in 
Defendo’s research labs. It involves a higher fixed cost of production but lower marginal costs:
C
B(q)=60+2q
Defendo must decide which technology to adopt. 
Market demand for the new product is P = 20 /H11002 Q, 
where Q is total industry output.
 a. Suppose Defendo were certain that it would main-
tain its monopoly position in the market for the entire product lifespan (about five years) without threat of entry. Which technology would you advise Defendo to adopt? What would be Defendo’s profit given this choice?
 b. Suppose Defendo expects its archrival, Offendo, to 
consider entering the market shortly after Defendo introduces its new product. Offendo will have access only to Technology A. If Offendo does enter 
the market, the two firms will play a Cournot game (in quantities) and arrive at the Cournot-Nash equilibrium. i. If Defendo adopts Technology A and Offendo 
enters the market, what will be the profit of each firm? Would Offendo choose to enter the market given these profits?
 ii. If Defendo adopts Technology B and Offendo 
enters the market, what will be the profit of 
each firm? Would Offendo choose to enter the 
market given these profits?
 iii. Which technology would you advise Defendo 
to adopt given the threat of possible entry? What will be Defendo’s profit given this choice? What will be consumer surplus given this choice?
 c. What happens to social welfare (the sum of con-
sumer surplus and producer profit) as a result of the threat of entry in this market? What happens to equilibrium price? What might this imply about the role of potential  competition in limiting market 
power?

a pistol. From fixed positions, they fire at each other’s balloons. When a balloon is hit, its owner is out. When only one balloon remains, its owner gets a $1000 prize. At the outset, the players decide by lot the order in which they will fire, and each player can choose any remaining balloon as his target. Everyone knows that A is the best shot and always hits the  target, that B hits 528  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
the target with probability .9, and that C hits the target 
with probability .8. Which contestant has the highest probability of winning the $1000? Explain why.
 12. An antique dealer regularly buys objects at hometown 
auctions whose bidders are limited to other dealers. Most of her successful bids turn out to be financially worthwhile because she is able to resell the antiques for a profit. On occasion, however, she travels to a nearby town to bid in an auction that is open to the public. She often finds that on the rare occasions in which she does bid successfully, she is disappointed—the antique cannot be sold at a profit. Can you explain the difference in her success between the two sets of circumstances? 13. You are in the market for a new house and have decided 
to bid for a house at auction. You believe that the value of the house is between $125,000 and $150,000, but you are uncertain as to where in the range it might be. You do know, however, that the seller has reserved the right to withdraw the house from the market if the winning bid is not satisfactory.
 a. Should you bid in this auction? Why or why not?
 b. Suppose you are a building contractor. You plan 
to improve the house and then to resell it at a profit. How does this situation affect your answer to (a)? Does it depend on the extent to which your skills are uniquely suitable to improving this par-ticular house? 529
So far we have concentrated on output markets : markets for goods 
and services that firms sell and consumers purchase. In this chapter, we discuss factor markets : markets for labor, raw materi-
als, and other inputs to production. Much of our material will be famil-iar because the same forces that shape supply and demand in output markets also affect factor markets.
We have seen that some output markets are perfectly or almost per-
fectly competitive, while producers in others have market power. The same is true for factor markets. We will examine three different factor market structures:
 1. Perfectly competitive factor markets;
 2. Markets in which buyers of factors have monopsony power;
 3. Markets in which sellers of factors have monopoly power.
We will also point out instances in which equilibrium in the factor 
market depends on the extent of market power in output  markets.
14.1  Competitive Factor Markets
A competitive factor market  is one in which there are a large number of 
sellers and buyers of a factor of production, such as labor or raw mate-rials. Because no single seller or buyer can affect the price of a given factor, each is a price taker. For example, if individual firms that buy lumber to construct homes purchase a small share of the total volume of lumber available, their purchasing decision will have no effect on price. Likewise, if each supplier of lumber controls only a small share of the market, no individual supplier’s decision will affect the price of the lumber that he sells. Instead, the price of lumber (and the total quantity produced) will be determined by the aggregate supply and demand for lumber.
We begin by analyzing the demands for a factor by individual firms. 
These demands are added to get market demand. We then shift to the supply side of the market and show how market price and input levels are determined.14.1

Demand for a Factor Input When Only  
One Input Is Variable
Like demand curves for the final goods that result from the production process, 
demand curves for factors of production are downward sloping. Unlike con-sumers’ demands for goods and services, however, factor demands are derived 
demands:  They depend on, and are derived from, the firm’s level of output and 
the costs of inputs. For example, the demand of the Microsoft Corporation for computer programmers is a derived demand that depends not only on the current salaries of programmers, but also on how much software Microsoft expects to sell.
To analyze factor demands, we will use the material from Chapter 7 that 
shows how a firm chooses its production inputs. We will assume that the firm produces its output using two inputs, capital K and labor L, that can be hired at 
the prices r (the rental cost of capital) and w (the wage rate), respectively.
1 We 
will also assume that the firm has its plant and equipment in place (as in a short-run analysis) and must only decide how much labor to hire.
Suppose that the firm has hired a certain number of workers and wants to 
know whether it is profitable to hire one additional worker. This will be profit-able if the additional revenue from the output of the worker’s labor is greater than its cost. The additional revenue from an incremental unit of labor, the  marginal revenue product of labor,  is denoted MRP
L. The cost of an incremen-
tal unit of labor is the wage rate, w. Thus, it is profitable to hire more labor if the 
MRPL is at least as large as the wage rate w.
How do we measure the MRPL? It’s the additional output obtained from the addi-
tional unit of this labor, multiplied by the additional revenue from an extra unit of out-put. The additional output is given by the marginal product of labor MP
L and 
the additional revenue by the marginal revenue MR.
Formally, the marginal revenue product is /H9004R//H9004L, where L is the number of 
units of labor input and R is revenue. The additional output per unit of labor, 
the MPL, is given by /H9004Q//H9004L, and marginal revenue, MR, is equal to /H9004R//H9004Q. 
Because /H9004R//H9004L = (/H9004R)/(/H9004Q)(/H9004Q//H9004L), it follows that
 MRP L=(MR)(MP L) (14.1)
This important result holds for any competitive factor market, whether or 
not the output market is competitive. However, to examine the characteristics of the MRP
L, let’s begin with the case of a perfectly competitive output (and input) 
market. In a competitive output market, a firm will sell all its output at the mar-ket price P. The marginal revenue from the sale of an additional unit of output 
is then equal to P. In this case, the marginal revenue product of labor is equal to 
the marginal product of labor times the price of the product:
 MRP
L=(MP L)(P) (14.2)
The higher of the two curves in Figure 14.1 represents the MRPL curve for a 
firm in a competitive output market. Note that because there are diminishing marginal returns to labor, the marginal product of labor falls as the amount of labor increases. The marginal revenue product curve thus slopes downward, even though the price of the output is constant.• derived demand  Demand 
for an input that depends on, and is derived from, both the firm’s level of output and the cost of inputs.
• marginal revenue product  
Additional revenue resulting 
from the sale of output created 
by the use of one additional unit of an input.
Recall that in §8.3, marginal revenue is defined to be the increase in revenue resulting from a one-unit increase in output.
In §8.2, we explain that because the demand facing 
each firm in a competitive 
market is perfectly elastic, 
each firm will sell its out-
put at a price equal to its  average revenue and to its 
marginal revenue.
In §6.2, we explain the law of diminishing marginal returns—as the use of an input increases with other inputs fixed, the resulting additions to output will eventually decrease.
1We implicitly assume that all inputs to production are identical in quality. Differences in workers’ 
skills and abilities are discussed in Chapter 17.CHAPTER 14   •  Markets for Factor Inputs  531
The lower curve in Figure 14.1 is the MRPL curve when the firm has monop-
oly power in the output market. When firms have monopoly power, they face a downward-sloping demand curve and must therefore lower the price of all units of the product in order to sell more of it. As a result, marginal revenue is always less than price (MR < P). This explains why the monopolistic curve lies below 
the competitive curve and why marginal revenue falls as output increases. Thus the marginal revenue product curve slopes downward in this case because the marginal revenue curve and the marginal product curve slope downward.
Note that the marginal revenue product tells us how much the firm should be 
willing to pay to hire an additional unit of labor. As long as the MRP
L is greater 
than the wage rate, the firm should hire more labor. If the marginal revenue prod-uct is less than the wage rate, the firm should lay off workers. Only when the marginal revenue product is equal to the wage rate will the firm have hired the profit-maximizing amount of labor. The profit-maximizing condition is therefore
 MRP
L=w (14.3)
Figure 14.2 illustrates this condition. The demand for labor curve DL is the 
MRPL. Note that the quantity of labor demanded increases as the wage rate falls. Wage

MARGINAL REVENUE PRODUCT
In a competitive factor market in which the producer is a price taker, the buyer’s demand for 
an input is given by the marginal revenue product curve. The MRP curve falls because the mar-ginal product of labor falls as hours of work increase. When the producer of the product has  monopoly power, the demand for the input is also given by the MRP curve. In this case, how-
ever, the MRP curve falls because both the marginal product of labor and marginal  revenue fall.532  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
Because the labor market is perfectly competitive, the firm can hire as many 
workers as it wants at the market wage w* and is not able to affect the market 
wage. The supply of labor curve facing the firm SL is thus a horizontal line. The 
profit-maximizing amount of labor that the firm hires, L*, is at the intersection of 
the supply and demand curves.
Figure 14.3 shows how the quantity of labor demanded changes in response 
to a drop in the market wage rate from w1 to w2. The wage rate might decrease 
if more people entering the labor force are looking for jobs for the first time (as happened, for example, when the baby boomers came of age). The quantity of labor demanded by the firm is initially L
1, at the intersection of MRPL and S1. In §8.3, we explain that a 
firm maximizes its profit by choosing an output at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost.

A SHIFT IN THE SUPPLY OF LABOR
When the supply of labor facing the firms is S1, the 
firm hires L1 units of labor at wage w1. But when the 
market wage rate decreases and the supply of labor shifts to S
2, the firm maximizes its profit by moving 
along the demand for labor curve until the new wage rate w
2 is equal to the marginal revenue product of 
labor. As a result, L2 units of labor are hired.FIGURE 14.2
HIRING BY A FIRM IN THE LABOR MARKET 
(WITH FIXED CAPITAL)
In a competitive labor market, a firm faces a perfectly 
elastic supply of labor SL and can hire as many work-
ers as it wants at a wage rate w*. The firm’s demand 
for labor DL is given by its marginal revenue product 
of labor MRPL. The profit-maximizing firm will hire L* 
units of labor at the point where the marginal rev-enue product of labor is equal to the wage rate.CHAPTER 14   •  Markets for Factor Inputs  533
However, when the supply of labor curve shifts from S1 to S2, the wage falls 
from w1 to w2 and the quantity of labor demanded increases from L1 to L2.
Factor markets are similar to output markets in many ways. For example, the 
factor market profit-maximizing condition that the marginal revenue product of labor be equal to the wage rate is analogous to the output market condition that marginal revenue be equal to marginal cost. To see why this is true, recall that MRP
L = (MPL)(MR) and divide both sides of equation (14.3) by the marginal 
product of labor. Then,
 MR =w/MP L (14.4)
Because MPL measures additional output per unit of input, the right-hand 
side of equation (14.4) measures the marginal cost of an additional unit of out-put (the wage rate multiplied by the labor needed to produce one unit of out-put). Equation (14.4) shows that both the hiring and output choices of the firm follow 
the same rule: Inputs or outputs are chosen so that marginal revenue (from the sale of output) is equal to marginal cost (from the purchase of inputs) . This principle holds in 
both competitive and noncompetitive markets.
Demand for a Factor Input When Several  
Inputs Are Variable
When the firm simultaneously chooses quantities of two or more variable 
inputs, the hiring problem becomes more difficult because a change in the price of one input will change the demand for others. Suppose, for example, that both labor and assembly-line machinery are variable inputs for producing farm equipment. Let’s say that we wish to determine the firm’s demand for labor curve. As the wage rate falls, more labor will be demanded even if the firm’s investment in machinery is unchanged. But as labor becomes less expensive, the marginal cost of producing the farm equipment falls. Consequently, it is profit-able for the firm to increase its output. In that case, the firm is likely to invest in additional machinery to expand production capacity. Expanding the use of machinery causes the marginal revenue product of labor curve to shift to the right; in turn, the quantity of labor demanded increases.
Figure 14.4 illustrates this. Suppose that when the wage rate is $20 per hour, 
the firm hires 100 worker-hours, as shown by point A on the MRP
L1 curve. Now 
consider what happens when the wage rate falls to $15 per hour. Because the marginal revenue product of labor is now greater than the wage rate, the firm will demand more labor. But the MRP
L1 curve describes the demand for labor 
when the use of machinery is fixed. In fact, a greater amount of labor causes the marginal product of capital  to rise, which encourages the firm to rent more 
machinery as well as hire more labor. Because there is more machinery, the mar-ginal product of labor will increase. (With more machinery, workers can be more productive.) The marginal revenue product curve will therefore shift to the right (to MRP
L2). Thus, when the wage rate falls, the firm will use 140 hours of labor. 
This is shown by a new point on the demand curve, C, rather than 120 hours as 
given by B. A and C are both on the firm’s demand for labor curve (with machin-
ery variable) DL; B is not.
Note that as constructed, the demand for labor curve is more elastic than 
either of the two marginal product of labor curves (which presume no change in the amount of machinery). Thus, when capital inputs are variable in the long run, there is a greater elasticity of demand because firms can substitute capital for labor in the production process.534  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
The Market Demand Curve
When we aggregated the individual demand curves of consumers to obtain the 
market demand curve for a product, we were concerned with a single industry. However, a factor input such as skilled labor is demanded by firms in many different industries. Moreover, as we move from industry to industry, we are likely to find that firms’ demands for labor (which are derived in part from the demands for the firms’ output) vary substantially. Therefore, to obtain the total market demand for labor curve, we must first determine each industry’s demand for labor, and then add the industry demand curves horizontally. The second step is straightforward. Adding industry demand curves for labor to obtain a market demand curve for labor is just like adding individual product demand curves to obtain the market demand curve for that product. So let’s concentrate our attention on the more difficult first step.
DETERMINING INDUSTRY DEMAND  The first step—determining industry 
demand—takes into account the fact that both the level of output produced by the firm and its product price change as the prices of the inputs to production change. It is easiest to determine market demand when there is a single producer. In that case, the marginal revenue product curve is the industry demand curve for the input. When there are many firms, however, the analysis is more com-plex because of the possible interaction among the firms. Consider, for instance, the demand for labor when output markets are perfectly competitive. Then,  the marginal revenue product of labor is the product of the price of the good and the marginal product of labor (see equation 14.2), as shown by the curve MRP
L1 
in Figure 14.5 (a).
Suppose initially that the wage rate for labor is $15 per hour and that the firm 
demands 100 worker-hours of labor. Now the wage rate for this firm falls to $10 per hour. If no other firms could hire workers at the lower wage, then our firm would hire 150 worker-hours of labor (by finding the point on the MRP
L1 curve 
that corresponds to the $10-per-hour wage rate). But if the wage rate falls for all firms in an industry, the industry as a whole will hire more labor. This will Recall from §4.3 that the 
market demand curve for a product shows how much of the product consumers are willing to buy as the price of the product changes.Wage

FIRM’S DEMAND CURVE FOR  
LABOR (WITH VARIABLE CAPITAL)
When two or more inputs are variable, 
a firm’s demand for one input depends on the marginal revenue product of both  inputs. When the wage rate is $20, A rep-
resents one point on the firm’s demand for  labor curve. When the wage rate falls 
to $15, the marginal product of capital rises, encouraging the firm to rent more  machinery and hire more labor. As a  result, 
the MRP curve shifts from MRP
L1 to MRPL2, 
generating a new point C on the firm’s 
 demand for labor curve. Thus A and C are 
on the  demand for labor curve, but B is not.CHAPTER 14   •  Markets for Factor Inputs  535
lead to more output from the industry, a shift to the right of the industry supply 
curve, and a lower market price for its product.
In Figure 14.5 (a), when the product price falls, the original marginal rev-
enue product curve shifts downward, from MRPL1 to MRPL2. This shift results 
in a lower quantity of labor demanded by the firm—120 worker-hours rather than 150. Consequently, industry demand for labor will be lower than it would be if only one firm were able to hire workers at the lower wage. Figure 14.5 (b) illustrates this. The lighter line shows the horizontal sum of the indi-vidual firms’ demands for labor that would result if product price did not change as the wage falls. The darker line shows the industry demand curve for labor, which takes into account the fact that product price will fall as all firms expand their output in response to the lower wage rate. When the wage rate is $15 per hour, industry demand for labor is L
0 worker-hours. When 
it falls to $10 per hour, industry demand increases to L1. Note that this is a 
smaller increase than L2, which would occur if the product price were fixed. 
The aggregation of industry demand curves into the market demand curve for labor is the final step: To complete it, we simply add the labor demanded in all industries.
The derivation of the market demand curve for labor (or for any other input) 
is essentially the same when the output market is noncompetitive. The only difference is that it is more difficult to predict the change in product price in response to a change in the wage rate because each firm in the market is likely to be pricing strategically rather than taking price as given.Wage

THE INDUSTRY DEMAND FOR LABOR
The demand curve for labor of a competitive firm, MRPL1 in (a), takes the product price as given. But as the 
wage rate falls from $15 to $10 per hour, the product price also falls. Thus the firm’s demand curve shifts down-
ward to MRPL2. As a result, the industry demand curve, shown in (b), is more inelastic than the demand curve 
that would be obtained if the product price were assumed to be unchanged.536  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
Jet fuel costs have been highly volatile 
during the past several decades, gen-erally increasing and decreasing in line with oil prices. When fuel prices were high, they made up about 30 percent of airline operating costs, and when they were low, they made up 10 to 15 percent  
of costs. Overall, jet fuel remains the second-highest expense for airlines (after labor) generally.
Understanding the demand for jet fuel is important to managers of 
oil refineries, who must decide how much jet fuel to produce. It is also crucial to managers of airlines, who must project fuel purchases and costs when fuel prices rise and decide whether to invest in more fuel-efficient planes.
2
The effect of the increase in fuel costs on the airline industry depends on 
the ability of airlines either to cut fuel usage by reducing weight (by carrying less excess fuel) and flying more slowly (reducing drag and increasing engine efficiency) or to pass on their higher costs in customer prices. Thus the price elasticity of demand for jet fuel depends both on the ability to conserve fuel and on the elasticities of demand and supply of travel.
To measure the short-run elasticity of demand for jet fuel, we use as the 
quantity of fuel demanded the number of gallons of fuel used by an airline in all markets within its domestic route network. The price of jet fuel is mea-sured in dollars per gallon. A statistical analysis of demand must control for factors other than price that can explain why some firms demand more fuel than others. Some airlines, for example, use more fuel-efficient jet aircraft than others. A second factor is the length of flights: The shorter the flight, the more fuel consumed per mile of travel. Both of these factors were included in a statistical analysis that relates the quantity of fuel demanded to its price. Table 14.1 shows some short-run price elasticities. (They do not account for the introduction of new types of aircraft.)
The jet fuel price elasticities for the airlines range in value from −.06 (for 
American) to −.15 (for Delta). Overall, the results show that the demand for jet fuel as an input to the production of airline flight-miles is very inelastic. This finding is not surprising: In the short run, there is no good substitute for In §2.4, we define the price 
elasticity of demand as the percentage change in quantity demanded resulting from a 1-percent change in the price of a good.
2This example is drawn in part from Joseph M. Cigliano, “The Demand for Jet Fuel by the U.S. 
Domestic Trunk Airlines,” Business Economics  (September 1982): 32–36.EXAMPLE 14.1  THE DEMAND FOR JET FUEL

jet fuel. The long-run elasticity of demand is higher, however, because air-
lines can eventually introduce more energy-efficient airplanes.
Figure 14.6 shows the short- and long-run demands for jet fuel. The short-
run demand curve, MRPSR, is much less elastic than the long-run demand curve 
because it takes time to substitute newer, more fuel-efficient airplanes when the price of fuel goes up.Price

THE SHORT- AND LONG-RUN DEMAND FOR  
JET FUEL
The short-run demand for jet fuel MRPSR is more inelastic 
than the long-run demand MRPLR. In the short run, airlines 
cannot reduce fuel consumption much when fuel prices  increase. In the long run, however, they can switch to longer, 
more fuel-efficient routes and put more fuel-efficient planes into service.
The Supply of Inputs to a Firm
When the market for a factor input is perfectly competitive, a firm can purchase 
as much of that input as it wants at a fixed market price, which is determined by the intersection of the market demand and supply curves, as shown in Figure 14.7 (a). The input supply curve facing a firm is then perfectly elastic. Thus, in Figure 14.7 (b), a firm is buying fabric at $10 per yard to sew into clothing. Because the firm is only a small part of the fabric market, it can buy all it wants without affecting the price.
In Section 10.5 we explained that the supply curve AE facing the firm in 
Figure 14.7 (b) is its average expenditure curve  (just as the demand curve facing 
a firm is its average revenue curve ), because it represents the price per unit that the 
firm pays for the good. On the other hand, the marginal expenditure curve  rep-
resents the firm’s expenditure on an additional unit  that it buys. (The marginal 
expenditure curve in a factor market is analogous to the marginal revenue curve in the output market.) The marginal expenditure depends on whether you are a competitive buyer or a buyer with monopsony power. If you are a competitive buyer, the cost of each unit is the same no matter how many units you purchase; it is the market price of the good. The price paid is the average expenditure per unit, and the marginal expenditure is equal to the average. Consequently, when the factor market is competitive, the average expenditure and marginal expenditure curves are identical horizontal lines, just as the marginal and aver-age revenue curves are identical (and horizontal) for a competitive firm in the output market.• average expenditure

How much of the input should a firm facing a competitive factor mar-
ket purchase? As long as the marginal revenue product curve lies above the  marginal expenditure curve, profit can be increased by purchasing more of the input because the benefit of an additional unit (MRP) exceeds the cost (ME). However, when the marginal revenue product curve lies below the marginal expenditure curve, some units yield benefits that are less than cost. Therefore, profit maximization requires that marginal revenue product be equal to marginal 
expenditure :
 
ME=MRP  (14.5)
When we considered the special case of a competitive output market, we saw 
that the firm bought inputs, such as labor, up to the point at which the marginal revenue product was equal to the price of the input 
v, as in equation (14.3). In 
the competitive case, therefore, the condition for profit maximization is that the price of the input be equal to marginal expenditure:

A FIRM’S INPUT SUPPLY IN A COMPETITIVE FACTOR MARKET
In a competitive factor market, a firm can buy any amount of the input it wants without  affecting 
the price. Therefore, the firm faces a perfectly elastic supply curve for that input. As a  result, 
the quantity of the input purchased by the producer of the product is determined by the intersection of the input demand and supply curves. In (a), the industry quantity demanded 
and quantity supplied of fabric are equated at a price of $10 per yard. In (b), the firm faces a 
horizontal marginal expenditure curve at a price of $10 per yard of fabric and chooses to buy 50 yards.CHAPTER 14   •  Markets for Factor Inputs  539
In our example, the price of the fabric ($10 per yard) is determined in the com-
petitive fabric market shown in Figure 14.7 (a) at the intersection of the demand and supply curves. Figure 14.7 (b) shows the amount of fabric purchased by a firm at the intersection of the marginal expenditure and marginal revenue prod-uct curves. When 50 yards of fabric are purchased, the marginal expenditure of $10 is equal to the marginal revenue from the sale of clothing made possible by the increased use of fabric in the production process. If less than 50 yards of fabric were purchased, the firm would be forgoing an opportunity to make additional profit from clothing sales. If more than 50 yards were purchased, the cost of the fabric would be greater than the additional revenue from the sale of the extra clothing.
The Market Supply of Inputs
The market supply curve for a factor input is usually upward sloping. We saw in Chapter 8 that the market supply for a good sold in a competitive market is usually upward sloping because the marginal cost of producing the good is typically increasing. This is also the case for fabric and other raw material inputs.
When the input is labor, however, people rather than firms are making sup-
ply decisions. In this case, utility maximization by workers rather than profit maximization by firms determines supply. In the discussion that follows, we use the analysis of income and substitution effects from Chapter 4 to show that although the market supply curve for labor can be upward sloping, it may also, as in Figure 14.8, be backward bending . In other words, a higher wage rate can 
lead to less labor being supplied.
To see why a labor supply curve may be backward bending, divide the day 
into hours of work and hours of leisure. Leisure  is a term that describes enjoy-
able non-work activities, including sleeping, eating, and household chores. Work   benefits the worker only through the income that it generates. We also 
assume that a worker has the flexibility to choose how many hours per day to work.
The wage rate measures the price that the worker places on leisure time, 
because his or her wage measures the amount of money that the worker gives In §8.6, we explain that the 
short-run market supply curve shows the amount of output that will be produced by firms in the market for every possible price.
In §4.2, we explain that an increase in the price of a good has two effects: The real purchasing power of each consumer decreases (the income effect) and the good becomes relatively expensive (the substitution effect).

BACKWARD-BENDING SUPPLY OF LABOR
When the wage rate increases, the hours of work supplied 
increase initially but can eventually decrease as individuals choose to enjoy more leisure and to work less. The back-ward-bending portion of the labor supply curve arises when the income effect of the higher wage (which encourages more leisure) is greater than the substitution effect (which encourages more work).540  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
up to enjoy leisure. As the wage rate increases, therefore, the price of leisure also 
increases. This price change brings about both a substitution effect (a change in relative price with utility held constant) and an income effect (a change in util-ity with relative prices unchanged). There is a substitution effect because the higher price of leisure encourages workers to substitute work for leisure. An income effect occurs because the higher wage rate increases the worker’s pur-chasing power. With higher income, the worker can buy more of many goods, one of which is leisure. If more leisure was chosen, it is because the income effect has encouraged the worker to work fewer hours. Income effects can be large because wages are the primary component of most people’s income. When the income effect outweighs the substitution effect, the result is a backward-bending supply curve.
Figure 14.9 illustrates how a backward-bending supply curve for labor can 
result from the work–leisure decision for a typical weekday. The horizontal axis shows hours of leisure per day, the vertical axis income generated by work. (We assume there are no other sources of income.) Initially the wage rate is $10 per hour, and the budget line is given by PQ. Point P, for example, 
shows that if an individual worked a 24-hour day he would earn an income of $240.
The worker maximizes utility by choosing point A, thus enjoying 16 hours 
of leisure per day (with 8 hours of work) and earning $80. When the wage rate increases to $30 per hour, the budget line rotates about the horizontal intercept to line RQ. (Only 24 hours of leisure are possible.) Now the worker maximizes 
utility at B by choosing 19 hours of leisure per day (with 5 hours of work), 
while earning $150. If only the substitution effect came into play, the higher wage rate would encourage the worker to work 12 hours (at C) instead of 8. Income

SUBSTITUTION AND  
INCOME EFFECTS OF  A WAGE INCREASE
When the wage rate increases 
from $10 to $30 per hour, the worker’s budget line shifts from PQ to RQ. In response, 
the worker moves from A to B 
while decreasing work hours from 8 to 5. The reduction in hours worked arises because the income effect outweighs the substitution effect. In this case, the supply of labor curve is backward bending.CHAPTER 14   •  Markets for Factor Inputs  541
However, the income effect works in the opposite direction. It overcomes the 
substitution effect and lowers the work day from 8 hours to 5.
In real life, a backward-bending labor supply curve might apply to a college 
student working during the summer to earn living expenses for the school year. As soon as a target level of earnings is reached, the student stops working and allocates more time to leisure. An increase in the wage rate will then lead to fewer hours worked because it enables the student to reach the target level of earnings more quickly. The backward-bending supply curve also applies to taxi drivers. As we saw in Example 5.9, for taxi drivers who have a daily targeted earnings goal, an increase in the hourly wage will reduce the number of hours that the drivers work.
EXAMPLE 14.2   LABOR SUPPLY FOR ONE- AND TWO-EARNER 
HOUSEHOLDS
One of the most dramatic changes in the labor mar-
ket in the twentieth century has been the increase in women’s participation in the labor force. Whereas only 34 percent of women had entered the labor force in 1950, the number had risen to just under 60 percent by 2010. Married women account for a substantial portion of this increase. The increased role of women in the labor market has also had a major impact on housing markets: Where to live and work has increasingly become a joint husband-and-wife decision.
The complex nature of the work choice was 
analyzed in a study that compared the work decisions of 94 unmarried females with the work decisions of heads of households and spouses in 397 families.
3 One way to describe the work 
decisions of the various family groups is to cal-culate labor supply elasticities. Each elasticity relates the numbers of hours worked not only to the wage earned by the head of the household, but also to the wage of the other member of two-earner households. Table 14.2 summarizes the results.
When a higher wage rate leads to fewer hours 
worked, the labor supply curve is backward bend-ing: The income effect, which encourages more leisure, outweighs the substitution effect, which encourages more work. The elasticity of labor  supply is then negative. Table 14.2 shows that heads 
of one-earner families with children and two-earner

14.2   Equilibrium in a Competitive 
Factor Market
A competitive factor market is in equilibrium when the price of the input equates 
the quantity demanded to the quantity supplied. Figure 14.10 (a) shows such an equilibrium for a labor market. At point A, the equilibrium wage rate is w
C 
and the equilibrium quantity supplied is LC. Because they are well informed, all 
workers receive the identical wage and generate the identical marginal revenue product of labor wherever they are employed. If any worker had a wage lower than her marginal product, a firm would find it profitable to offer that worker a higher wage.
If the output market is also perfectly competitive, the demand curve for an 
input measures the benefit that consumers of the product place on the addi-tional use of the input in the production process. The wage rate also reflects the cost to the firm and to society of using an additional unit of the input. Thus, at A 
in Figure 14.10 (a), the marginal benefit of an hour of labor (its marginal revenue product MRP
L) is equal to its marginal cost (the wage rate w).
When output and input markets are both perfectly competitive, resources 
are used efficiently because the difference between total benefits and total costs is maximized. Efficiency requires that the additional revenue generated by employing an additional unit of labor (the marginal revenue product of labor, MRP
L) equal the benefit to consumers of the additional output, which is given 
by the price of the product times the marginal product of labor, ( P)(MPL).
When the output market is not perfectly competitive, the condition  
MRPL = (P)(MPL) no longer holds. Note in Figure 14.10 (b) that the curve repre-
senting the product price multiplied by the marginal product of labor [( P)(MPL)] 
lies above the marginal revenue product curve [(MR)(MPL)]. Point B is the equi-
librium wage wM and the equilibrium labor supply LM. But because the price of 
the product is a measure of the value to consumers of each additional unit of output that they buy, (P)(MP
L) is the value that consumers place on additional 
units of labor. Therefore, when LM laborers are employed, the marginal cost to 
the firm wM is less than the marginal benefit to consumers vM. Although the firm 
is maximizing its profit, its output is below the efficient level and it uses less than the efficient level of the input. Economic efficiency would be increased if more laborers were hired and, consequently, more output produced. (The gains to consumers would outweigh the firm’s lost profit.)
Economic Rent
The concept of economic rent helps explain how factor markets work. When discussing output markets in the long run in Chapter 8, we defined  economic rent as the payments received by a firm over and above the  minimum cost In §9.2, we explain that in 
a perfectly competitive mar-ket, efficiency is achieved because the sum of aggre-gate consumer and producer surplus is maximized.
In §8.7, we explain that economic rent is the amount that firms are willing to pay for an input less the  minimum amount necessary 
to buy it.families (with or without children) all have backward-
bending labor supply curves, with elasticities rang-ing from −.002 to −.078. Most single-earner heads of households are on the upward-sloping portion of the labor supply curve, with the largest  elasticity of .106 associated with single women with chil-
dren. Married women (listed as spouses of heads of households) are also on the backward-bending portion of the labor supply curve, with elasticities of −.028 and −.086.CHAPTER 14   •  Markets for Factor Inputs  543
of producing its output. For a factor market, economic rent is the difference 
between the payments made to a factor of production and the minimum amount that must be spent to obtain the use of that factor.  Figure 14.11 illustrates the concept 
of economic rent as applied to a competitive labor market. The  equilibrium Wage

LABOR MARKET EQUILIBRIUM
In a competitive labor market in which the output market is competitive, the equilibrium wage wc 
is given by the intersection of the demand for labor (marginal revenue product) curve and the sup-
ply of labor curve. This is point A in part (a) of the figure. Part (b) shows that when the producer has 
 monopoly power, the marginal value of a worker vM is greater than the wage wM. Thus too few workers 
are  employed. (Point B determines the quantity of labor that the firm hires and the wage rate paid.)

ECONOMIC RENT
The economic rent associated with the employ-
ment of labor is the excess of wages paid above the minimum amount needed to hire workers. The equilibrium wage is given by A, at the inter-
section of the labor supply and labor demand curves. Because the supply curve is upward slop-ing, some workers would have accepted jobs for a wage less than w*. The green-shaded area ABw * 
is the economic rent received by all workers.544  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
price of labor is w*, and the quantity of labor supplied is L*. The supply 
of labor curve is the upward-sloping curve, and the demand for labor is the downward-sloping marginal revenue product curve. Because the sup-ply curve tells us how much labor will be supplied at each wage rate, the minimum expenditure needed to employ L* units of labor is given by the 
tan-shaded area AL*0B, below the supply curve to the left of the equilibrium 
labor supply L*.
In perfectly competitive markets, all workers are paid the wage w*. This 
wage is required to get the last “marginal” worker to supply his or her labor, but all other workers earn rents because their wage is greater than the wage that would be needed to get them to work. Because total wage payments are equal to the rectangle 0 w*AL*, the economic rent earned by labor is given by 
the area ABw *.
Note that if the supply curve were perfectly elastic, economic rent would be 
zero. There are rents only when supply is somewhat inelastic. And when supply is perfectly inelastic, all payments to a factor of production are economic rents because the factor will be supplied no matter what price is paid.
As Figure 14.12 shows, one example of an inelastically supplied factor is 
land. The supply curve is perfectly inelastic because land for housing (or for agriculture) is fixed, at least in the short run. With land inelastically supplied, its price is determined entirely by demand. The demand for land is given by D
1, and its price per unit is s1. Total land rent is given by the green-shaded rect-
angle. But when the demand for land increases to D2, the rental value per unit 
of land increases to s2; in this case, total land rent includes the blue-shaded 
area as well. Thus, an increase in the demand for land (a shift to the right in the demand curve) leads both to a higher price per acre and to a higher  economic rent.

LAND RENT
When the supply of land is perfectly inelas-
tic, the market price of land is determined at the point of intersection with the demand curve. The entire value of the land is then an economic rent. When demand is given by D
1, the economic rent per acre is given by 
s1, and when demand increases to D2, rent 
per acre increases to s2.CHAPTER 14   •  Markets for Factor Inputs  545

The U.S. Army had a personnel 
problem for many years. During the Civil War, roughly 90 percent of the armed forces were unskilled work-ers involved in ground combat. Since then, the nature of warfare has evolved. Ground combat forces now make up less than 20 percent of the armed forces. Meanwhile, in the latter half of the 20th century, changes in technology led to shortages in skilled tech-nicians, trained pilots, computer analysts, mechanics, and others needed to operate sophisticated military equipment. How did the military respond to this short-age? Economics provides some answers.
The military pays officers primarily based on years 
of service. Consequently, officers with differing skill levels and abilities were usually paid similar salaries. Moreover, some skilled officers were substantially underpaid relative to salaries they could receive in the private sector. Figure 14.13 shows the inef-ficiency that resulted from this pay policy. The equi-librium wage rate w* is the wage that equates the 
demand for labor to the supply. With an inflexible wage structure, the military paid a wage w
0, which is 
below the equilibrium wage. At w0, the quantity of labor demanded is greater than 
the quantity supplied, and there is a shortage of skilled workers.
Over the past decade the mil-
itary changed its wage structure to maintain an effective fight-ing force. First, a 2.7 percent  
pay raise went into effect in 2007, followed by a 3.9-percent raise in 2009 and a 3.4-percent 
raise in 2010. Even so, military pay remains low: As of 2011, a private first-class earned $20,470, a sergeant $24,736, a captain $43,927, and a major $49,964.
4 However, the military went a step further, 
increasing the number and size of its reenlistment bonuses. Selective reenlistment bonuses were tar-geted at skilled jobs where there were shortages. The military also took advantage of the sustained high unemployment rates in the United States from 2008 to 2011 by emphasizing the substantial tech-nical training that it provided, along with free or subsidized housing, food, medical care, and educa-tion. The result of these policies was to move the market for skilled labor in the military back toward the equilibrium market-clear wage w* depicted in 
Figure 14.13.

14.3   Factor Markets with Monopsony 
Power
In some factor markets, individual buyers have buyer power  that allows them 
to affect the prices they pay. Often this happens either when one firm is a mon-opsony buyer or there are only a few buyers, in which case each firm has some monopsony power. For example, we saw in Chapter 10 that automobile com-panies have monopsony power as buyers of parts and components. GM and Toyota, for example, buy large quantities of brakes, radiators, and other parts and can negotiate lower prices than those charged smaller purchasers. In other cases, there might be only two or three sellers of a factor and a dozen or more buyers, but each buyer nonetheless has bargaining power —it can negotiate low 
prices because it makes large and infrequent purchases and can play the sellers off against each other when bargaining over price.
Throughout this section, we will assume that the output market is perfectly 
competitive. In addition, because a single buyer is easier to visualize than sev-eral buyers who all have some monopsony power, we will restrict our attention at first to pure monopsony.
Monopsony Power: Marginal and Average Expenditure
When you are deciding how much of a good to purchase, you keep increasing the number of units purchased until the additional value from the last unit pur-chased—the marginal value —is just equal to the cost of that unit—the marginal 
expenditure . In perfect competition, the price that you pay for the good—the 
average expenditure —is equal to the marginal expenditure. However, when you 
have monopsony power, the marginal expenditure is greater than the average expenditure, as Figure 14.14 shows.In §10.5, we explain that a 
buyer has monopsony power when his purchasing deci-sion can affect the price of the product.
In §10.5, we explain that marginal expenditure is the cost of one more unit, and average expenditure is the average price paid per unit.

MARGINAL AND AVERAGE  
EXPENDITURE
When the buyer of an input has monopsony 
power, the marginal expenditure curve lies above the average expenditure curve because the decision to buy an extra unit raises the price that must be paid for all units, not just for the last one. The number of units of input purchased is given by L*, at the intersection of the marginal 
revenue product and marginal expenditure curves. The corresponding wage rate w* is lower 
than the competitive wage w
c.CHAPTER 14   •  Markets for Factor Inputs  547
The factor supply curve facing the monopsonist is the market supply curve, 
which shows how much of the factor suppliers are willing to sell as its price increases. Because the monopsonist pays the same price for each unit, the supply curve is its average expenditure curve . The average expenditure curve is upward 
sloping because the decision to buy an extra unit raises the price that must be paid for all units, not just the last one. For a profit-maximizing firm, however, the marginal expenditure curve  is relevant in deciding how much to buy. The mar-
ginal expenditure curve lies above the average expenditure curve: When the firm increases the price of the factor to hire more units, it must pay all units that 
higher price, not just the last unit hired.
Purchasing Decisions with Monopsony Power
How much of the input should the firm buy? As we saw earlier, it should buy up to the point where marginal expenditure equals marginal revenue product. Here the benefit from the last unit bought (MRP) is just equal to the cost (ME). Figure 14.14 illustrates this principle for a labor market. Note that the monop-sonist hires L* units of labor; at that point, ME = MRP
L. The wage rate w* that 
workers are paid is given by finding the point on the average expenditure or supply curve with L* units of labor.
As we showed in Chapter 10, a buyer with monopsony power maximizes 
net benefit (utility less expenditure) from a purchase by buying up to the point where marginal value (MV) is equal to marginal expenditure:
MV=ME
For a firm buying a factor input, MV is just the marginal revenue product of the 
factor MRP . Thus, we have (as in the case of a competitive factor market)
 ME =MRP (14.7)
Note from Figure 14.14 that the monopsonist hires less labor than a firm or 
group of firms with no monopsony power. In a competitive labor market, L
C 
workers would be hired: At that level, the quantity of labor demanded (given by the marginal revenue product curve) is equal to the quantity of labor supplied (given by the average expenditure curve). Note also that the monopsonistic firm will be paying its workers a wage w* that is less than the wage w
C that would be 
paid in a competitive market.
Monopsony power can arise in different ways. One source can be the special-
ized nature of a firm’s business. If the firm buys a component that no one else buys, it is likely to be a monopsonist in the market for that component. Another source can be a business’s location—it may be the only major employer within an area. Monopsony power can also arise when the buyers of a factor form a car-tel to limit purchases of the factor, in order to buy it at less than the competitive price. (But as we explained in Chapter 10, this is a violation of the antitrust laws.)
Few firms in our economy are pure monopsonists. But many firms (or indi-
viduals) have some monopsony power because their purchases account for a large portion of the market. The government is a monopsonist when it hires vol-unteer soldiers or buys missiles, aircraft, and other specialized military equip-ment. A mining firm or other company that is the only major employer in a community also has monopsony power in the local labor market. Even in these 548  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
cases, however, monopsony power may be limited because the government 
competes to some extent with other firms that offer similar jobs. Likewise, the mining firm competes to some extent with companies in nearby communities.
Bargaining Power
In some factor markets, there are a small number of sellers and a small number of buyers. In such cases, an individual buyer and an individual seller will nego-tiate with each other to determine a price. The resulting price might be high or low, depending on which side has more bargaining power.
The amount of bargaining power that a buyer or seller has is determined in 
part by the number of competing buyers and competing sellers. But it is also determined by the nature of the purchase itself. If each buyer makes large and infrequent purchases, it can sometimes play the sellers off against each other when negotiating a price and thereby amass considerable bargaining power.
An example of this kind of bargaining power occurs in the market for commer-
cial aircraft. Airplanes are clearly key factor inputs for airlines, and airlines want to buy planes at the lowest possible prices. There are dozens of airlines, however, and only two major producers of commercial aircraft—Boeing and Airbus. One might think that as a result, Boeing and Airbus would have a considerable advantage when negotiating prices. The opposite is true. It is important to understand why.
Airlines do not buy planes every day, and they do not usually buy one plane 
at a time. A company like American Airlines will typically order new planes only every three or four years, and each order might be for 20 or 30 planes, at a cost of several billion dollars. As big as Boeing and Airbus are, this is no small purchase, and each seller will do all it can to win the order. American Airlines knows this and can use it to its advantage. If, for example, American is choosing between 20 new Boeing 787s or 20 new Airbus A380s (which are similar airplanes), it can play the two companies off against each other when negotiating a price. Thus if Boeing offers a price of, say, $300 million per plane, American might go to Airbus and ask it to do better. Whatever Airbus offers, American will then go back to Boeing and demand a bigger discount, claiming (truthfully or otherwise) that Airbus is offer-ing large discounts. Then back to Airbus, back to Boeing, and so on, until American has succeeded in obtaining a large discount from one of the two companies.
EXAMPLE 14.4   MONOPSONY POWER IN THE MARKET FOR 
BASEBALL PLAYERS
In the United States, major 
league baseball is exempt from the antitrust laws, the result of a Supreme Court decision and the policy of Congress not to apply those laws to labor markets.
5 This 
exemption allowed baseball team owners (before 1975) to oper-ate a  monopsonistic cartel. Like 
all cartels, this one depended on an agreement among own-ers. The agreement involved an annual draft of players and a reserve clause  that effectively 
tied each player to one team for life, thereby eliminating 
5This example builds on an analysis of the structure of baseball players’ salaries by Roger Noll, who 
has kindly supplied us with the relevant data.CHAPTER 14   •  Markets for Factor Inputs  549
most  interteam competition for players. Once a 
player was drafted by a team, he could not play for another team unless rights were sold to that team. As a result, baseball owners had monopsony power in negotiating new contracts with their play-ers: The only alternative to signing an agreement was to give up the game or play it outside the  
United States.
During the 1960s and early 1970s, baseball 
players’ salaries were far below the market value of their marginal products (determined in part by the incremental attention that better hitting or pitching might achieve). For example, if the play-ers’ market had been perfectly competitive, those players receiving a salary of about $42,000 in 1969 would have instead received a salary of $300,000 in 1969 dollars (which is $1.7 million in year 2007 dollars).
Fortunately for the players, and unfortunately for 
the owners, there was a strike in 1972 followed by a lawsuit by one player (Curt Flood of the St. Louis Cardinals) and an arbitrated labor–management agreement. This process eventually led in 1975 to an agreement by which players could become free agents after playing for a team for six years. The 
reserve clause was no longer in effect, and a highly monopsonistic labor market became much more competitive.
The result was an interesting experiment in labor 
market economics. Between 1975 and 1980, the market for baseball players adjusted to a new post–reserve clause equilibrium. Before 1975, expendi-tures on players’ contracts made up approximately 25 percent of all team expenditures. By 1980, those expenditures had increased to 40 percent. Moreover, the average player’s salary doubled in real terms. By 1992, the average baseball player was earning $1,014,942—a very large increase from the monopsonistic wages of the 1960s. In 1969, for example, the average baseball salary was approximately $42,000 adjusted for inflation, about $236,000 in year 2007 dollars.
Salaries for baseball players continued to grow. 
Whereas the average salary was just less than $600,000 in 1990, it had risen to $1,998,000 in 2000 and $3,305,393 by 2011, and many players earned much more. The New York Yankees as a team aver-aged $8,947,937 in 2011.
EXAMPLE 14.5  TEENAGE LABOR MARKETS AND THE MINIMUM WAGE
Increases in the national mini-mum wage rate (which was $4.50 in early 1996 and $7.20 in 2011) were controversial, raising the question of whether the cost of any unemployment that might be generated would be outweighed by the benefit of higher incomes to those whose wages have been increased.
6 A study of the effects 
of the minimum wage on employ-ment in fast-food restaurants in New Jersey added to that contro-versy.
7
Some states have minimum 
wages above the Federal level. In April 1992 the New Jersey minimum wage was increased

(page 328) for an analysis of its effects on employment.

Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania,” American Economic Review  84 (September 1994). See also

Krueger, “A Reanalysis of the Effect of the New Jersey Minimum Wage on the Fast-Food Industry with Representative Payroll Data,” Working Paper No. 6386, Cambridge, MA: National Bureau of Economic Research, 1998; and Madeline Zavodny, “Why Minimum Wage Hikes May Not Reduce Employment,” Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Economic Review, Second Quarter, 1998.550  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour. Using a survey 
of 410 fast-food restaurants, David Card and Alan Krueger found that employment had actu-ally increased  by 13 percent after the minimum 
wage went up. What is the explanation for this surprising result? One possibility is that restau-rants responded to the higher minimum wage by reducing fringe benefits, which usually take the form of free and reduced-price meals for employ-ees. A related explanation is that employers responded by providing less on-the-job training and by lowering the wages for those with experi-ence who had previously been paid more than the new minimum wage.
An alternative explanation for the increased 
New Jersey employment holds that the labor market for teenage (and other) unskilled work-ers is not highly competitive. If so, the analysis of Chapter 9 does not apply. If the unskilled fast-food labor market were monopsonistic, for exam-ple, we would expect a different effect from the increased minimum wage. Suppose that the wage of $4.25 was the wage that fast-food employers with monopsony power in the labor market would offer their workers even if there were no minimum wage. Suppose also that $5.10 would be the wage enjoyed by workers if the labor market were fully competitive. As Figure 14.14 shows, the increase in the minimum wage would not only raise the wage, but would also increase the employment 
level (from L* to L
C).
Does the fast-food study show that employ-
ers have monopsony power in this labor market? The evidence suggests no. If firms do have mon-opsony power but the fast-food market is com-petitive, then the increase in the minimum wage should have no effect on the price of fast food. Because the market for fast food is so competi-tive, firms paying the higher minimum wage would be forced to absorb the higher wage cost them-selves. The study suggests, however, that prices did increase after the introduction of the higher minimum wage.
The Card-Krueger analysis of the minimum 
wage remains hotly debated. A number of crit-ics argued that the New Jersey study was atypi-cal. Others questioned the reliability of the data, arguing that a higher minimum wage reduces employment (see our discussion in Chapter 9).
8 In 
response, Card and Krueger repeated their study, using a more comprehensive and accurate data set. They obtained the same results. Where does this leave us? Perhaps a better characterization of low-wage labor markets requires a more sophisti-cated theory (e.g., the efficiency wage theory dis-cussed in Chapter 17). In any case, new empirical analyses should shed more light on the effects of the minimum wage.
8For example, see Donald Deere, Kevin M. Murply, and Finis Welch, “Employment and the 1990–
1991 Minimum Wage Hike,” American Economic Review, Papers and Proceedings  85 (May 1995): 232–37; 
and David Neumark and William Wascher, “Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania: Comment,” American Economic Review  90 
(2000): 1362–96.In §9.3, we explain that set-
ting a minimum wage in a perfectly competitive market can create unemployment and a deadweight loss.14.4  Factor Markets with Monopoly Power
Just as buyers of inputs can have monopsony power, sellers of inputs can 
have monopoly power. In the extreme, the seller of an input may be a monopolist, as when a firm has a patent to produce a computer chip that no other firm can duplicate. Because the most important example of monop-oly power in factor markets involves labor unions, we will concentrate most of our attention there. In the subsections that follow, we show how a  labor union, which is a monopolist in the sale of labor services, might increase the well-being of its members and substantially affect nonunionized workers.
In §10.2, we explain that a 
seller of a product has some monopoly power if it can profitably charge a price greater than marginal cost.CHAPTER 14   •  Markets for Factor Inputs  551
Monopoly Power over the Wage Rate
Figure 14.15 shows a demand for labor curve in a market with no monopsony 
power: It aggregates the marginal revenue products of firms that compete to buy labor. The labor supply curve describes how union members would supply labor if the union exerted no monopoly power. In that case, the labor market 
would be competitive, and L* workers would be hired at a wage of w*, where 
demand D
L equals supply SL.
Because of its monopoly power, however, the union can choose any wage rate 
and the corresponding quantity of labor supplied, just as a monopolist seller of output chooses price and the corresponding quantity of output. If the union wanted to maximize the number of workers hired, it would choose the com-petitive outcome at A. However, if the union wished to obtain a higher-than-
competitive wage, it could restrict its membership to L
1 workers. As a result, the 
firm would pay a wage rate of w1. Although union members who work would 
be better off, those who cannot find jobs would be worse off.
Is a policy of restrictive union membership worthwhile? If the union wishes 
to maximize the economic rent that its workers receive, the answer is yes. By restricting membership, the union would be acting like a monopolist, which restricts output in order to maximize profit. To a firm, profit is the revenue that it receives less its opportunity costs. To a union, rent represents the wages that its members earn as a group in excess of their opportunity cost. To maximize rent, the union must choose the number of workers hired so that the marginal revenue to the union (the additional wages earned) is equal to the extra cost of inducing workers to work. This cost is a marginal  opportunity cost because it is 
a measure of what an employer has to offer an additional worker to get him or her to work for the firm. However, the wage that is necessary to encourage addi-tional workers to take jobs is given by the supply of labor curve S
L.
The rent-maximizing combination of wage rate and number of workers is given 
by the intersection of the MR and SL curves. We have chosen the wage- employment 
combination of w1 and L1 with the rent-maximization premise in mind. The shaded 
area below the demand for labor curve, above the supply of labor curve and to the left of L
1, represents the economic rent that all workers receive.In §7.1, we explain that 
opportunity cost is the cost associated with opportuni-ties that are foregone by not putting a firm’s resources to their best alternative use.Wage

MONOPOLY POWER OF SELLERS OF LABOR
When a labor union is a monopolist, it chooses among 
points on the buyer’s demand for labor curve DL. The 
seller can maximize the number of workers hired, at L*, by agreeing that workers will work at wage w*. The 
quantity of labor L
1 that maximizes the rent earned by 
employees is determined by the intersection of the marginal revenue and supply of labor curves; union members will receive a wage rate of w
1. Finally, if the 
union wishes to maximize total wages paid to workers, it should allow L
2 union members to be employed at 
a wage rate of w2. At that point, the marginal  revenue 
to the union will be zero.552  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
A rent-maximizing policy might benefit nonunion workers if they can find non-
union jobs. However, if these jobs are not available, rent maximization could cre-ate too sharp a distinction between winners and losers. An alternative objective is to maximize the aggregate wages that all union members receive. Look again at the example in Figure 14.15. To achieve this goal, the number of workers hired is increased from L
1 until the marginal revenue to the union is equal to zero. Because 
any further employment decreases total wage payments, aggregate wages are maximized when the wage is equal to w
2 and the number of workers is equal to L2.
Unionized and Nonunionized Workers
When the union uses its monopoly power to increase members’ wages, fewer 
unionized workers are hired. Because these workers either move to the non-union sector or choose initially not to join the union, it is important to under-stand what happens in the nonunionized part of the economy.
Assume that the total supply of unionized and nonunionized workers is 
fixed. In Figure 14.16, the market supply of labor in both sectors is given by S
L. The demand for labor by firms in the unionized sector is given by DU, the 
demand in the nonunionized sector by DNU. Total market demand is the hori-
zontal sum of the demands in the two sectors and is given by DL.
Suppose the union chooses to increase the wage rate of its workers above the 
competitive wage w*, to wU. At that wage rate, the number of workers hired in 
the unionized sector falls by an amount /H9004LU, as shown on the horizontal axis. 
As these workers find employment in the nonunionized sector, the wage rate in that sector adjusts until the labor market is in equilibrium. At the new wage rate in the nonunionized sector, w
NU, the additional number of workers hired in that 
sector, /H9004LNU, is equal to the number of workers who left the unionized sector.
Figure 14.16 shows an adverse consequence of a union strategy directed 
toward raising union wages: Nonunionized wages fall. Unionization can improve working conditions and provide useful information to workers and management. But when the demand for labor is not perfectly inelastic, union workers are helped at the expense of nonunion workers.

When a monopolistic union raises the wage in the unionized

For the total supply of labor, given by SL, to remain unchanged,

9According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2010, the average union worker in the private  sector 
earned $23.19 per hour in wage and salary income, while the average nonunion worker earned $19.28 per hour.EXAMPLE 14.6  THE DECLINE OF PRIVATE-SECTOR UNIONISM
For several decades, the membership of labor 
unions has been declining. Figure 14.7 shows the decline in union membership over the past thirty years. The decline has been relatively steady, but as we moved into the 21st century the rate of decline began to diminish and it has stabilized in recent years at about 12 percent. Interestingly, this 12 percent average masks huge differences between the public sector, where unionization was 36.2 percent in 2010, and the private sector, where unionization was only 6.9%.
How have unions responded to this impor-
tant dynamic? We might expect that the decline in union bargaining power might lead to differ-ent responses by union negotiators, and this has indeed been the case. Historically, union wages have been higher than the wages of their nonunion counterparts. During the 1970s, the  differential between union and nonunion wages decreased 
substantially as unions focused on employment rather than wages. In the 1980s in response to union demands, the pattern evolved further as employers put into place two-tiered wage provi-sions in which wages for experienced workers were kept high, but newer union members were paid on a lower wage scale.
During the past two decades, a number of eco-
nomic forces have led to a further narrowing of the union-nonunion wage differential, which has remained constant over the past ten years.
9 Why 
did the wage differential decline over time? For one thing, the demand for unionized employees has become increasingly elastic over time as firms have found it easier to substitute capital for skilled labor in the production process. For another, global-ization has meant that many companies were able

to organize their production processes so as to hire 
nonunion labor, either within or outside the United States. Faced with an elastic demand for its services, unions would have little choice but to give ground on wages in order to maintain employment levels. 
Under substantial competitive pressure, they have agreed to maintain a two-tier wage and benefits structure.

American Progress: The Hamilton Project, April, 2010. See also David H. Autor, Lawrence Katz, and Alan B. Krueger, “Computing Inequality: Have Computers Changed the Labor Market?” Quarterly 
Journal of Economics  113 (November 1998): 1169–1213.EXAMPLE 14.7  WAGE INEQUALITY REVISITED
In Example 2.2, we explained how 
the rapid growth in the demand for skilled relative to unskilled labor has been partly responsi-ble for the growing inequality in the distribution of income in the United States. As we explained, while the demand for skilled labor has steadily increased, the sup-ply of skilled labor has not grown much. Instead, it has been the supply of unskilled labor that has grown. What are the reasons for these changes in relative demand and supply? Have the decline in private-sector unionism and the failure of the minimum wage to keep up with inflation been important factors? Or is it the increasing importance of education, along with the role that computers now play in the labor market? A recent study pro-vides some answers.
10
From 1980 through the present, college gradu-
ates’ relative wages have grown. This is not consis-tent with what one would expect if the decline of unionism and/or changes in the minimum wage was the primary reason for the growing inequality. In 1963 the hourly wage of a typical college gradu-ate was 1.5 times that of a high school graduate. By 2009, that ratio had increased to 1.95. By 2010, the median weekly salary of those with a college degree (but no further education) was $1038, whereas those with a high-school degree earned only $626. Moving beyond college to a further professional degree led to a median wage of $1610.
11 The  importance of education is summarized in 
Figure 14.18, which shows (for 2010) median weekly earnings—as well as unemployment rates—for different levels of education. Education clearly pays. Workers with more education not only receive higher salaries, but they are also much less likely to lose their jobs and become unem-
ployed in an economic downturn. For example, in 2010 the average unemployment rate was 5.4% for those with a bachelor’s degree, and 14.9% for those who had not completed high school.
A clue to what happened is given by the 
 dramatic increase in the use of computers by 
workers. In 1984, 25 percent of all workers used computers; that figure is now close to 60 percent, and it is over 80 percent for managers and pro-fessionals.
12 Education and computer use have 
gone hand in hand to increase the demand for skilled workers. A statistical analysis shows that, 
overall, the spread of computer technology is responsible for nearly half the increase in relative wages. Furthermore, the growth in the demand for skilled workers has occurred primarily within industries where computers have become increasingly useful.
These data, along with the numbers shown in 
Figure 14.18, should motivate you to continue your college and graduate studies—especially your study of microeconomics.

SUMMARY
 1. In a competitive input market, the demand for an 
input is given by the marginal revenue product, the product of the firm’s marginal revenue, and the mar-ginal product of the input.
 2. A firm in a competitive labor market will hire workers 
to the point at which the marginal revenue product of labor is equal to the wage rate. This principle is analo-gous to the profit-maximizing output condition that production be increased to the point at which marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost.
 3. The market demand for an input is the horizontal 
sum of industry demands for the input. But industry demand is not the horizontal sum of the demands of all the firms in the industry. To determine industry demand, one must remember that the market price of the product will change in response to changes in the price of an input.
 4. When factor markets are competitive, the buyer of an 
input assumes that its purchases will have no effect on its price. As a result, the firm’s marginal expenditure and average expenditure curves are both perfectly elastic. 5. The market supply of a factor such as labor need not 
be upward sloping. A backward-bending labor supply curve can result if the income effect associated with a higher wage rate (more leisure is demanded because it is a normal good) is greater than the substitution effect (less leisure is demanded because its price has  
gone up).
 6. Economic rent is the difference between the payments 
to factors of production and the minimum payment that would be needed to employ them. In a labor mar-ket, rent is measured by the area below the wage level and above the marginal expenditure curve.
 7. When a buyer of an input has monopsony power, 
the marginal expenditure curve lies above the aver-age expenditure curve, which reflects the fact that the monopsonist must pay a higher price to attract more of the input into employment.
 8. When the input seller is a monopolist, such as a labor 
union, the seller chooses the point on the marginal revenue product curve that best suits its objective. Maximization of employment, economic rent, and wages are three plausible objectives for labor unions.556  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW
 1. Why is a firm’s demand for labor curve more inelastic 
when the firm has monopoly power in the output mar-ket than when the firm is producing competitively?
 2. Why might a labor supply curve be backward bending?
 3. How is a computer company’s demand for computer 
programmers a derived demand?
 4. Compare the hiring choices of a monopsonistic and 
a competitive employer of workers. Which will hire more workers, and which will pay the higher wage? Explain.
 5. Rock musicians sometimes earn several million dollars 
per year. Can you explain such large incomes in terms of economic rent?
 6. What happens to the demand for one input when the 
use of a complementary input increases?
 7. For a monopsonist, what is the relationship between 
the supply of an input and the marginal expenditure on it?
 8. Currently the National Football League has a system 
for drafting college players by which each player is picked by only one team. The player must sign with that team or not play in the league. What would hap-pen to the wages of both newly drafted and more experienced football players if the draft system were 
repealed and all teams could compete for college  players?
 9. The government wants to encourage individuals on 
welfare to become employed. It is considering two possible incentive programs:
 a. Give firms $2 per hour for every individual on wel-
fare who is hired.
 b. Give each firm that hires one or more welfare work-
ers a payment of $1000 per year, irrespective of the number of hires.
To what extent is each of these programs likely to be effective at increasing the employment opportunities for welfare workers?
 10. A small specialty cookie company, whose only vari-
able input is labor, finds that the average worker can produce 50 cookies per day, the cost of the average worker is $64 per day, and the price of a cookie is $1. Is the company maximizing its profit? Explain.
 11. A firm uses both labor and machines in production. 
Explain why an increase in the average wage rate causes both a movement along the labor demand curve and a shift of the curve.

In Chapter 14, we saw that in competitive markets, firms decide 
how much to purchase each month by comparing the marginal  revenue product of each factor to its cost. The decisions of all firms 
determine the market demand for each factor, and the market price is the price that equates the quantity demanded with the quantity sup-plied. For factor inputs such as labor and raw materials, this picture is reasonably complete, but not so for capital. The reason is that capital is durable : It can last and contribute to production for years after it is 
purchased.
Firms sometimes rent capital in much the same way that they hire 
workers. For example, a firm might rent office space for a monthly fee, just as it hires a worker for a monthly wage. But more often, capital expenditures involve the purchases of factories and equipment that are expected to last for years. This introduces the element of time. When a 
firm decides whether to build a factory or purchase machines, it must compare the outlays it would have to make now with the additional 
profit that the new capital will generate in the future . To make this com-
parison, it must address the following question: How much are future 
profits worth today?  This problem does not arise when hiring labor or 
purchasing raw materials. To make those choices, the firm need only compare its current  expenditure on the factor—e.g., the wage or the 
price of steel—with the factor’s current  marginal revenue product.
In this chapter, we will learn how to calculate the current value 
of future flows of money. This is the basis for our study of the firm’s investment decisions. Most of these decisions involve comparing an outlay today with profits that will be received in the future; we will see how firms can make this comparison and determine whether the outlay is warranted. Often, the future profits resulting from a capital investment are higher or lower than anticipated. We will see how firms can take this kind of uncertainty into account.
Individuals also make decisions involving costs and benefits occur-
ring at different points in time, and the same principles apply. For example, we will see how a consumer choosing a new air conditioner can determine whether it makes economic sense to buy a more energy-efficient model that costs more but will result in lower electricity bills in the future. We will also discuss investments in human capital . Does it 
make economic sense, for example, to go to college or graduate school rather than take a job and start earning an income?15.1

We will examine other intertemporal decisions that firms sometimes face. For 
example, producing a depletable resource, such as natural gas or oil, means that less will be available to produce in the future. How should a producer take this into account? How long should a timber company let trees grow before harvest-ing them for lumber?
The answers to these investment and production decisions depend in 
part on the interest rate  that one pays or receives when borrowing or lending 
money. We will discuss the factors that determine interest rates and explain why interest rates on government bonds, corporate bonds, and savings accounts differ.
15.1  Stocks versus Flows
Before proceeding, we must be clear about how to measure capital and other factor inputs that firms purchase. Capital is measured as a stock , i.e., 
as a quantity of plant and equipment that the firm owns. For example, if a firm owns an electric motor factory worth $10 million, we say that it has a capital stock  worth $10 million. Inputs of labor and raw materials, on the 
other hand, are measured as flows . The output of the firm is also a flow. For 
example, this same firm might use 20,000 worker-hours of labor and 20,000 pounds of copper per month  to produce 8000 electric motors per month . (The 
choice of monthly units is arbitrary; we could just as well have expressed these quantities in weekly or annual terms—for example, 240,000 worker- hours of labor per year, 240,000 pounds of copper per year, and 96,000 motors per year.)
Let’s look at this producer of electric motors in more detail. Both variable cost 
and the rate of output are flows. Suppose the wage rate is $15 per hour and the price of copper is $2.00 per pound. Thus the variable cost is (20,000)($15) + 
(20,000)($2.00) =$340,000 per month . Average variable cost, on the other hand, is a 
cost per unit :
$340,000
 per month
8000  units per month =$42.50  per unit
Suppose the firm sells its motors for $52.50 each. Then its average profit 
is $52.50 -$42.50 =$10.00 per unit, and its total profit is $80,000 per month . 
(Note that total profit is also a flow.) To make and sell these motors, how-ever, the firm needs capital—namely, the factory that it built for $10 million. Thus the firm’s $10 million capital stock allows it to earn a flow of profit of $80,000 per month .
Was the $10 million investment in this factory a sound decision? To answer 
this question, we must translate the $80,000 per month profit flow into a number that we can compare with the factory’s $10 million cost. Suppose the factory is expected to last for 20 years. In that case the problem, simply put, is: What is the value today of $80,000 per month for the next 20 years? If that value is greater than $10 million, the investment was a good one.
A profit of $80,000 per month for 20 years comes to ($80,000)(20)(12) =
$19.2 million. That would make the factory seem like an excellent investment. But is $80,000 five years—or 20 years—from now worth $80,000 today? No, because money today can be invested—in a bank account, a bond, or other interest-bearing In §14.1, we explain that in 
a competitive factor market, the demand for each fac-
tor is given by its marginal 
revenue product—i.e., the additional revenue earned from an incremental unit of the factor.
Recall from §6.1 that a firm’s production function involves flows of inputs and outputs: It turns certain amounts of labor and capital each year into an amount of output that same year.CHAPTER 15   •  Investment, Time, and Capital Markets  561
assets—to yield more money in the future. As a result, $19.2 million received over 
the next 20 years is worth less than $19.2 million today.
15.2  Present Discounted Value
We will return to our $10 million electric motor factory in Section 15.4, but first 
we must address a basic problem: How much is $1 paid in the future worth today?  
The answer depends on the interest rate:  the rate at which one can borrow or 
lend money.
Suppose the annual interest rate is R. (Don’t worry about which interest rate 
this actually is; later, we’ll discuss the various types of interest rates.) Then $1 today can be invested to yield (1 +R) dollars a year from now. Therefore, 1 +
R dollars is the future value  of $1 today. Now, what is the value today , i.e., the 
present discounted value (PDV),  of $1 paid one year from now? The answer is 
easy: because 1 +R dollars one year from now is worth (1 +R)/(1 +R)=$1 
today, $1 a year from now is worth  $1/(1 +R) today . This is the amount of money 
that will yield $1 after one year if invested at the rate R.
What is the value today of $1 paid two years from now? If $1 were invested 
today at the interest rate R, it would be worth 1 +R dollars after one year, 
and (1 +R)(1
+R)=(1+R)2 dollars at the end of two years. Because 
(1+R)2 dollars two years from now is worth $1 today, $1 two years from now 
is worth $1/(1 +R)2 today. Similarly, $1 paid three years from now is worth 
$1/(1 +R)3 today, and $1 paid n years from now is worth $1/(1 +R)n today.1
We can summarize this as follows:
PDV  of $1  paid after  1 year= $1
(1+R)
PDV  of $1  paid after  2 years = $1
(1+R)2
PDV  of $1  paid after  3 years = $1
(1+R)3
f
PDV  of $1  paid after  n years = $1
(1+R)n
Table 15.1 shows, for different interest rates, the present value of $1 paid after 
1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 years. Note that for interest rates above 6 or 7 percent, $1 paid 20 or 30 years from now is worth very little today. But this is not the case for low interest rates. For example, if R is 3 percent, the PDV of $1 paid 20 years 
from now is about 55 cents. In other words, if 55 cents were invested now at the rate of 3 percent, it would yield about $1 after 20 years.• interest rate  Rate at which 
one can borrow or lend money.
• present discounted value 
(PDV)  The current value of an 
expected future cash flow.
1We are assuming that the annual rate of interest R is constant from year to year. Suppose the annual 
interest rate were expected to change, so that R1 is the rate in year 1, R2 is the rate in year 2, and 
so forth. After two years, $1 invested today would be worth (1 + R1)(1 + R2), so that the PDV of $1 
received two years from now is $1/(1 + R1)(1 + R2). Similarly, the PDV of $1 paid n years from now 
is $1/(1 + R1)(1 + R2)(1 + R3)…(1 + Rn).562  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
Valuing Payment Streams
We can now determine the present value of a stream of payments over time. 
For example, consider the two payment streams in Table 15.2. Stream A comes 
to $200: $100 paid now and $100 a year from now. Stream B comes to $220: $20 
paid now, $100 a year from now, and $100 two years from now. Which payment stream would you prefer to receive? The answer depends on the interest rate.
To calculate the present discounted value of these two streams, we compute 
and add the present values of each year’s payment:
PDV of Stream
 A=$100 + $100
(1+R)
PDV of Stream B=$20 + $100
(1+R) + $100
(1+R)2
Table 15.3 shows the present values of the two streams for interest rates of 5, 
10, 15, and 20 percent. As the table shows, the preferred stream depends on the interest rate. For interest rates of 10 percent or less, Stream B is worth more; for 
interest rates of 15 percent or more, Stream A is worth more. Why? Because even 
though less is paid out in Stream A, it is paid out sooner.TABLE 15.1 PDV OF $1 PAID IN THE FUTURE

This simple example shown in Tables 15.2 and 15.3 illustrates an important 
principle. The present value of a stream of payments depends on three things: (1) the amount of each payment, (2) the timing of the payments, and (3) the interest rate used to discount payments made in the future. As we will see, this principle applies to a wide variety of problems.TABLE 15.3 PDV OF PAYMENT STREAMS

EXAMPLE 15.1  THE VALUE OF LOST EARNINGS
In legal cases involving accidents, victims or their heirs (if the victim is killed) 
sue the injuring party (or an insurance company) to recover damages. In addition to compensating for pain and suffering, those damages include the future income that the injured or deceased person would have earned had the accident not occurred. To see how the present value of lost earnings can be calculated, let’s examine an actual 1996 accident case. (The names and some of the data have been changed to preserve anonymity.)
Harold Jennings died in an automobile accident on January 1, 1996, at 
the age of 53. His family sued the driver of the other car for negligence. A major part of the damages they asked to be awarded was the present value of the earnings that Jennings would have received from his job as an airline pilot had he not been killed. The calculation of present value is typical of cases like this.
Had he worked in 1996, Jennings’ salary would have been $85,000. The 
normal age of retirement for an airline pilot is 60. To calculate the present value of Jennings’ lost earnings, we must take several things into account. First, Jennings’ salary would probably have increased over the years. Second, we cannot be sure that he would have lived to retirement had the accident not occurred; he might have died from some other cause. Therefore, the PDV of his lost earnings until retirement at the end of 2003 is
PDV=W
0+ W0(1+g)(1-m1)
(1+R) + W0(1+g)2(1-m2)
(1+R)2
+g + W0(1+g)7(1-m7)
(1+R)7
where W0 is his salary in 1996, g is the annual percentage rate at which his 
salary is likely to have grown (so that W0(1 + g) would be his salary in 1997, 
W0(1 + g)2 his salary in 1998, etc.), and m1, m2,…, m7 are mortality rates , i.e., 564  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
15.3  The Value of a Bond
A bond  is a contract in which a borrower agrees to pay the bondholder (the 
lender) a stream of money. For example, a corporate bond (a bond issued by a corporation) might make “coupon” payments of $100 per year for the next ten years, and then a principal payment of $1000 at the end of the  ten-year period.

Edition).TABLE 15.4 CALCULATING LOST WAGES

3Actually, this sum should be reduced by the amount of Jennings’ wages which would have 
been spent on his own consumption and which would not therefore have benefited his wife or children.the probabilities that he would have died from some other cause by 1997, 
1998,…, 2003.
To calculate this PDV, we need to know the mortality rates m1,…, m7, 
the expected rate of growth of Jennings’ salary g, and the interest rate R. 
Mortality data are available from insurance tables that provide death rates for men of similar age and race.
2 As a value for g, we can use 8 percent, 
the average rate of growth of wages for airline pilots over the period 1985–1995. Finally, for the interest rate we can use the rate on govern-ment bonds, which at the time was about 9 percent. (We will say more about how one chooses the correct interest rate to discount future cash flows in Sections 15.4 and 15.5.) Table 15.4 shows the details of the pres-ent value calculation.
By summing the last column, we obtain a PDV of $650,254. If Jennings’ 
family was successful in proving that the defendant was at fault, and if there were no other damage issues involved in the case, they could recover this amount as compensation.

ments. To keep the arithmetic simple, we will assume that they are made annually.CHAPTER 15   •  Investment, Time, and Capital Markets  565
the bond is worth, we simply compute the present value of the payment 
stream:
 PDV = $100
(1+R) + $100
(1+R)2 +g + $100
(1+R)10 + $1000
(1+R)10 (15.1)
Again, the present value depends on the interest rate. Figure 15.1 shows the 
value of the bond—the present value of its payment stream—for interest rates up to 20 percent. Note that the higher the interest rate, the lower the value of the bond. At an interest rate of 5 percent, the bond is worth about $1386, but at an interest rate of 15 percent, its value is only $749.
Perpetuities
A perpetuity  is a bond that pays out a fixed amount of money each year, forever . 
How much is a perpetuity that pays $100 per year worth? The present value of the payment stream is given by the infinite summation:
PDV = $100
(1+R) + $100
(1+R)2 + $100

PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOW FROM A BOND
Because most of the bond’s payments occur in the future, the present discounted 
value declines as the interest rate increases. For example, if the interest rate is 5 percent, the PDV of a 10-year bond paying $100 per year on a principal of $1000 is $1386. At an interest rate of 15 percent, the PDV is $749.566  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
Fortunately, it isn’t necessary to calculate and add up all these terms to find 
the value of this perpetuity; the summation can be expressed in terms of a sim-ple formula.

 PDV =$100/ R (15.2)
So if the interest rate is 5 percent, the perpetuity is worth $100/(.05) = $2000, but 
if the interest rate is 20 percent, the perpetuity is worth only $500.
The Effective Yield on a Bond
Many corporate and most government bonds are traded on the bond market . 
The value of a traded bond can be determined directly by looking at its market price—the value placed on it by buyers and sellers.
6 Thus we usually know the 
value of a bond, but to compare the bond with other investment opportunities, we would like to determine the interest rate consistent with that value.
EFFECTIVE YIELD  Equations (15.1) and (15.2) show how the values of two 
different bonds depend on the interest rate used to discount future payments. These equations can be “turned around” to relate the interest rate to the bond’s value. This is particularly easy to do for the perpetuity. Suppose the market price—and thus the value—of the perpetuity is P. Then from equation (15.2), 
P = $100/ R, and R = $100/ P. Thus, if the price of the perpetuity is $1000, we 
know that the interest rate is R = $100/$1000 = 0.10, or 10 percent. This interest 
rate is called the effective yield, or rate of return:  the percentage return that one 
receives by investing in a bond.
For the ten-year coupon bond in equation (15.1), calculating the effective yield 
is a bit more complicated. If the price of the bond is P, we write equation (15.1) as
P= $100
(1+R) + $100
(1+R)2 + $100
(1+R)3 +g + $100
(1+R)10 + $1000
(1+R)10
Given the price P, this equation must be solved for R. Although there is 
no simple formula to express R in terms of P in this case, there are methods 
(sometimes available on calculators and spreadsheet programs such as Excel) for calculating R numerically. Figure 15.2, which plots the same curve as that 
in Figure 15.1, shows how R depends on P for this ten-year coupon bond. Note 
that if the price of the bond is $1000, the effective yield is 10 percent. If the price rises to $1300, the effective yield drops to about 6 percent. If the price falls to $700, the effective yield rises to over 16 percent.
Yields can differ considerably among different bonds. Corporate bonds gen-
erally yield more than government bonds, and as Example 15.2 shows, the bonds of some corporations yield much more than the bonds of others. One of the most important reasons for this is that different bonds carry different degrees of risk. The U.S. government is less likely to default  (fail to make interest or principal • effective yield ( or rate of

EFFECTIVE YIELD ON A BOND
The effective yield is the interest rate that equates the present value of the 
bond’s payment stream with the bond’s market price. The figure shows the pres-ent value of the payment stream as a function of the interest rate. The effective yield is found by drawing a horizontal line at the level of the bond’s price. For example, if the price of this bond were $1000, its effective yield would be 10 percent. If the price were $1300, the effective yield would be about 6 percent; if the price were $700, it would be 16.2 percent.
EXAMPLE 15.2  THE YIELDS ON CORPORATE BONDS
To see how corporate bond yields are calculated—and how they can dif-
fer from one corporation to another—let’s examine the yields for two cou-pon bonds: one issued by Microsoft and the other by the drug store chain Rite Aid. Each has a face value  of $100, which means that when the bond 
matures, the holder receives a principal payment of that amount. Each bond makes a “coupon” (i.e., interest) payment every six months.
7
7These bonds actually have a face value of $1000, not $100. The prices and coupon payments are 
listed as though the face value were $100; to get the actual prices and payments, just multiply by 10 the numbers that appear on financial Web sites or in the newspaper.payments) on its bonds than is a private corporation. And some corporations 
are financially stronger and therefore less likely to default than others. As we saw in Chapter 5, the more risky an investment, the greater the return that an investor demands. As a result, riskier bonds have higher yields.568  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
We calculate the bond yields using the closing prices on August 1, 2011. 
The following information was downloaded from the Yahoo! Finance Web site:
Microsoft Rite Aid
Price ($): 106.60 93.00Coupon ($): 5.300 9.500Maturity Date: Feb. 8, 2041 Jun. 15, 2017Yield to Maturity (%): 4.877 11.099Current Yield (%): 4.972 10.215Rating: AAA CCC
What do these numbers mean? For Microsoft, the price of $106.60 
was the closing price on August 1, 2011, based on a face value for the bond of $100. The coupon of $5.30 means that $2.65 is paid to the owner of the bond every six months. The maturity date is the date at which the bond comes due and the owner receives the $100 face value. The  
4.877 percent yield to maturity, discussed further below, is the effective yield (i.e., rate of return) on the bond. The current yield is simply the cou-pon divided by the price, i.e., 5.300/106.60 = 4.972 percent. (The current yield is of limited relevance because it doesn’t tell us the actual rate of return on the bond.) Finally, the Microsoft bond is rated AAA, which is the highest rating possible for a corporate bond, indicating that the likeli-hood of default is very low.
How does one determine the effective yield (i.e., rate of return, or yield 
to maturity) on this bond? For simplicity, we’ll assume that the coupon pay-ments are made annually instead of every six months. (The error that this introduces is small.) Because the Microsoft bond matures in 2041, coupon payments will be made for 2041 – 2011 = 30 years. Thus the yield is given by the following equation:
8Solving the equation for R can be done in Excel by using Solver.106.60 =  5.3
(1+R) +  5.3
(1+R)2  +  5.3
(1+R)3 +g+  5.3
(1+R)29 +  5.3
(1+R)30
To find the effective yield, we must solve this equation for R.8 You can check 
(by substituting to see whether the equation is satisfied) that the solution is approximately R* = 4.877 percent.
The effective yield on the Rite Aid bond is found the same way. The bond 
had a price of $93.00, made coupon payments of $9.50 per year, and had 2017 – 2011 = 6 years to mature. Thus the equation for its yield is:
93.00 =
  9.5
(1+R) +  9.5
(1+R)2  +  9.5
(1+R)3 + 9.5
(1+R)4 +  9.5

15.4   The Net Present Value Criterion for 
Capital Investment Decisions
One of the most common and important decisions that firms make is to invest 
in new capital. Millions of dollars may be invested in a factory or machines that will last—and affect profits—for many years. The future cash flows that the investment will generate are often uncertain. And once the factory has been built, the firm usually cannot disassemble and resell it to recoup its invest-ment—it becomes a sunk cost.
How should a firm decide whether a particular capital investment is worth-
while? It should calculate the present value of the future cash flows that it expects to receive from the investment and compare it with the cost of the investment. This method is known as the net present value (NPV) criterion:
NPV criterion: Invest if the present value of the expected future cash flows 
from an investment is larger than the cost of the investment.
Suppose a capital investment costs C and is expected to generate profits over the 
next 10 years of amounts p
1, p2,…, p10. We then write the net present value as
 NPV =-C+ p1
(1+R) + p2
(1+R)2 +g+ p10
(1+R)10 (15.3)
where R is the discount rate  that we use to discount the future stream of prof-
its. ( R might be a market interest rate or some other rate; we will discuss how 
to choose it shortly.) Equation (15.3) describes the net benefit to the firm from the investment. The firm should make the investment only if that net benefit is positive—i.e., only if NPV  > 0.
DETERMINING THE DISCOUNT RATE  What discount rate should the firm 
use? The answer depends on the alternative ways that the firm could use its money. For example, instead of this investment, the firm might invest In §7.1, we explain that a 
sunk cost is an expenditure that has been made and cannot be recovered.
• net present value (NPV)

 Rule holding that one 
should invest if the present value of the expected future cash flow from an investment is larger than the cost of the investment.
• discount rate  Rate used to 
determine the value today of a dollar received in the future.The solution to this equation is R* = 11.099 percent.
Why was the yield on the Rite Aid bond so much higher than on the Microsoft 
bond? Because the Rite Aid bond was much riskier. By 2011, the drug store chain was suffering large losses due to increasing competition from larger chains like Wal-Mart, which were able to use their scale to undercut prices on everything from toiletries to prescription drugs. Between 2007 and 2011, Rite Aid turned a profit for only one quarter, leading many analysts to predict bank-ruptcy. Consistent with this, Rite Aid’s bond was rated CCC (the lowest rank-ing). Because investors knew that there was a significant possibility that Rite Aid would default on its bond payments, they were prepared to buy the bond only if the expected return was high enough to compensate them for the risk.570  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
in another piece of capital that generates a different stream of profits. Or it 
might invest in a bond that yields a different return. As a result, we can think of R as the firm’s opportunity cost of capital.  Had the firm not invested in 
this project, it could have earned a return by investing in something else. The 
correct value for  R is therefore the return that the firm could earn on a “similar” 
investment .
By “similar” investment, we mean one with the same risk. As we saw in 
Chapter 5, the more risky an investment, the greater the return one expects to receive from it. Therefore, the opportunity cost of investing in this proj-ect is the return that one could earn from another project or asset of similar  riskiness.
We’ll see how to evaluate the riskiness of an investment in the next sec-
tion. For now, let’s assume that this project has no risk  (i.e., the firm is sure 
that the future profit flows will be p
1, p2, etc.). In that case, the opportunity 
cost of the investment is the risk-free  return—e.g., the return one could earn 
on a government bond. If the project is expected to last for 10 years, the firm could use the annual interest rate on a 10-year government bond to com-pute the NPV of the project, as in equation (15.3).
9 If the NPV is zero, the 
benefit from the investment would just equal the opportunity cost, so the firm should be indifferent between investing and not investing. If the NPV is greater than zero, the benefit exceeds the opportunity cost, so the investment should be made.

The Electric Motor Factory
In Section 15.1, we discussed a decision to invest $10 million in a factory to pro-duce electric motors. This factory would enable the firm to use labor and cop-per to produce 8000 motors per month for 20 years at a cost of $42.50 each. The motors could be sold for $52.50 each, for a profit of $10 per unit, or $80,000 per month. We will assume that after 20 years, the factory will be obsolete but can be sold for scrap for $1 million. Is this a good investment? To find out, we must calculate its net present value.
We will assume for now that the $42.50 production cost and the $52.50 price 
at which the motors can be sold are certain, so that the firm is sure that it will receive $80,000 per month, or $960,000 per year, in profit. We also assume that the $1 million scrap value of the factory is certain. The firm should therefore use a risk-free interest rate to discount future profits. Writing the cash flows in mil-lions of dollars, the NPV is
 NPV =-10+ .96
(1+R) + .96
(1+R)2 + .96

+c + .96
(1+R)20 + 1
(1+R)20• opportunity cost of 
capital  Rate of return that one 
could earn by investing in an alternate project with similar risk.
9This is an approximation. To be precise, the firm should use the rate on a one-year bond to discount 
p1, the rate on a two-year bond to discount p2, etc.
10This NPV rule is incorrect when the investment is irreversible, subject to uncertainty, and can 
be delayed. For a treatment of irreversible investment, see Avinash Dixit and Robert Pindyck, Investment under Uncertainty  (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1994).CHAPTER 15   •  Investment, Time, and Capital Markets  571
Figure 15.3 shows the NPV as a function of the discount rate R. Note that 
at the rate R*, which is about 7.5 percent, the NPV is equal to zero. (The rate 
R* is sometimes referred to as the internal rate of return  on the investment.) For 
 discount rates below 7.5 percent, the NPV is positive, so the firm should invest in the factory. For discount rates above 7.5 percent, the NPV is negative, and the firm should not invest.
Real versus Nominal Discount Rates
In the example above, we assumed that future cash flows are certain, so that the discount rate R should be a risk-free interest rate, such as the rate on U.S. gov-
ernment bonds. Suppose that rate happened to be 9 percent. Does that mean the NPV is negative and the firm should not invest?
To answer this question, we must distinguish between real and nominal dis-
count rates, and between real and nominal cash flows. Let’s begin with the cash flows. In Chapter 1, we discussed real versus nominal prices. We explained that whereas the real price is net of inflation , the nominal price includes infla-
tion. In our example, we assumed that the electric motors coming out of our factory could be sold for $52.50 each over the next 20 years. We said nothing, however, about the effect of inflation. Is the $52.50 a real price, i.e., net of infla-tion, or does it include inflation? As we will see, the answer to this question can be critical.
Let’s assume that the $52.50 price—and the $42.50 production cost—are 
in real terms. This means that if we expect a 5-percent annual rate of infla-tion, the nominal price of the motors will increase from $52.50 in the first year to (1.05)(52.50) = $55.13 in the second year, to (1.05)(55.13) = $57.88 in the third year, and so on. Therefore, our profit of $960,000 per year is also in real terms.Net

 Discount rate, RR*FIGURE 15.3
NET PRESENT VALUE OF  
A FACTORY
The NPV of a factory is the pres-
ent discounted value of all the cash flows involved in build-ing and operating it. Here it is the PDV of the flow of future profits less the current cost of construction. The NPV declines as the discount rate increases. At discount rate R*, the NPV is 
zero.572  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
Now let’s turn to the discount rate. If the cash flows are in real terms, the discount 
rate must also be in real terms . Why? Because the discount rate is the opportunity 
cost of the investment. If inflation is not included in the cash flows, it should not be included in the opportunity cost either.
In our example, the discount rate should therefore be the real interest rate on 
government bonds. The nominal interest rate (9 percent) is the rate that we see in the newspapers; it includes inflation. The real interest rate is the nominal rate 
minus the expected rate of inflation .
11 If we expect inflation to be 5 percent per year 
on average, the real interest rate would be 9 - 5 = 4 percent. This is the discount 
rate that should be used to calculate the NPV of the investment in the electric motor factory. Note from Figure 15.3 that at this rate the NPV is clearly positive, so the investment should be undertaken.
When the NPV rule is used to evaluate investments, the numbers in the cal-
culations may be in real or in nominal terms, as long as they are consistent. If cash flows are in real terms, the discount rate should also be in real terms. If a nominal discount rate is used, the effect of future inflation must also be included in the cash flows.
Negative Future Cash Flows
Factories and other production facilities can take several years to build and equip. The cost of the investment will also be spread out over several years, instead of occurring only at the outset. In addition, some investments are expected to result in losses , rather than profits, for the first few years. (For exam-
ple, demand may be low until consumers learn about the product, or costs may start high and fall only when managers and workers have moved down the learning curve.) Negative future cash flows create no problem for the NPV rule; they are simply discounted, just like positive cash flows.
For example, suppose that our electric motor factory will take a year to build: 
$5 million is spent right away, and another $5 million is spent next year. Also, suppose the factory is expected to lose $1 million in its first year of operation and 
$0.5 million in its second year. Afterward, it will earn $0.96 million a year until year 20, when it will be scrapped for $1 million, as before. (All these cash flows are in real terms.) Now the net present value is
 NPV =-5- 5

Suppose the real interest rate is 4 percent. Should the firm build this fac-
tory? You can confirm that the NPV is negative, so this project is not a good  investment.Opportunity cost is dis-
cussed in §7.1.
11People may have different views about future inflation and may therefore have different estimates 
of the real interest rate.CHAPTER 15   •  Investment, Time, and Capital Markets  573
15.5  Adjustments for Risk
We have seen that a risk-free interest rate is an appropriate discount rate for future 
cash flows that are certain. For most projects, however, future cash flows are far from certain. At our electric motor factory, for example, we would expect uncertainty over future copper prices, over the future demand and the price of motors, and even over future wage rates. Thus the firm cannot know what its profits from the factory will be over the next 20 years. Its best estimate of profits might be $960,000 per year, but actual profits may turn out to be higher or lower. How should the firm take this uncertainty into account when calculating the net present value of the project?
A common practice is to increase the discount rate by adding a risk premium  
to the risk-free rate. The idea is that the owners of the firm are risk averse, which makes future cash flows that are risky worth less than those that are certain. Increasing the discount rate takes this into account by  reducing the present value of those future cash flows. But how large should the risk premium be? As we will see, the answer depends on the nature of the risk.
• risk premium  Amount 
of money that a risk-averse individual will pay to avoid taking a risk.EXAMPLE 15.3   THE VALUE OF A NEW YORK CITY 
TAXI MEDALLION
We saw in Example 9.5 that in 2011, the number of taxi medallions in New 
York was roughly the same as in 1937, so that the price of a medallion was $880,000. (Recall that a medallion is a permit allowing a taxicab to be used to transport passengers.) The medallions are owned by taxi companies, which have successfully pressured the city government to limit the number in  circulation, thereby maintaining the high price — at the cost of making it 
difficult for citizens to find a taxi.
A taxi medallion allows its owner to lease a cab to a driver and thereby earn 
a profit from the operation of the cab. Is that profit high enough to justify an $880,000 value for each medallion? To find out, let’s calculate the flow of income a taxi company can expect from leasing a medallion to one or more taxi drivers.
The taxi company charges the driver a flat fee for use of the medallion, 
but that fee is capped by the city. In 2011, the fee was $110 per 12-hour shift, or $220 per day. Assuming the cab is driven 7 days per week and 50 weeks per year, the taxi company would earn (7)(50)($220) = $77,000 per year from the medallion. Little risk is involved (there is a shortage of taxis, so it is easy to find drivers willing to lease the medallion), and the capped fee has increased with inflation. Therefore a 5-percent discount rate would probably be appropriate for discounting future income flows. Assuming a time horizon of 20 years, the present value of this flow of income is therefore:
PV= 70,000
1.05 + 70,000
1.052 + 70,000
1.053 +c + 70,000
1.0520 =$872,355
Thus a medallion price in the range of $880,000 is consistent with the flow of 
income that the medallion will bring to the taxi company.574  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
Diversifiable versus Nondiversifiable Risk
Adding a risk premium to the discount rate must be done with care. If the firm’s 
managers are operating in the stockholders’ interests, they must distinguish between two kinds of risk— diversifiable  and nondiversifiable .
12 Diversifiable risk  
can be eliminated by investing in many projects or by holding the stocks of many companies. Nondiversifiable risk  cannot be eliminated in this way. Only nondiver-
sifiable risk affects the opportunity cost of capital and should enter into the risk premium .
DIVERSIFIABLE RISK  To understand this, recall from Chapter 5 that diversify-
ing can eliminate many risks. For example, I cannot know whether the result of a coin flip will be heads or tails. But I can be reasonably sure that out of a thousand coin flips, roughly half will be heads. Similarly, an insurance company that sells me life insurance cannot know how long I will live. But by selling life insurance to thousands of people, it can be reasonably sure about the percentage of those who will die each year.
Much the same is true about capital investment decisions. Although the profit 
flow from a single investment may be very risky, overall risk will be much less if the firm invests in dozens of projects (as most large firms do). Furthermore, even if the company invests in only one project, stockholders can easily diver-sify by holding the stocks of a dozen or more different companies, or by holding a mutual fund that invests in many stocks. Thus, stockholders—the owners of the firm—can eliminate diversifiable risk.
Because investors can eliminate diversifiable risk, they cannot expect to earn 
a return higher than the risk-free rate by bearing it: No one will pay you for bearing a risk that there is no need to bear. And indeed, assets that have only diversifiable risk tend on average to earn a return close to the risk-free rate. Now, remember that the discount rate for a project is the opportunity cost of investing in that project rather than in some other project or asset with similar risk char-acteristics . Therefore, if the project’s only risk is diversifiable, the opportunity 
cost is the risk-free rate. No risk premium should be added to the discount rate .
NONDIVERSIFIABLE RISK  What about nondiversifiable risk? First, let’s be 
clear about how such risk can arise. For a life insurance company, the possibility of a major war poses nondiversifiable risk. Because a war may increase mortal-ity rates sharply, the company cannot expect that an “average” number of its customers will die each year, no matter how many customers it has. As a result, most insurance policies, whether for life, health, or property, do not cover losses resulting from acts of war.
For capital investments, nondiversifiable risk arises because a firm’s profits 
tend to depend on the overall economy. When economic growth is strong, cor-porate profits tend to be higher. (For our electric motor factory, the demand for motors is likely to be strong, so profits increase.) On the other hand, profits tend to fall in a recession. Because future economic growth is uncertain, diversifica-tion cannot eliminate all risk. Investors should (and indeed can) earn higher returns by bearing this risk.
To the extent that a project has nondiversifiable risk, the opportunity cost of 
investing in that project is higher than the risk-free rate. Thus a risk premium • diversifiable risk  Risk that 
can be eliminated either by investing in many projects or by holding the stocks of many companies.
• nondiversifiable risk  Risk 
that cannot be eliminated by investing in many projects or by holding the stocks of many companies.
12Diversifiable risk is also called nonsystematic  risk and nondiversifiable risk is called systematic  risk. 
Adding a simple risk premium to the discount rate may not always be the correct way of dealing with risk. See, for example, Richard Brealey and Stewart Myers, Principles of Corporate Finance  (New 
York: McGraw-Hill, 2011).CHAPTER 15   •  Investment, Time, and Capital Markets  575
must be included in the discount rate. Let’s see how the size of that risk pre-
mium can be determined.
The Capital Asset Pricing Model
The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)  measures the risk premium for a cap-
ital investment by comparing the expected return on that investment with the expected return on the entire stock market. To understand the model, suppose, first, that you invest in the entire stock market (say, through a mutual fund). In that case, your investment would be completely diversified and you would bear no diversifiable risk. You would, however, bear nondiversifiable risk because the stock market tends to move with the overall economy. (The stock market reflects expected future profits, which depend in part on the economy.) As a result, the expected return on the stock market is higher than the risk-free rate. Denoting the expected return on the stock market by r
m and the risk-free rate by rf, the risk 
premium on the market is rm-rf. This is the additional expected return you get 
for bearing the nondiversifiable risk associated with the stock market.
Now consider the nondiversifiable risk associated with one asset, such as a com-
pany’s stock. We can measure that risk in terms of the extent to which the return on the asset tends to be correlated  with (i.e., move in the same direction as) the return on 
the stock market as a whole. For example, one company’s stock might have almost no correlation with the market as a whole. On average, the price of that stock would move independently of changes in the market, so it would have little or no nondi-versifiable risk. The return on that stock should therefore be about the same as the risk-free rate. Another stock, however, might be highly correlated with the market. Its price changes might even amplify changes in the market as a whole. That stock would have substantial nondiversifiable risk, perhaps more than the stock market as a whole. If so, its return on average will exceed the market return r
m.
The CAPM summarizes this relationship between expected returns and the 
risk premium by the following equation:
 ri-rj=b(rm-rf) (15.6)
where ri is the expected return on an asset. The equation says that the risk pre-
mium on the asset (its expected return less the risk-free rate) is proportional to the risk premium on the market. The constant of proportionality, b, is called the asset 
beta.  It measures the sensitivity of the asset’s return to market movements and, 
therefore, the asset’s nondiversifiable risk. If a 1-percent rise in the market tends to result in a 2-percent rise in the asset price, the beta is 2. If a 1-percent rise in the market tends to result in a 1-percent rise in the asset price, the beta is 1. And if a 1-percent rise in the market tends to result in no change in the price of the asset, the beta is zero. As equation (15.6) shows, the larger the beta, the greater the expected return on the asset. Why? Because the asset’s nondiversifiable risk is greater.
THE RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATE  Given beta, we can determine the cor-
rect discount rate to use in computing an asset’s net present value. That discount rate is the expected return on the asset or on another asset with the same risk. It is therefore the risk-free rate plus a risk premium to reflect nondiversifiable risk:
 Discount rate =r

• asset beta  A constant 
that measures the sensitivity of an asset’s return to market movements and, therefore, the asset’s nondiversifiable risk.576  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
Over the past 60 years, the risk premium on the stock market, ( rm-rf), has been 
about 8 percent on average. If the real risk-free rate were 4 percent and beta were 0.6, the correct discount rate would be 0.04 + 0.6(0.08) = 0.09, or 9 percent.
If the asset is a stock, its beta can usually be estimated statistically.
13 When 
the asset is a new factory, however, determining its beta is more difficult. Many firms therefore use the company cost of capital as a (nominal) discount rate. The  company cost of capital  is a weighted average of the expected return on the com-
pany’s stock (which depends on the beta of the stock) and the interest rate that it pays for debt. This approach is correct as long as the capital investment in question is typical for the company as a whole. It can be misleading, however, if the capital investment has much more or much less nondiversifiable risk than the company as a whole. In that case, it may be better to make a reasoned guess as to how much the revenues from the investment are likely to depend on the overall economy.• company cost of capital

13You can estimate beta by running a linear regression of the return on the stock against the excess 
return on the market, rm- rf. Or you can look it up on a financial Web site like Yahoo! Finance or  
E*Trade, which give detailed information on individual stocks. In August 2011, Yahoo! Finance listed a beta of 1.07 for the Intel Corporation and 1.46 for Eastman Kodak.EXAMPLE 15.4   CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE 
DISPOSABLE DIAPER INDUSTRY
In Example 13.6 (page 515), we dis-
cussed the disposable diaper indus-try, which has been dominated by two companies, Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark. We explained that their continuing R&D (research and development) expenditures have given these firms a cost advantage that deters entry. Now we’ll examine the 
capital investment decision of a potential entrant.
Suppose you are considering entering this industry. To take advantage 
of scale economies in production, advertising, and distribution, you would need to build three plants at a cost of $60 million each, with the cost spread over three years. When operating at capacity, the plants would produce a total of 2.5 billion diapers per year. These would be sold at wholesale for about 16 cents per diaper, yielding revenues of about $400 million per year. You can expect your variable production costs to be about $290 million per year, for a net revenue of $110 million per year.
You will, however, have other expenses. Using the experience of P&G and 
Kimberly-Clark as a guide, you can expect to spend about $60 million in R&D before start-up to design an efficient manufacturing process, and another $20 million in R&D during each year of production to maintain and improve that process. Finally, once you are operating at full capacity, you can expect to spend another $50 million per year for a sales force, advertising, and mar-keting. Your net operating profit will be $40 million per year. The plants will last for 15 years and will then be obsolete.
CHAPTER 15   •  Investment, Time, and Capital Markets  577
Is the investment a good idea? To find out, let’s calculate its net present 
value. Table 15.5 shows the relevant numbers. We assume that production begins at 33 percent of capacity when the plant is completed in 2015, takes two years to reach full capacity, and continues through the year 2030. Given the net cash flows, the NPV is calculated as
NPV=-120 - 93.4
(1+R) - 56.6
(1+R)2 + 40
(1+R)3
+ 40
(1+R)4 +g+ 40
(1+R)15
Table 15.5 shows the NPV for discount rates of 5, 10, and 15 percent.
Note that the NPV is positive for a discount rate of 5 percent, but it is 
negative for discount rates of 10 or 15 percent. What is the correct dis-count rate? First, we have ignored inflation, so the discount rate should be in real terms. Second, the cash flows are risky—we don’t know how 
efficient our plants will be, how effective our advertising and promotion will be, or even what the future demand for disposable diapers will be. Some of this risk is nondiversifiable. To calculate the risk premium, we will use a beta of 1, which is typical for a producer of consumer prod-ucts of this sort. Using 4 percent for the real risk-free interest rate and  
8 percent for the risk premium on the stock market, our discount rate should be
R=0.04 +1(0.08) =0.12

15.6  Investment Decisions by Consumers
We have seen how firms value future cash flows and thereby decide whether to 
invest in long-lived capital. Consumers face similar decisions when they pur-chase durable goods, such as cars or major appliances. Unlike the decision to purchase food, entertainment, or clothing, the decision to buy a durable good involves comparing a flow of future  benefits with the current  purchase cost.
Suppose that you are deciding whether to buy a new car. If you keep the car for 
six or seven years, most of the benefits (and costs of operation) will occur in the future. You must therefore compare the future flow of net benefits from owning the car (the benefit of having transportation less the cost of insurance, maintenance, and gasoline) with the purchase price. Likewise, when deciding whether to buy a new air conditioner, you must compare its price with the present value of the flow of net benefits (the benefit of a cool room less the cost of electricity to operate the unit).
These problems are analogous to the problem of a firm that must compare a 
future flow of profits with the current cost of plant and equipment when mak-ing a capital investment decision. We can therefore analyze these problems just as we analyzed the firm’s investment problem. Let’s do this for a consumer’s decision to buy a car.
The main benefit from owning a car is the flow of transportation services it 
provides. The value of those services differs from consumer to consumer. Let’s assume our consumer values the service at S dollars per year. Let’s also assume 
that the total operating expense (insurance, maintenance, and gasoline) is E dollars 
per year, that the car costs $20,000, and that after six years, its resale value will be $4000. The decision to buy the car can then be framed in terms of net present value:
 NPV =-20,000 +(S-E)+ (S-E)
(1+R) + (S-E)
(1+R)2 (15.8)
+g+ (S-E)
(1+R)6 + 4000
(1+R)6
What discount rate R should the consumer use? The consumer should apply 
the same principle that a firm does: The discount rate is the opportunity cost of money. If the consumer already has $20,000 and does not need a loan, the correct discount rate is the return that could be earned by investing the money in another asset—say, a savings account or a government bond. On the other hand, if the consumer is in debt, the discount rate would be the borrowing rate that he or she is already paying. Because this rate is likely to be much higher At this discount rate, the NPV is clearly negative, so the investment does 
not make sense. You will not enter the industry, and P&G and Kimberly-Clark can breathe a sigh of relief. Don’t be surprised, however, that these firms can make money in this market while you cannot. Their experience, years of earlier R&D (they need not spend $60 million on R&D before building new plants), and brand name recognition give them a competitive advantage that a new entrant will find hard to overcome.CHAPTER 15   •  Investment, Time, and Capital Markets  579
than the interest rate on a bond or savings account, the NPV of the investment 
will be smaller.
Consumers must often make trade-offs between up-front versus future pay-
ments. An example is the decision of whether to buy or lease a new car. Suppose you can buy a new Toyota Corolla for $15,000 and, after six years, sell it for $6000. Alternatively, you could lease the car for $300 per month for three years, and at the end of the three years, return the car. Which is better—buying or leasing? The answer depends on the interest rate. If the interest rate is very low, buying the car is preferable because the present value of the future lease pay-ments is high. If the interest rate is high, leasing is preferable because the pres-ent value of the future lease payments is low.
EXAMPLE 15.5   CHOOSING AN AIR CONDITIONER 
AND A NEW CAR
Buying a new air conditioner involves 
making a trade-off. Some air condition-ers cost less but are less efficient—they consume a lot of electricity relative to their cooling power. Others cost more but are more efficient. Should you buy an inefficient air conditioner that costs less now but will cost more to operate in the future, or an efficient one that costs more now but will cost less to operate?
Let’s assume that you are comparing air conditioners of equivalent cooling 
power, so that they yield the same flow of benefits. We can then compare the present discounted values of their costs. Assuming an eight-year lifetime and no resale, the PDV of the cost of buying and operating air conditioner i is
PDV=C
i+OC i+ OC i
(1+R) + OC i
(1+R)2 +g+ OC i
(1+R)8
where Ci is the purchase price of air conditioner i and OCi is its average 
annual operating cost.
The preferred air conditioner depends on your discount rate. If you have 
little free cash and must borrow, you should use a high discount rate. Because this would make the present value of the future operating costs smaller, you would probably choose a less expensive but relatively inefficient unit. If you have plenty of free cash, so that your opportunity cost of money (and thus your discount rate) is low, you would probably buy the more expensive unit.
An econometric study of household purchases of air conditioners shows 
that consumers tend to trade off capital costs and expected future operat-ing costs in just this way, although the discount rates that people use are high—about 20 percent for the population as a whole.
14 (American consum-
ers seem to behave myopically by overdiscounting future savings.) The study

15.7  Investments in Human Capital
So far, we have discussed how firms and consumers can decide whether to 
invest in physical capital —buildings and equipment, in the case of firms, and 
durable goods such as cars and major appliances, in the case of consumers. We have seen how to apply the net present value rule to these decisions: Invest when the present value of the gains from the investment exceeds the present value of the costs.
Some very important investment decisions involve human capital  rather than 
physical capital. Given that you are now reading this book, you are probably making an investment in your own human capital at this very moment.
16 By 
studying microeconomics, perhaps as part of an undergraduate or graduate degree program, you are obtaining valuable knowledge and skills that will make you more productive in the future.
Human capital  is the knowledge, skills, and experience that make an individual 
more productive and thereby able to earn a higher income over a lifetime . If you go 
to college or graduate school, take postgraduate courses, or enroll in a special-ized job training program, you are investing in human capital. Most likely, the money, time, and effort that you invest to build up your human capital will pay off in the form of more rewarding or high-paying job opportunities.
How should an individual decide whether to invest in human capital? To 
answer this question, we can use the same net present value rule that we have applied to investments in physical capital.
Suppose, for example, that upon completing high school you are decid-
ing whether to go to college for four years or skip college and go to work • human capital  Knowledge, 
skills, and experience that make an individual more productive and thereby able to earn a higher income over a lifetime.also shows that consumers’ discount rates vary inversely with their incomes. 
For example, people with above-average incomes used discount rates of about 9 percent, while those in the bottom quarter of the income distribu-tion used discount rates of 39 percent or more. We would expect this result because higher-income people are likely to have more free cash available and therefore have a lower opportunity cost of money.
Buying a new car involves a similar trade-off. One car might cost less 
than another but offer lower fuel efficiency and require more maintenance and repairs, so that expected future operating costs are higher. As with air conditioners, a consumer can compare two or more cars by calculating and  comparing the PDV of the purchase price and expected average annual 
operating cost for each. An econometric study of automobile purchases found that consumers indeed trade off the purchase price and expected operating costs in this way.
15 It found the average discount rate for all con-
sumers to be in the range of 11 to 17 percent. These discount rate estimates are somewhat lower than those for air conditioners, and probably reflect the widespread availability of auto loans.
15See Mark K. Dreyfus and W. Kip Viscusi, “Rates of Time Preference and Consumer Valuations of 
Automobile Safety and Fuel Efficiency,” Journal of Law and Economics  38 (April 1995): 79–105.
16On the other hand, finding this book more entertaining than a good novel, you might be reading 
it purely for pleasure.CHAPTER 15   •  Investment, Time, and Capital Markets  581
instead. To keep things as simple as possible, let’s analyze this decision on 
a purely financial basis and ignore any pleasure (in the form of parties and football games) or pain (in the form of exams and papers) that college might entail. We will calculate the NPV of the costs and benefits of getting a college degree.
THE NPV OF A COLLEGE EDUCATION  There are two major costs associated 
with college. First, because you will be studying rather than working, you will incur the opportunity cost of the lost wages that you could have earned had you taken a job. For a typical high school graduate in the United States, those lost wages might be about $20,000 per year. The second major cost is for tuition, room and board, and related expenses (such as the cost of this book). Tuition and room and board can vary widely, depending on whether one is attending a public or private college, whether one is living at home or on campus, and whether one is receiving a scholarship. Let’s use $20,000 per year as a rough average number. (Most public universities are less expensive, but many private colleges and universities cost more.) Thus we will take the total economic cost of attending college to be $40,000 per year for each of four years.
An important benefit of college is the ability to earn a higher salary through-
out your working life. In the United States, a college graduate will on average earn about $20,000 per year more than a high school graduate. In practice, the salary differential is largest during the first 5 to 10 years following college grad-uation, and then becomes smaller. For simplicity, however, we will assume that this $20,000 salary differential persists for 20 years. In that case, the NPV (in $1000’s) of investing in a college education is
NPV =-40-40
(1+R)-40
(1+R)2-40
(1+R)3+20
(1+R)4+g+20
(1+R)23
What discount rate, R, should one use to calculate this NPV? Because we 
have kept the costs and benefits fixed over time, we are implicitly ignoring infla-tion. Thus we should use a real discount rate. In this case, a reasonable real dis-
count rate would be about 5 percent. This rate would reflect the opportunity cost of money for many households—the return that could be made by invest-ing in assets other than human capital. You can check that the NPV is then about $66,000. With a 5-percent discount rate, investing in a college education is a good idea, at least as a purely financial matter.
Although the NPV of a college education is a positive number, it is not very 
large. Why isn’t the financial return from going to college higher? Because in the United States, entry into college has become attainable for the major-ity of graduating high school seniors.
17 In other words, a college education 
is an investment with close to free entry. As we saw in Chapter 8, in markets with free entry, we should expect to see zero economic profits, which implies that investments will earn a competitive return. Of course, a low economic return doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t complete your college degree—there are many benefits to a college education that go beyond increases in future earnings.In §15.4, we discuss real ver-
sus nominal discount rates, and explain that the real discount rate is the nominal rate minus the expected rate of inflation.
In §8.7 we explain that zero economic profit means that a firm is earning a competi-tive return on its investment.
17This is not to say that all high school graduates can go to the college of their choice. Some colleges 
are selective and require high grades and test scores for admission. But the large number of colleges and universities in the United States makes an undergraduate education an option for the majority of high school graduates.582  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
EXAMPLE 15.6   SHOULD YOU GO TO BUSINESS 
SCHOOL?
Many readers of this book are contem-
plating attending business school and earning an MBA degree or are already enrolled in an MBA program. Those of you thinking about business school (or already attending) might be wondering whether an MBA is worth the invest-ment. Let’s see if we can help you with your concern.
For most people, getting an MBA 
means an increase—very often a big 
increase—in salary. Table 15.6 shows estimates of average pre-MBA and post-MBA salaries for 32 business schools, 24 in the United States and 8 in other countries.
18 As you can see, the increases in salaries are dra-
matic. Bear in mind, however, that not all MBA programs are included in  
Table 15.6. Indeed, because the list includes many of the top MBA pro-grams—and because the salaries are self-reported—they probably overstate average MBA salaries for all graduates. For the United States as a whole, a rough estimate of the average salary of students about to enter business school is around $45,000 per year and the average increase  in salary upon 
obtaining the MBA degree is about $30,000 per year. For our simple analysis, we will assume that this $30,000 per year gain in salary persists for 20 years.
The typical MBA program in the United States takes two years and involves 
tuition and expenses of $45,000 per year. (Very few MBA students obtain scholarships.) In addition to tuition and expenses, it is important to include the opportunity cost of the foregone pre-MBA salary, i.e., another $45,000 per year. Thus, the total economic cost of getting an MBA is $90,000 per year for each of two years. The NPV of this investment is therefore
NPV=-90-90
(1+R)+90
(1+R)2+g+30
(1+R)21
You can check that using a real discount rate of 5 percent, the NPV comes 
out to about $180,000.
Why is the payoff from an MBA at schools like those listed in Table 15.6 so 
much higher than the payoff from a four-year undergraduate degree? Because entry into many MBA programs (and especially the programs listed in Table 15.6) is selective and difficult. (The same is true for other professional degree pro-grams, such as law and medicine.) Because many more people apply to MBA programs than there are spaces, the return on the degree remains high.
Should you go to business school? As we have just seen, the financial part of 
this decision is easy: Though costly, the return on this investment is very high.

*15.8   Intertemporal Production Decisions—
Depletable Resources
Production decisions often have intertemporal  aspects—production today affects 
sales or costs in the future. The learning curve, which we discussed in Chapter 7, is an example of this. By producing today, the firm gains experience that lowers future costs. In this case, production today is partly an investment in future cost reduction, and the value of this investment must be taken into account when comparing costs and benefits. Another example is the production of a deplet-able resource. When the owner of an oil well pumps oil today, less oil is avail-able for future production. This must be taken into account when deciding how much to produce.
Production decisions in cases like these involve comparisons between costs 
and benefits today with costs and benefits in the future. We can make those comparisons using the concept of present discounted value. We’ll look in detail at the case of a depletable resource, although the same principles apply to other intertemporal production decisions.
The Production Decision of an Individual Resource 
Producer
Suppose your rich uncle gives you an oil well. The well contains 1000 barrels of 
oil that can be produced at a constant average and marginal cost of $10 per bar-rel. Should you produce all the oil today, or should you save it for the future?
19
You might think that the answer depends on the profit you can earn if you 
remove the oil from the ground. After all, why not remove the oil if its price is greater than the cost of extraction? However, this ignores the opportunity cost of using up the oil today so that it is not available for the future.
The correct answer, then, depends not on the current profit level but on how 
fast you expect the price of oil to rise. Oil in the ground is like money in the bank: You should keep it in the ground only if it earns a return at least as high as the market interest rate. If you expect the price of oil to remain constant or rise very slowly, you would be better off extracting and selling all of it now and investing the proceeds. But if you expect the price of oil to rise rapidly, you should leave it in the ground.Recall from §7.6 that with 
a learning curve, the firm’s cost of production falls over time as managers and work-ers become more experi-enced and more effective at using available plant and equipment.Of course, there are other factors that might influence your  decision. Some 
students, for example, find the courses they take in business school (especially economics) to be very interesting. Others find the experience to be about as much fun as having a root canal. And then there is the question of whether your undergraduate grades and test scores are sufficiently high to make this particu-lar investment in human capital an option for you. Finally, and most importantly, you might find another career choice more rewarding, whether or not it turns out to be more profitable. We leave it to you to calculate the returns to educa-tional investments in the arts, law, or education itself (teaching).
19For most real oil wells, marginal and average cost are not constant, and it would be extremely 
costly to extract all the oil in a short time. We will ignore this complication.CHAPTER 15   •  Investment, Time, and Capital Markets  585
How fast must the price rise for you to keep the oil in the ground? The value 
of each barrel of oil in your well is equal to the price of oil less the $10 cost of extracting it. (This is the profit you can obtain by extracting and selling each barrel.) This value must rise at least as fast as the rate of interest for you to keep the oil. Your production decision rule is therefore: Keep all your oil if you expect 
its price less its extraction cost to rise faster than the rate of interest. Extract and sell all of it if you expect price less cost to rise at less than the rate of interest . What if you 
expect price less cost to rise at exactly the rate of interest? Then you would be indifferent between extracting the oil and leaving it in the ground. Letting P
t be 
the price of oil this year, Pt+1 the price next year, and c the cost of extraction, we 
can write this production rule as follows:
If (Pt+1-c) > (1 + R)(Pt-c), keep the oil in the ground.
If (Pt+1-c) < (1 + R)(Pt-c), sell all the oil now.
If (Pt+1-c) = (1 + R)(Pt-c), makes no difference.
Given our expectation about the growth rate of oil prices, we can use this rule 
to determine production. But how fast should we expect the market price of oil to rise?
The Behavior of Market Price
Suppose there were no OPEC cartel and the oil market consisted of many com-petitive producers with oil wells like our own. We could then determine how quickly oil prices are likely to rise by considering the production decisions of other producers. If other producers want to earn the highest possible return, they will follow the production rule we stated above. This means that price less 
marginal cost must rise at exactly the rate of interest .
20 To see why, suppose price less 
cost were to rise faster than the rate of interest. In that case, no one would sell any oil. Inevitably, this would drive up the current price. If, on the other hand, price less cost were to rise at a rate less than the rate of interest, everyone would try to sell all of their oil immediately, which would drive the current price down.
Figure 15.4 illustrates how the market price must rise. The marginal cost of 
extraction is c, and the price and total quantity produced are initially P
0 and Q0. 
Part (a) shows the net price, P-c, rising at the rate of interest. Part (b) shows 
that as price rises, the quantity demanded falls. This continues until time T, when 
all the oil has been used up and the price PT is such that demand is just zero.
User Cost
We saw in Chapter 8 that a competitive firm always produces up to the point 
at which price is equal to marginal cost. However, in a competitive market for an exhaustible resource, price exceeds  marginal cost (and the difference between 
price and marginal cost rises over time). Does this conflict with what we learned in Chapter 8?
No, once we recognize that the total marginal cost of producing an exhaust-
ible resource is greater than the marginal cost of extracting it from the ground. There is an additional opportunity cost because producing and selling a unit today makes it unavailable for production and sale in the future. We call this opportunity cost the user cost of production.  In Figure 15.4, user cost is the 
• user cost of production  
Opportunity cost of producing and selling a unit today and so making it unavailable for production and sale in the future.
20This result is called the Hotelling rule  because it was first demonstrated by Harold Hotelling in “The 
Economics of Exhaustible Resources,” Journal of Political Economy  39 (April 1931): 137–75.586  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
 difference between price and marginal production cost. It rises over time because 
as the resource remaining in the ground becomes scarcer, the opportunity cost of depleting another unit becomes higher.
Resource Production by a Monopolist
What if the resource is produced by a monopolist  rather than by a competitive 
industry? Should price less marginal cost still rise at the rate of interest?
Suppose a monopolist is deciding between keeping an incremental unit of a 
resource in the ground, or producing and selling it. The value of that unit is the marginal revenue  less the marginal cost. The unit should be left in the ground if 
its value is expected to rise faster than the rate of interest; it should be produced and sold if its value is expected to rise at less than the rate of interest. Since the 
monopolist controls total output, it will produce so that marginal revenue less marginal cost—i.e., the value of an incremental unit of resource—rises at exactly the rate of interest:
(MR
t+1-c)=(1+R)(MR t-c)
Note that this rule also holds for a competitive firm. For a competitive firm, 
however, marginal revenue equals the market price p.
For a monopolist facing a downward-sloping demand curve, price is greater 
than marginal revenue. Therefore, if marginal revenue less marginal cost rises at the rate of interest, price  less marginal cost will rise at less than the rate of In §10.1, we explain that a 
monopolist maximizes its profit by choosing an output at which marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost.Price

PRICE OF AN EXHAUSTIBLE RESOURCE
In (a), the price is shown rising over time. Units of a resource in the ground must earn a return commensurate 
with that on other assets. Therefore, in a competitive market, price less marginal production cost will rise at the rate of interest. Part (b) shows the movement up the demand curve as price rises.CHAPTER 15   •  Investment, Time, and Capital Markets  587
interest. We thus have the interesting result that a monopolist is more conserva-
tionist  than a competitive industry. In exercising monopoly power, the monopo-
list starts out charging a higher price and depletes the resource more slowly.
EXAMPLE 15.7  HOW DEPLETABLE ARE DEPLETABLE RESOURCES?
Resources such as oil, natural gas, coal, uranium, copper, iron, lead, zinc, nickel, and helium are all depletable: Because there is a finite amount of each in the earth’s crust, the production and consumption of each will ulti-mately cease. Nonetheless, some resources are more depletable than others.
For oil, natural gas, and helium, known and poten-
tially discoverable in-ground reserves are equal to only 50 to 100 years of current consumption. For these resources, the user cost of production can be a significant component of the market price. Other resources, such as coal and iron, have a proven and potential reserve base equal to several hundred or even thousands of years of current consumption. For these resources, the user cost is very small.
The user cost for a resource can be estimated 
from geological information about existing and potentially discoverable reserves, and from knowl-edge of the demand curve and the rate at which that curve is likely to shift out over time in response to economic growth. If the market is competitive, user cost can be determined from the economic rent earned by the owners of resource-bearing lands.
Table 15.7 shows estimates of user cost as a frac-
tion of the competitive price for crude oil, natural gas, uranium, copper, bauxite, nickel, iron ore, and gold.
21 Note that only for crude oil and natural gas 
is user cost a substantial component of price. For the other resources, it is small and in some cases almost negligible. Moreover, although most of these resources have experienced sharp price  fluctuations, user cost had almost nothing to do 
with those fluctuations. For exam-ple, oil prices changed because of OPEC and political turmoil in the Persian Gulf, natural gas prices because of changes in energy demand, uranium and bauxite prices because of cartelization during the 1970s, and copper 
prices because of strikes and changes in demand.
21These numbers are based on Michael J. Mueller, “Scarcity and Ricardian Rents for Crude Oil,”

Resource depletion, then, has not been very 
important as a determinant of resource prices over the past few decades. Much more important have been market structure and changes in market demand. But the role of depletion should not be ignored. Over the long term, it will be the ultimate determinant of resource prices.588  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
15.9  How Are Interest Rates Determined?
We have seen how market interest rates are used to help make capital invest-
ment and intertemporal production decisions. But what determines interest rate levels? Why do they fluctuate over time? To answer these questions, remember that an interest rate is the price that borrowers pay lenders to use their funds. Like any market price, interest rates are determined by supply and demand—in this case, the supply and demand for loanable funds.
The supply of loanable funds  comes from households that wish to save part 
of their incomes in order to consume more in the future (or make bequests to their heirs). For example, some households have high incomes now but expect to earn less after retirement. Saving lets them spread their consumption more evenly over time. In addition, because they receive interest on the money they lend, they can consume more in the future in return for consuming less now. As a result, the higher the interest rate, the greater the incentive to save. The supply of loanable funds is therefore an upward-sloping curve, labeled S in 
Figure 15.5.
The demand for loanable funds  has two components. First, some households 
want to consume more than their current incomes, either because their incomes are low now but are expected to grow, or because they want to make a large purchase (e.g., a house) that must be paid for out of future income. These house-holds are willing to pay interest in return for not having to wait to consume. However, the higher the interest rate, the greater the cost of consuming rather than waiting, so the less willing these households will be to borrow. The house-hold demand for loanable funds is therefore a declining function of the interest rate. In Figure 15.5, it is the curve labeled D
H.
The second source of demand for loanable funds is firms that want to make 
capital investments. Remember that firms will invest in projects with NPVs that are positive because a positive NPV means that the expected return on the project exceeds the opportunity cost of funds. That opportunity cost—the dis-count rate used to calculate the NPV—is the interest rate, perhaps adjusted for 
R

FIGURE 15.5
SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR LOANABLE FUNDS
Market interest rates are determined by the demand and 
supply of loanable funds. Households supply funds in order to consume more in the future; the higher the interest rate, the more they supply. Households and firms both demand funds, but the higher the interest rate, the less they demand. Shifts in demand or supply cause changes in interest rates.CHAPTER 15   •  Investment, Time, and Capital Markets  589
risk. Often firms borrow to invest because the flow of profits from an invest-
ment comes in the future while the cost of an investment must usually be paid now. The desire of firms to invest is thus an important source of demand for loanable funds.
As we saw earlier, however, the higher the interest rate, the lower the NPV of 
a project. If interest rates rise, some investment projects that had positive NPVs will now have negative NPVs and will therefore be cancelled. Overall, because firms’ willingness to invest falls when interest rates rise, their demand for loan-able funds also falls. The demand for loanable funds by firms is thus a down-ward-sloping curve; in Figure 15.5, it is labeled D
F.
The total demand for loanable funds is the sum of household demand and 
firm demand; in Figure 15.5, it is the curve DT. This total demand curve, together 
with the supply curve, determines the equilibrium interest rate. In Figure 15.5, that rate is R*.
Figure 15.5 can also help us understand why interest rates change. 
Suppose the economy goes into a recession. Firms will expect lower sales and lower future profits from new capital investments. The NPVs of projects will fall, and firms’ willingness to invest will decline, as will their demand for loanable funds. D
F, and therefore DT, will shift to the left, and the equilib-
rium interest rate will fall. Or suppose the federal government spends much more money than it collects through taxes—i.e., that it runs a large deficit. It will have to borrow to finance the deficit, shifting the total demand for loanable funds D
T to the right, so that R increases. The monetary policies of 
the Federal Reserve are another important determinant of interest rates. The Federal Reserve can create money, shifting the supply of loanable funds to the right and reducing R.
A Variety of Interest Rates
Figure 15.5 aggregates individual demands and supplies as though there were 
a single market interest rate. In fact, households, firms, and the government lend and borrow under a variety of terms and conditions. As a result, there is a wide range of “market” interest rates. Here we briefly describe some of the more important rates that are quoted in the newspapers and sometimes used for capital investment decisions.
• Treasury Bill Rate  A Treasury bill is a short-term (one year or less) bond is-
sued by the U.S. government. It is a pure discount bond —i.e., it makes no cou-
pon payments but instead is sold at a price less than its redemption value at maturity. For example, a three-month Treasury bill might be sold for $98. In three months, it can be redeemed for $100; it thus has an effective three-month yield of about 2 percent and an effective annual yield of about 8 percent.
22 The 
Treasury bill rate can be viewed as a short-term, risk-free rate.
• Treasury Bond Rate  A Treasury bond is a longer-term bond issued by the 
U.S. government for more than one year and typically for 10 to 30 years. Rates vary, depending on the maturity of the bond.
• Discount Rate  Commercial banks sometimes borrow for short periods from 
the Federal Reserve. These loans are called discounts , and the rate that the 
Federal Reserve charges on them is the discount rate.
22To be exact, the three-month yield is (100/98) -1 = 0.0204, and the annual yield is (100/98)4-1 = 
0.0842, or 8.42 percent.590  PART 3   •  Market Structure and Competitive Strategy
• Federal Funds Rate  This is the interest rate that banks charge one another 
for overnight loans of federal funds. Federal funds consist of currency in circulation plus deposits held at Federal Reserve banks. Banks keep funds at Federal Reserve banks in order to meet reserve requirements. Banks with excess reserves may lend these funds to banks with reserve deficiencies at the federal funds rate. The federal funds rate is a key instrument of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve.
• Commercial Paper Rate  Commercial paper refers to short-term (six months 
or less) discount bonds issued by high-quality corporate borrowers. Because commercial paper is only slightly riskier than Treasury bills, the commercial paper rate is usually less than 1 percent higher than the Treasury bill rate.
• Prime Rate  This is the rate (sometimes called the reference rate ) that large 
banks post as a reference point for short-term loans to their biggest corporate borrowers. As we saw in Example 12.4 (page 475), this rate does not fluctuate from day to day as other rates do.
• Corporate Bond Rate  Newspapers and government publications report the 
average annual yields on long-term (typically 20-year) corporate bonds in different risk categories (e.g., high-grade, medium-grade, etc.). These aver-age yields indicate how much corporations are paying for long-term debt. However, as we saw in Example 15.2, the yields on corporate bonds can vary considerably, depending on the financial strength of the corporation and the time to maturity for the bond.
SUMMARY
 1. A firm’s holding of capital is measured as a stock, but 
inputs of labor and raw materials are flows. Its stock of capital enables a firm to earn a flow of profits over time.
 2. When a firm makes a capital investment, it spends 
money now in order to earn profits in the future. To decide whether the investment is worthwhile, the firm must determine the present value of future profits by discounting them.
 3. The present discounted value (PDV) of $1 paid one 
year from now is $1/(1 + R), where R is the interest 
rate. The PDV of $1 paid n years from now is $1/(1 + 
R)
n.
 4. A bond is a contract in which a lender agrees to pay 
the bondholder a stream of money. The value of the bond is the PDV of that stream. The effective yield on a bond is the interest rate that equates that value with the bond’s market price. Bond yields differ because of differences in riskiness and time to maturity.
 5. Firms can decide whether to undertake a capital invest-
ment by applying the net present value (NPV) crite-rion: Invest if the present value of the expected future cash flows is larger than the cost of the investment.
 6. The discount rate that a firm uses to calculate the NPV 
for an investment should be the opportunity cost of capital—i.e., the return the firm could earn on a similar investment. 7. When calculating NPVs, if cash flows are in nomi-
nal terms (i.e., include inflation), the discount rate should also be nominal; if cash flows are in real terms (i.e., are net of inflation), a real discount rate should be used.
 8. An adjustment for risk can be made by adding a risk 
premium to the discount rate. However, the risk pre-mium should reflect only nondiversifiable risk. Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the risk pre-mium is the “asset beta” for the project multiplied by the risk premium on the stock market as a whole. The “asset beta” measures the sensitivity of the project’s return to movements in the market.
 9. Consumers are faced with investment decisions that 
require the same kind of analysis as those of firms. When deciding whether to buy a durable good like a car or a major appliance, the consumer must consider the present value of future operating costs.
 10. Investments in human capital—the knowledge, skills, 
and experience that make an individual more produc-tive and thereby able to earn a higher income in the future—can be evaluated in much the same way as other investments. Investing in further education, for example, makes economic sense if the present value of the expected future increases in income exceeds the present value of the costs.CHAPTER 15   •  Investment, Time, and Capital Markets  591
 11. An exhaustible resource in the ground is like money 
in the bank and must earn a comparable return. Therefore, if the market is competitive, price less mar-ginal extraction cost will grow at the rate of interest. The difference between price and marginal cost is called user cost —the opportunity cost of depleting a 
unit of the resource. 12. Market interest rates are determined by the demand 
and supply of loanable funds. Households supply funds so that they can consume more in the future. Households, firms, and the government demand funds. Changes in demand or supply cause changes in interest rates.

calculations? What is the difference between diversifi-able and nondiversifiable risk? Why should only non-diversifiable risk enter into the risk premium?
 9. What is meant by the “market return” in the Capital 
Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)? Why is the market return greater than the risk-free interest rate? What does an asset’s “beta” measure in the CAPM? Why should high-beta assets have a higher expected return than low-beta assets?
 10. Suppose you are deciding whether to invest $100 
million in a steel mill. You know the expected cash flows for the project, but they are risky—steel prices could rise or fall in the future. How would the CAPM help you select a discount rate for an NPV calculation?

costs when selecting an air conditioner or other major appliance? How could this selection be aided by an NPV calculation?

If he does not go to school, he will go into the workforce immediately. He will then make $30,000 per year for the next three years, $45,000 for the following three

If P&G or Kimberly-Clark were to expand capacity by build-ing three new plants, they would not need to spend $60 million on R&D before start-up.

 11. Suppose you can buy a new Toyota Corolla for $20,000 
and sell it for $12,000 after six years. Alternatively, you can lease the car for $300 per month for three years and return it at the end of the three years. For simpli-fication, assume that lease payments are made yearly instead of monthly—i.e., that they are $3600 per year for each of three years.
 a. If the interest rate, r, is 4 percent, is it better to lease 
or buy the car?
 b. Which is better if the interest rate is 12 percent?
 c. At what interest rate would you be indifferent 
between buying and leasing the car?
 12. A consumer faces the following decision: She can buy 
a computer for $1000 and $10 per month for Internet access for three years, or she can receive a $400 rebate on the computer (so that its cost is $600) but agree to pay $25 per month for three years for Internet access. 
For simplification, assume that the consumer pays the 
access fees yearly (i.e., $10 per month = $120 per year).
 a. What should the consumer do if the interest rate is 
3 percent?
 b. What if the interest rate is 17 percent?
 c. At what interest rate will the consumer be indiffer-
ent between the two options?Part Four shows how markets can sometimes fail and 
explains how government intervention can be used to achieve economic efficiency.
Much of the analysis in the first three parts of this book has 
focused on positive questions—how consumers and firms behave and how that behavior affects different market structures. Part IV takes a more normative approach. Here we will describe the goal of economic efficiency, show when markets generate efficient out-comes, and explain when they fail and thus require government intervention.
Chapter 16 discusses general equilibrium analysis, in which the 
interactions among related markets are taken into account. This chapter also analyzes the conditions that are required for an econ-omy to be efficient and shows when and why a perfectly competi-tive market is efficient. Chapter 17 examines an important source of market failure—incomplete information. We show that when some economic participants have better information than others, markets may fail to allocate goods efficiently or may not even exist. We also show how sellers can avoid problems of asymmetric infor-mation by giving potential buyers signals about product quality. Finally, Chapter 18 discusses two additional sources of market fail-ure: externalities and public goods. We show that although these failures can sometimes be resolved through private bargaining, at other times they require government intervention. We also discuss a number of remedies for market failures, such as pollution taxes and tradeable emission permits.16

For the most part, we have studied individual markets in  isolation. 
But markets are often interdependent: Conditions in one can affect prices and outputs in others either because one good is an 
input to the production of another good or because two goods are sub-stitutes or complements. In this chapter, we see how a general equilib-
rium analysis  can be used to take these interrelationships into account.
We also expand the concept of economic efficiency that we intro-
duced in Chapter 9, and we discuss the benefits of a competitive mar-ket economy. To do this, we first analyze economic efficiency, begin-ning with the exchange of goods among people or countries. We then use this analysis of exchange to discuss whether the outcomes gener-ated by an economy are equitable. To the extent that these outcomes are deemed inequitable, government can help redistribute income.
We then go on to describe the conditions that an economy must sat-
isfy if it is to produce and distribute goods efficiently. We explain why a perfectly competitive market system satisfies those conditions. We also show why free international trade can expand the production pos-sibilities of a country and make its consumers better off. Most markets, however, are not perfectly competitive, and many deviate substan-tially from that ideal. In the final section of the chapter (as a preview to our detailed discussion of market failure in Chapters 17 and 18), we discuss some key reasons why markets may fail to work efficiently.
16.1  General Equilibrium Analysis
So far, our discussions of market behavior have been largely based on partial equilibrium analysis.  When determining the equilibrium 
prices and quantities in a market using partial equilibrium  analysis,  we presume that activity in one market has little or no effect on other markets. For example, in Chapters 2 and 9, we presumed that the wheat market was largely independent of the markets for related products, such as corn and soybeans.16.1

Often a partial equilibrium analysis is sufficient to understand market behav-
ior. However, market interrelationships can be important. In Chapter 2, for example, we saw how a change in the price of one good can affect the demand for another if they are complements or substitutes. In Chapter 8, we saw that an increase in a firm’s input demand can cause both the market price of the input and the product price to rise.
Unlike partial equilibrium analysis, general equilibrium analysis  determines 
the prices and quantities in all markets simultaneously , and it explicitly takes feedback 
effects into account. A feedback effect  is a price or quantity adjustment in one mar-
ket caused by price and quantity adjustments in related markets. Suppose, for example, that the U.S. government taxes oil imports. This policy would immedi-ately shift the supply curve for oil to the left (by making foreign oil more expen-sive) and raise the price of oil. But the effect of the tax would not end there. The higher price of oil would increase the demand for and then the price of  natural gas. The higher natural gas price would in turn cause oil demand to rise (shift to the right) and increase the oil price even more. The oil and natural gas markets will continue to interact until eventually an equilibrium is reached in which the quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equated in both markets.
In practice, a complete general equilibrium analysis, which evaluates the 
effects of a change in one market on all other markets, is not feasible. Instead, we 
confine ourselves to two or three markets that are closely related. For example, when looking at a tax on oil, we might also look at markets for natural gas, coal, and electricity.
Two Interdependent Markets—Moving  
to General Equilibrium
To study the interdependence of markets, let’s examine the competitive markets 
for DVD rentals and movie theater tickets. The two markets are closely related because DVD players give most consumers the option of watching movies at home as well as at the theater. Changes in pricing policies that affect one market are likely to affect the other, which in turn causes feedback effects in the first market.
Figure 16.1 shows the supply and demand curves for DVDs and movies. In 
part (a), the price of movie tickets is initially $6.00; the market is in equilibrium at the intersection of D
M and SM. In part (b), the DVD market is also in equilib-
rium with a price of $3.00.
Now suppose that the government places a tax of $1 on each movie ticket pur-
chased. The effect of this tax is determined on a partial equilibrium basis by shift-ing the supply curve for movies upward by $1, from S
M to SM* in Figure 16.1 (a). 
Initially, this shift causes the prices of movies to increase to $6.35 and the quantity of movie tickets sold to fall from Q
M to QM=. This is as far as a partial equilibrium 
analysis takes us. But we can go further with a general equilibrium analysis by doing two things: (1) looking at the effects of the movie tax on the market for DVDs, and (2) seeing whether there are any feedback effects from the DVD mar-ket to the movie market.
The movie tax affects the market for DVDs because movies and DVDs are 
substitutes.  A higher movie price shifts the demand for DVDs from D
V to DV= 
in Figure 16.1 (b). In turn, this shift causes the rental price of DVDs to increase from $3.00 to $3.50. Note that a tax on one product can affect the prices and sales of other products—something that policymakers should remember when designing tax policies.• general equilibrium

equilibrium prices and quantities in a market independent of effects from other markets.CHAPTER 16   •  General Equilibrium and Economic Efficiency  597
What about the market for movies? The original demand curve for movies 
presumed that the price of DVDs was unchanged at $3.00. But because that price is now $3.50, the demand for movies will shift upward, from D
M to DM= in 
Figure 16.1 (a). The new equilibrium price of movies (at the intersection of SM* 
and DM=) is $6.75, instead of $6.35, and the quantity of movie tickets purchased 
has increased from QM= to QM==. Thus a partial equilibrium analysis would have 
underestimated the effect of the tax on the price of movies. The DVD market is so closely related to the market for movies that to determine the tax’s full effect, we need a general equilibrium analysis.
Reaching General Equilibrium
Our analysis is not yet complete. The change in the market price of movies will generate a feedback effect on the price of DVDs that, in turn, will affect the price of movies, and so on. In the end, we must determine the equilibrium prices and quantities of both movies and DVDs simultaneously.  The equilibrium movie price 
of $6.82 is given in Figure 16.1 (a) by the intersection of the equilibrium supply and demand curves for movie tickets ( S
M* and DM*). The equilibrium DVD price 
of $3.58 is given in Figure 16.1 (b) by the intersection of the equilibrium sup-ply and demand curves for DVDs ( S
V and DV*). These are the correct general 
equilibrium prices because the DVD market supply and demand curves have Price

TWO INTERDEPENDENT MARKETS: (A) MOVIE TICKETS AND (B) DVD RENTALS
When markets are interdependent, the prices of all products must be simultaneously determined. 
Here a tax on movie tickets shifts the supply of movies upward from SM to SM*, as shown in (a). The 
higher price of movie tickets ($6.35 rather than $6.00) initially shifts the demand for DVDs upward (from D
V to DV=), causing the price of DVDs to rise (from $3.00 to $3.50), as shown in (b). The higher 
video price feeds back into the movie ticket market, causing demand to shift from DM to DM= and the 
price of movies to increase from $6.35 to $6.75. This continues until a general equilibrium is reached, as shown at the intersection of 
DM* and SM* in (a), with a movie ticket of $6.82, and the intersection of 
DV* and SV in (b), with a DVD price of $3.58.598  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
been drawn on the assumption that the price of movie tickets is $6.82.  Likewise, the 
movie ticket curves have been drawn on the assumption that the price of DVDs 
is $3.58.  In other words, both sets of curves are consistent with the prices in 
related markets, and we have no reason to expect that the supply and demand curves in either market will shift further. To find the general equilibrium prices (and quantities) in practice, we must simultaneously find two prices that equate quantity demanded and quantity supplied in all related markets. For our two markets, we need to find the solution to four equations (supply of movie tickets, demand for movie tickets, supply of DVDs, and demand for DVDs).
Note that even if we were only interested in the market for movies, it would 
be important to account for the DVD market when determining the impact of a movie tax. In this example, partial equilibrium analysis would lead us to con-clude that the tax will increase the price of movie tickets from $6.00 to $6.35. A general equilibrium analysis, however, shows us that the impact of the tax on the price of movie tickets is greater: It would in fact increase to $6.82.
Movies and DVDs are substitute goods. By drawing diagrams analogous to 
those in Figure 16.1, you should be able to convince yourself that if the goods in question are complements , a partial equilibrium analysis will overstate  the impact 
of a tax. Think about gasoline and automobiles, for example. A tax on gasoline will cause its price to go up, but this increase will reduce demand for automo-biles, which in turn reduces the demand for gasoline, causing its price to fall somewhat.
Recall from §2.1 that two 
goods are complements if an increase in the price of one leads to a decrease in the quantity demanded of the other.
EXAMPLE 16.1  THE GLOBAL MARKET FOR ETHANOL
High crude oil prices, harmful emis-
sions, and growing dependency on volatile foreign oil supplies have led to a growing interest in alternative fuel sources such as ethanol. Ethanol is a clean-burning, high-octane fuel pro-duced from renewable resources such as sugar cane and corn. It is highly touted as a means of reducing auto-mobile emissions and of responding to concerns about global warming. There is a high degree of interdependence between the production and sale of Brazilian ethanol (from sugar cane) and ethanol produced in the United States (from corn). We will see that U.S. regulation of its ethanol market has had significant effects on the Brazilian market, which in turn has had a feedback effect on the mar-ket in the United States. Although this interdepen-dence has in all likelihood benefited U.S. producers, it has also had adverse consequences 
for U.S. consumers, Brazilian produc-ers, and, probably, Brazilian consumers.
The world ethanol market is domi-
nated by Brazil and the United States, which accounted for over 90 percent of world production in 2005.
1 Ethanol is not 
new; the Brazilian government started promoting ethanol in the mid-1970s as a response to rising oil prices and declining sugar prices, and the program has flourished. In 2007, about 40 per-cent of all Brazilian automobile fuel was ethanol, a response to the skyrocketing 
growth in the demand for flex-fuel cars, which can run on any mixture of ethanol and gasoline. U.S. ethanol production was first encouraged by the Energy Tax Act of 1978, which provided for tax exemptions for ethanol-gasoline blends. More recently, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 required that U.S. fuel production 
1This example is based on Amani Elobeid and Simla Tokgoz, “Removal of U.S. Ethanol Domestic 
and Trade Distortions: Impact on U.S. and Brazilian Ethanol Markets,” Working paper, 2006.CHAPTER 16   •  General Equilibrium and Economic Efficiency  599
include a minimum amount of renewable fuel each 
year—a stipulation which essentially mandated a baseline level of ethanol production.
The U.S. and Brazilian ethanol markets are closely 
tied to each other. As a consequence, the U.S. reg-ulation of its own ethanol market can significantly affect Brazil’s market. This global interdependence was made evident by the Energy Security Act of 1979, by which the U.S. offered a tax credit of $0.51 per gallon of ethanol to spur alternatives to gaso-line. Moreover, to prevent foreign ethanol produc-ers from reaping the benefits of this tax credit, the U.S. government imposed a $0.54 per gallon tax on imported ethanol. The policy has been highly effec-tive: The U.S. has devoted more and more of its corn harvest to ethanol production, while Brazilian imports 
(which are made from sugar cane) have declined. While this policy has benefited corn producers, it is not in the interests of U.S. ethanol consumers. It is estimated that whereas Brazil can export ethanol for less than $0.90 per gallon, it costs $1.10 to produce a gallon of ethanol from Iowa corn. Thus American consumers would benefit if the tax and subsidy were removed—a move that would increase the imports of the cheaper sugar cane-based ethanol from Brazil.
Figure 16.2 shows the predicted changes in 
the ethanol market if U.S. tariffs were completely removed in 2006. The top green line in Figure 16.2 (a) estimates Brazil’s ethanol exports without U.S. tariffs in place, and the blue line represents Brazil’s 
FIGURE 16.2
REMOVING THE ETHANOL TARIFF ON BRAZILIAN EXPORTS
If U.S. tariffs on ethanol produced abroad were to be removed, Brazil would export 
much more ethanol to the United States, displacing much of the more expensive corn-based ethanol produced domestically. As a result, the price of ethanol in the U.S. would fall, benefiting U.S. consumers.Dollars per gallonU.S. Ethanol Pr ice w ith Tar iff

exports with U.S. tariffs in place. Figure 16.2 (b) 
shows the price of ethanol in the United States with and without the tariff. As you can see, Brazilian etha-nol exports would increase dramatically if the tariffs were removed and U.S. consumers will benefit. This would also be advantageous to Brazilian producers and consumers.
The adverse incentive created by U.S. tariffs 
does not tell the entire story about ethanol and interdependent markets. In 1984, Congress passed the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI)—tax legisla-tion designed to foster economic development in Caribbean countries. Under the CBI, ethanol pro-cessed in those countries, up to 60 million gallons a year, receives duty-free status. In response, Brazil has invested in several ethanol dehydration plants in the Caribbean in order to export their sugar-based ethanol to the United States without paying the 
54-cent per gallon tariff.
The U.S. government has continued to impose 
tariffs on foreign ethanol, despite the resulting economic inefficiencies. In addition, Congress increased the subsidies to U.S. corn produc-ers by raising the tax credit on ethanol. In 2011, these subsidies cost U.S. taxpayers around  
$20 billion. Why such generosity to U.S. corn pro-ducers? Because those corn producers, mostly in Iowa, have used campaign contributions and inten-sive lobbying to protect their self-interest. These policies have helped to make the United States the world’s largest ethanol supplier, despite the cost to U.S. taxpayers and consumers and the fact that Brazil produces ethanol at less than half the cost of U.S. production.
EXAMPLE 16.2  “CONTAGION” ACROSS STOCK MARKETS AROUND THE 
WORLD
Stock markets around the world tend to move 
together, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as “contagion.” For example, the 2008 financial cri-sis led to sharp stock market declines in the United States, which in turn were mirrored by stock market declines in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. This tendency of stock markets around the world to move together is illustrated by Figure 16.3, which shows the three major stock market indices in the United States (the S&P 500), the United Kingdom (the FTSE), and Germany (the DAX). The S&P includes 500 U.S. companies with the highest market value listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ. The FTSE (fondly described as the “footsie”) has 100 of the largest U.K. companies on the London Stock Exchange, and the DAX has the 30 largest German companies on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. (Each stock market index was set to 100 in 1984.) You can see that the overall pattern of stock price move-ments was the same in all three countries. Why do stock markets tend to move together?
There are two fundamental reasons, both of which 
are manifestations of general equilibrium. First, stock (and bond) markets around the world have become highly integrated. Someone in the United States, for example, can easily buy or sell stocks that are traded 
in London, Frankfurt, or elsewhere in the world. Likewise, people in Europe and Asia can buy and sell stocks most anywhere in the world. As a result, if U.S. stock prices fall sharply and become relatively cheap compared to European and Asian stocks, European and Asian investors will sell some of their stocks and buy U.S. stocks, pushing down European and Asian stock prices. Thus any external shocks that affect stock prices in one country will have the same direc-tional effect on prices in other countries.
The second reason is that economic conditions 
around the world tend to be correlated, and eco-nomic conditions are an important determinant of stock prices. (During a recession, corporate profits fall, which causes stock prices to fall.) Suppose that the United States goes into a deep recession (as it did in 2008). Then Americans will consume less and U.S. imports will fall. But U.S. imports are the exports of other countries, so those exports will fall, reducing economic output and employment in those countries. Thus a recession in the United States can lead to a recession in Europe, and vice versa. This is another effect of general equilibrium that leads to “contagion” across stock markets.CHAPTER 16   •  General Equilibrium and Economic Efficiency  601
Economic Efficiency
In Chapter 9 we saw that a competitive market is economically efficient 
because it maximizes aggregate consumer and producer surplus. This is what we normally mean when we use the term economic efficiency . But, how 
does this important concept of economic efficiency apply when we take into account the interrelationship of markets, whether open to free trade or restricted, whether market-oriented or planned, and whether highly regulated or not? Fortunately, there is a concept of economic efficiency that applies when there is no market at all, but instead people simply trade with each other. The rest of this chapter and, to some extent the remaining chap-ters in the book, address these questions about economic efficiency and eval-uate their implications.
The analysis that follows is somewhat more complex than what has gone 
before; we are now focusing on the interplay of multiple markets with mul-tiple entities competing against each other or trading with each other. Moreover, there are important equity implications that flow from the workings of com-petitive markets in general equilibrium, and we need to consider those equity issues. To avoid losing many of our readers along the way, our strategy is to build the theoretical analysis slowly and step by step.0200400600800100012001400

We will focus on two, rather than many countries (each represented by a different 
individual consumer or producer), and two, rather than many, goods and services. Furthermore, we’ll start in Section 16.2 with a model of exchange in which there is no production. (We’ll introduce production later.) We will also initially assume that the two individuals (representing two countries) have some endowment of goods (say, food and clothing), which they trade with each other. These trades are the result of bargaining, rather than competitive market outcomes, and they occur because trad-ing makes both individuals better off. We will define a new efficiency concept that is particularly useful in analyzing this kind of exchange. Later (in Section 16.4) we’ll introduce production, and in so doing revisit another efficiency concept— technical 
efficiency . You may recall that we first discussed technical efficiency in Chapter 6 
when we introduced the concept of a production function. Finally, we will move on to the analysis of the workings of competitive markets (Section 16.6). Along the way, we will pause to treat important issues relating to equity (Section 16.3) and interna-tional trade (Section 16.5). At times the models we present may seem too simplistic to inform our real-world experiences, but rest assured they can be generalized, and their implications are both broad and profound.
16.2  Efficiency in Exchange
We begin with an exchange economy,  analyzing the behavior of two consum-
ers who can trade either of two goods between themselves. (The analysis also applies to trade between two countries.) Suppose the two goods are initially allocated so that both consumers can make themselves better off by trading with each other. In this case, the initial allocation of goods is economically inefficient.
In a Pareto efficient allocation  of goods, no one can be made better off without 
making someone else worse off . The term Pareto efficiency  is named after the Italian 
economist Vilfredo Pareto, who developed the concept of efficiency in exchange. Notice, however, that Pareto efficiency is not the same as economic efficiency as we defined it in Chapter 9. With Pareto efficiency, we know that there is no way to improve the well-being of both individuals (if we improve one, it will be at the expense of the other), but we cannot be assured that this arrangement will maximize the joint welfare of both individuals.
Note that there is an equity  implication of Pareto efficiency. It may be possible 
to reallocate the goods in a way that increases the total well-being of the two indi-
viduals, but leaves one individual worse off. If we can reallocate goods so that one individual is just slightly worse off but the other individual is much, much better off, wouldn’t that be a good thing to do, even though it is not Pareto efficient? There is no simple answer to that question. Some readers might say yes, it would be a good thing to do, and other readers might say no, it wouldn’t be fair. Your own answer to this question will depend on what you think is or is not equitable.
The Advantages of Trade
As a rule, voluntary trade between two people or two countries is mutually beneficial.
2 To see how trade makes people better off, let’s look in detail at a 
two-person exchange, assuming that exchange itself is costless.In § 6.1, we explained 
that production functions describe technical efficiency as being achieved when a firm uses each combination of inputs as effectively as possible.
• exchange economy
 Market 
in which two or more consumers trade two goods among themselves.
• Pareto efficient 
allocation  Allocation of goods 
in which no one can be made better off unless someone else is made worse off.
In §3.1, we explain that the marginal rate of substitution is the maximum amount of one good that the consumer is willing to give up to obtain one unit of another good.
2There are several situations in which trade may not be advantageous. First, limited information may 
lead people to believe that trade will make them better off when in fact it will not. Second, people may be coerced into making trades, either by physical threats or by the threat of future economic reprisals. Third, as we saw in Chapter 13, barriers to free trade can sometimes provide a strategic advantage to a country.CHAPTER 16   •  General Equilibrium and Economic Efficiency  603
Suppose James and Karen have 10 units of food and 6 units of clothing 
between them. Table 16.1 shows that initially James has 7 units of food and 1 unit of clothing, and Karen 3 units of food and 5 units of clothing. To decide whether a trade would be advantageous, we need to know their preferences for food and clothing. Suppose that because Karen has a lot of clothing and little food, her marginal rate of substitution (MRS) of food for clothing is 3: To get 1 unit of food, she will give up 3 units of clothing. However, James’s MRS of food for clothing is only 1/2: He will give up only 1/2 a unit of clothing to get 1 unit of food.
There is thus room for mutually advantageous trade because James values 
clothing more highly than Karen does, whereas Karen values food more highly than James does. To get another unit of food, Karen would be willing to trade up to 3 units of clothing. But James will give up 1 unit of food for 1/2 unit of cloth-ing. The actual terms of the trade depend on the bargaining process. Among the possible outcomes are a trade of 1 unit of food by James for anywhere between 1/2 and 3 units of clothing from Karen.
Suppose Karen offers James 1 unit of clothing for 1 unit of food, and James 
agrees. Both will be better off. James will have more clothing, which he values more than food, and Karen will have more food, which she values more than clothing. Whenever two consumers’ MRSs are different, there is room for mutu-ally beneficial trade because the allocation of resources is inefficient: Trading will make both consumers better off. Conversely, to achieve economic efficiency, the two consumers’ MRSs must be equal.
This important result also holds when there are many goods and  consumers: 
An allocation of goods is efficient only if the goods are distributed so that the marginal rate of substitution between any pair of goods is the same for all consumers.
The Edgeworth Box Diagram
If trade is beneficial, which trades can occur? Which of those trades will allocate goods efficiently among customers? How much better off will consumers then be? We can answer these questions for any two-person, two-good example by using a diagram called an Edgeworth box.
Figure 16.4 shows an Edgeworth box in which the horizontal axis describes 
the number of units of food and the vertical axis the units of clothing. The length of the box is 10 units of food, the total quantity of food available; its height is 6 units of clothing, the total quantity of clothing available.
In the Edgeworth box, each point describes the market baskets of both con-
sumers. James’s holdings are read from the origin at O
J and Karen’s holdings in 
the reverse direction from the origin at OK. For example, point A represents the 
initial allocation of food and clothing. Reading on the horizontal axis from left to right at the bottom of the box, we see that James has 7 units of food; reading upward along the vertical axis on the left of the diagram, we see that he has 1 unit of clothing. For James, therefore, A represents 7F and 1C. This leaves 3F and • Edgeworth box  Diagram

5C for Karen. Karen’s allocation of food (3F) is read from right to left at the top 
of the box diagram beginning at OK; we read her allocation of clothing (5C) from 
top to bottom at the right of the box diagram.
We can also see the effect of trade between Karen and James. James gives up 
1F in exchange for 1C, moving from A to B. Karen gives up 1C and obtains 1F, 
also moving from A to B. Point B thus represents the market baskets of both 
James and Karen after the mutually beneficial trade.
Efficient Allocations
A trade from A to B thus made both Karen and James better off. But is B an 
efficient  allocation? The answer depends on whether James’s and Karen’s MRSs 
are the same at B, which depends in turn on the shape of their indifference 
curves. Figure 16.5 shows several indifference curves for both James and Karen. Because his allocations are measured from the origin O
J, James’s indifference 
curves are drawn in the usual way. But for Karen, we have rotated the indiffer-ence curves 180 degrees, so that the origin is at the upper right-hand corner of the box. Karen’s indifference curves are convex, just like James’s; we simply see them from a different perspective.
Now that we are familiar with the two sets of indifference curves, let’s exam-
ine the curves labeled U
J1 and UK1 that pass through the initial allocation at A. 
Both James’s and Karen’s MRSs give the slope of their indifference curves at A. 
James’s MRS of clothing for food is equal to 1/2, while Karen’s is 3. The shaded area between these two indifference curves represents all possible allocations of James’s

Each point in the Edgeworth box simultaneously represents James’s and Karen’s mar-

unit of clothing, and Karen 3 units of food and 5 units of clothing.CHAPTER 16   •  General Equilibrium and Economic Efficiency  605
food and clothing that would make both James and Karen better off than at A. In 
other words, it describes all possible mutually beneficial trades.
Starting at A, any trade that moved the allocation of goods outside the shaded 
area would make one of the two consumers worse off and should not occur. The move from A to B was mutually beneficial. But in Figure 16.5, B is not an effi-
cient point because indifference curves U
J2 and UK2 intersect. In this case, James’s 
and Karen’s MRSs are not the same and the allocation is not efficient. Starting at B, James would prefer to give up some food to obtain additional clothing. He 
would be willing to make any trade that left him no worse off and hopefully gave him some additional utility, and there are many trades that would do so. Karen, on the other hand, would be willing to give up some clothing to obtain more food, and there are many such trades that would make her better off. This situation illustrates an important point: Even if a trade from an inefficient allocation 
makes both people better off, the new allocation is not necessarily efficient.
Suppose that from B the additional trade is made, with James giving up 
another unit of food to obtain another unit of clothing and Karen giving up a unit of clothing for a unit of food. Point C in Figure 16.5 gives the new alloca-
tion. At C, the MRSs of both people are identical, because at point C the indif-
ference curves are tangent. Trading food for clothing and thereby moving from point B to point C has allowed James and Karen to achieve a Pareto efficient out-
come, and they will both be better off. When the indifference curves are tangent, one person cannot be made better off without making the other person worse off. Therefore, C represents an efficient allocation.
Of course, C is not the only possible efficient outcome of a bargain between 
James and Karen. For example, if James is an effective bargainer, a trade might change the allocation of goods from A to D, where indifference curve U

The Edgeworth box  illustrates the possibilities for both consumers to increase their

 tangent to indifference curve UK1. This allocation would leave Karen no worse 
off than she was at A and James much better off. And because no further trade 
is possible, D is an efficient allocation. Thus C and D are both efficient alloca-
tions, although James prefers D to C and Karen C to D. In general, it is difficult 
to predict the allocation that will be reached in a bargain because the end result depends on the bargaining abilities of the people involved.
The Contract Curve
We have seen that from an initial allocation many possible efficient allocations can be reached through mutually beneficial trade. To find all possible efficient allo-
cations of food and clothing  between Karen and James, we look for all points of 
tangency between each of their indifference curves.  Figure 16.6 shows the contract 
curve:  the curve drawn through all such efficient allocations.
The contract curve shows all allocations from which no mutually beneficial 
trade can be made. These allocations are efficient because there is no way to reallocate 
goods to make someone better off without making someone else worse off.  In Figure 16.5 
three allocations labeled E, F, and G are Pareto efficient, although each involves 
a different distribution of food and clothing, because one person could not be made better off without making someone else worse off.
Several properties of the contract curve may help us understand the concept 
of efficiency in exchange. Once a point on a contract curve, such as E, has been 
chosen, there is no way to move to another point on the contract curve, say F, 
without making one person worse off (in this case, Karen). Karen is worse off because she has less food and less clothing at F than she had at E. Without mak-ing further comparison between James’s and Karen’s preferences, we cannot • contract curve  Curve

compare allocations E and F. We simply know that both are efficient. In this 
sense, Pareto efficiency is a modest goal: It says that we should make all mutu-ally beneficial exchanges, but it does not say which exchanges are best. Pareto efficiency can be a powerful concept, however. If a change will improve effi-ciency, it is in everyone’s  self-interest to support it.
We can frequently improve efficiency even when one aspect of a proposed 
change makes someone worse off. We need only include a second change, such that the combined  set of changes leaves someone better off and no one worse 
off. Suppose, for example, that we eliminate the quota on steel imports into the United States. Although U.S. consumers would then enjoy lower prices and a greater selection of cars, some U.S. workers would lose their jobs. But what if eliminating the quota were combined with federal tax breaks and job  relocation subsidies for steelworkers? In that case, U.S. consumers would be better off (after accounting for the cost of the job subsidies) and the workers no worse off. This would increase efficiency.
Consumer Equilibrium in a Competitive Market
In a two-person exchange, the outcome can depend on the bargaining power of the two parties. Competitive markets, however, have many actual or potential buyers and sellers. As a result, each buyer and seller takes the price of the goods as fixed and decides how much to buy and sell at those prices. We can show how competitive markets lead to efficient exchange by using the Edgeworth box to mimic a competitive market. Suppose, for example, that there are many Jameses and many Karens. This allows us to think of each individual James and Karen as a price taker, even though we are working with only a two-person  
box diagram.
Figure 16.7 shows the opportunities for trade when we start at the allocation 
given by point A and when the prices of both food and clothing are equal to 1. 
(The actual prices do not matter; what matters is the price of food relative to the price of clothing.) When the prices of food and clothing are equal, each unit of food can be exchanged for 1 unit of clothing. As a result, the price line PP’ 
in the diagram, which has a slope of -1, describes all possible allocations that 
exchange can achieve.
Suppose each James decides to buy 2 units of clothing and sell 2 units of food 
in exchange. This would move each James from A to C and increase satisfaction 
from indifference curve U
J1 to UJ2. Meanwhile, each Karen buys 2 units of food 
and sells 2 units of clothing. This would move each Karen from A to C as well, 
increasing satisfaction from indifference curve UK1 to UK2.
We choose prices for the two goods so that the quantity of food demanded by 
each Karen is equal to the quantity of food that each James wishes to sell; like-wise, the quantity of clothing demanded by each James is equal to the quantity of clothing that each Karen wishes to sell. As a result, the markets for food and clothing are in equilibrium. An equilibrium is a set of prices at which the quantity 
demanded equals the quantity supplied in every market.  This is also a competitive equi-
librium  because all suppliers and demanders are price takers.
Not all prices are consistent with equilibrium. For example, if the price of 
food is 3 and the price of clothing is 1, any exchange of clothing for food must be done on a 3-to-1 basis, i.e., 3 units of clothing must be given up to obtain 1 unit of food. But then each James will be unwilling to trade any clothing to get additional food because his MRS of clothing for food is only 1/2, i.e., he would only be willing to give up 2 units of clothing for 1 unit of food. Each Karen, on the other hand, would be happy to sell clothing to get more food but has no one In §8.7, we explain that in 
a competitive equilibrium, price-taking firms maximize profit, and the price of the product is such that the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied.608  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
to trade with. The market is therefore in disequilibrium  because the quantities of 
food and clothing demanded are not equal to the quantities supplied.
This disequilibrium should be only temporary. In a competitive market, prices 
will adjust if there is excess demand  in some markets (the quantity demanded of 
one good is greater than the quantity supplied) and excess supply  in others (the 
quantity supplied is greater than the quantity demanded). In our example, each Karen’s quantity demanded for food is greater than each James’s  willingness to sell it, whereas each Karen’s willingness to trade  clothing is greater than each James’s quantity demanded. As a result of this excess quantity demanded for food and excess quantity supplied of clothing, we can expect the price of food to increase relative to the price of clothing. As the price changes, so will the quanti-ties demanded by all those in the market. Eventually, the prices will adjust until an equilibrium is reached. In our example, the price of both food and clothing might be 2; we know from the previous analysis that when the price of cloth-ing is equal to the price of food, the market will be in competitive equilibrium. (Recall that only relative prices matter; prices of 2 for clothing and food are equivalent to prices of 1 for each.)
Note the important difference between exchange with two people and an 
economy with many people. When only two people are involved, bargaining leaves the outcome indeterminate. However, when many people are involved, • excess demand  When the

COMPETITIVE EQUILIBRIUM
In a competitive market the prices of the two goods determine the terms of exchange among consumers. 
If A is the initial allocation of goods and the price line PP’ represents the ratio of prices, the competitive 
market will lead to an equilibrium at C, the point of tangency of both indifference curves. As a result, the 
competitive equilibrium is efficient.CHAPTER 16   •  General Equilibrium and Economic Efficiency  609
the prices of the goods are determined by the combined choices of demanders 
and suppliers of goods.
The Economic Efficiency of Competitive Markets
We can now understand one of the fundamental results of microeconomic anal-ysis. We can see from point C in Figure 16.7 that the allocation in a competitive 
equilibrium is Pareto efficient.  The key reason why this is so is that C must occur 
at the tangency of two indifference curves. If it does not, one of the Jameses or one of the Karens will not be achieving maximum satisfaction; he or she will be willing to trade to achieve a higher level of utility.
This result holds in an exchange framework and in a general equilibrium set-
ting in which all markets are perfectly competitive. It is the most direct way of illustrating the workings of Adam Smith’s famous invisible hand , because it tells 
us that the economy will automatically allocate resources in a Pareto efficient manner without the need for regulatory control. It is the independent actions of consumers and producers, who take prices as given, that allows markets to function in an economically efficient manner. Not surprisingly, the invisi-ble-hand result is often used as the norm against which the workings of all  real-world markets are compared. For some, the invisible hand supports the normative argument for less government intervention; they argue that markets are highly competitive. For others, the invisible hand supports a more expan-sive role for government; they reply that intervention is needed to make mar-kets more competitive.
Whatever one’s view of government intervention, most economists con-
sider the invisible-hand result important. In fact, the result that a competitive equilibrium is Pareto efficient is often described as the first theorem of welfare 
economics,  which involves the normative evaluation of markets and economic 
policy. Formally, the first theorem states the following:
If everyone trades in the competitive marketplace, all mutually beneficial 
trades will be completed and the resulting equilibrium allocation of resources will be Pareto efficient.
Let’s summarize what we know about a competitive equilibrium from the 
consumer’s perspective:
 1. Because the indifference curves are tangent, all marginal rates of substitu-
tion between consumers are equal.
 2. Because each indifference curve is tangent to the price line, each person’s 
MRS of clothing for food is equal to the ratio of the prices of the two goods.
To be as clear as possible, we will use the notation MRS
FC to denote the MRS of 
food for clothing.  Then, if PC and PF are the two prices,
 MRS FCJ=PF/PC=MRS FCK (16.1) 
To achieve a Pareto efficient allocation when there are many consumers 
(and many producers) is not easy. It can be done if all markets are perfectly • welfare economics

competitive. But efficient outcomes can also be achieved by other means—for 
example, through a centralized system in which the government allocates all goods and services. The competitive solution is often preferred because it allo-cates resources with a minimum of information. All consumers must know their own preferences and the prices they face, but they need not know what is being produced or the demands of other consumers. Other allocation methods need more information, and as a result, they become difficult and cumbersome to manage.
16.3  Equity and Efficiency
We have shown that different efficient allocations of goods are possible, and we have seen how a perfectly competitive economy generates a Pareto efficient allocation. But there are many Pareto efficient allocations, and some are likely to be more fair than others. How do we decide what is the most equitable  alloca-
tion? That is a difficult question—economists and others disagree both about how to define equity  and how to quantify it. Any such view would involve sub-
jective comparisons of utility, and reasonable people could disagree about how to make these comparisons. In this section, we discuss this general point and then illustrate it in a particular case by showing that there is no reason to believe that the allocation associated with a competitive equilibrium will be equitable.
The Utility Possibilities Frontier
Recall that every point on the contract curve in our two-person exchange economy shows the levels of utility that James and Karen can achieve. In Figure 16.8 we put the information from the Edgeworth box in a different form. James’s utility is mea-sured on the horizontal axis and Karen’s on the vertical axis. Every point in the Edgeworth box corresponds to a point in Figure 16.7 because every allocation gen-erates utility for both people. Every movement to the right in Figure 16.8 represents an increase in James’s utility, and every upward movement an increase in Karen’s.
The utility possibilities frontier  represents all allocations that are Pareto efficient.  
It shows the levels of satisfaction that are achieved when the two individuals have

The utility possibilities frontier shows the levels of satisfaction 
that each of two people achieve when they have traded to an efficient outcome on the contract curve. Points E, F, and G cor-

reached the contract curve. Point OJ is one extreme at which James has no goods 
and therefore zero utility, while point OK is the opposite extreme at which Karen 
has no goods. Because all other points on the frontier, such as E, F, and G, corre-
spond to points on the contract curve, one person cannot be made better off with-out making the other worse off. Point H, however, represents an inefficient alloca-
tion because any trade within the shaded area makes one or both parties better off. At L, both people would be better off, but L is not attainable because there is 
not enough of both goods to generate the levels of utility that the point represents.
It might seem reasonable to conclude that an allocation must be Pareto effi-
cient to be equitable. Compare point H with F and E. Both F and E are efficient, 
and (relative to H) each makes one person better off without making the other 
worse off. We might agree, therefore, that it is inequitable to James or Karen or both for an economy to yield allocation H as opposed to F or E.
But suppose H and G are the only possible allocations. Is G more equitable 
than H? Not necessarily. Compared with H, G yields more utility for James and 
less for Karen. Some people may feel that G is more equitable than H; others 
may feel the opposite. We can conclude, therefore, that one Pareto inefficient allo-
cation of resources may be more equitable than another Pareto efficient allocation.
The problem is how to define an equitable allocation. Even if we restrict our-
selves to all points on the utility possibilities frontier, we can still ask which of these points is the most equitable. The answer depends on what one thinks equity 
entails  and, therefore, on the interpersonal comparisons of utility that one is 
willing to make.
SOCIAL WELFARE FUNCTIONS  In economics, we often use a social welfare 
function  to describe the well-being of society as a whole in terms of utilities of 
individual members. A social welfare function is useful when we want to evalu-ate policies that affect some members of society differently than others.
One such function, the utilitarian , weights everyone’s utility equally and 
consequently maximizes the total utility of all members of society. Each social welfare function can be associated with a particular view about equity. But some views do not explicitly weight individual utilities and cannot therefore be represented by a social welfare function. For example, a market-oriented view argues that the outcome of the competitive market process is equitable because it rewards those who are most able and who work the hardest. If E is the com-
petitive equilibrium allocation, for example, E would be deemed to be more 
equitable than F, even though goods are less equally allocated.
When more than two people are involved, the meaning of the word equity  
becomes even more complex. The Rawlsian  view
3 considers a world in which 
people do not know in advance what their individual endowments will be. Rawls argues that, faced with a world in which you do not know your own “fate,” you would opt for a system ensuring that the least well-off person in society will be treated reasonably well. Specifically, according to Rawls, the 
most equitable allocation maximizes the utility of the least-well-off person in society.  
The Rawlsian perspective could be egalitarian —involving an equal allocation 
of goods among all members of society. But it need not be. Suppose that by rewarding more productive people more highly than less productive people, we can get the most productive people to work harder. This policy could produce more goods and services, some of which could then be reallocated to make the poorest members of society better off.• social welfare function

3See John Rawls, A Theory of Justice  (New York: Oxford University Press, 1971).612  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
The four views of equity in Table 16.2 move roughly from most to least 
egalitarian. While the egalitarian view explicitly requires equal allocations, the Rawlsian puts a heavy weight on equality (otherwise, some people would be much worse off than others). The utilitarian is likely to require some difference between the best- and worst-off members of society. Finally, the market-oriented view may lead to substantial inequality in the allocations of goods and services.
Equity and Perfect Competition
A competitive equilibrium leads to a Pareto efficient outcome that may or may not be equitable. In fact, a competitive equilibrium could occur at any point on the con-tract curve, depending on the initial allocation. Imagine, for example, that the initial allocation gave all food and clothing to Karen. This would be at O
J in Figure 16.8, 
and Karen would have no reason to trade. Point OJ would then be a competitive 
equilibrium, as would point OK and all intermediate points on the contract curve.
Because efficient allocations are not necessarily equitable, society must rely to 
some extent on government to achieve equity goals by redistributing income or goods among households. These goals can be reached through the tax system. For example, a progressive income tax whose funds are used for programs that benefit households proportionally to income will redistribute income from the wealthy to the poor. The government can also provide public services, such as medical aid to the poor (Medicaid), or it can transfer funds through such pro-grams as food stamps.
The result that a competitive equilibrium can sustain every point on the con-
tract curve is a fundamental result in microeconomics. It is important because it suggests an answer to a basic normative question: Is there a trade-off between equity and efficiency? In other words, must a society that wishes to achieve a more equitable allocation of resources necessarily operate in a manner that is Pareto efficient? The answer, which is given by the second theorem of welfare 
 economics , tells us that redistribution need not conflict with economic efficiency. 
Formally, the second theorem states the following:
If individual preferences are convex, then every Pareto efficient allocation 
(every point on the contract curve) is a competitive equilibrium for some ini-tial allocation of goods.
Literally, this theorem tells us that any equilibrium deemed to be equitable can 
be achieved by a suitable distribution of resources among individuals and that such a distribution need not in itself generate inefficiencies. Unfortunately, all programs that redistribute income in our society are economically costly. Taxes may encourage individuals to work less or cause firms to devote resources to avoiding taxes rather than to producing output. So, in effect, there is a  trade-off 
Recall from §3.1 that an 
indifference curve is convex 
if the MRS diminishes as one moves down along the curve.TABLE 16.2 FOUR VIEWS OF EQUITY
1. Egalitarian—all members of society receive equal amounts of goods

between the goals of equity and efficiency, and hard choices must be made. 
Welfare economics, which builds on the first and second theorems, provides a useful framework for debating the normative issues that surround the equity–efficiency issue in public policy.
16.4  Efficiency in Production
Having described the conditions required to achieve an efficient allocation in the exchange of two goods, we now consider the efficient use of inputs in the production process. We assume that there are fixed total supplies of two inputs, labor and capital, which are needed to produce the same two products, food and clothing. Instead of only two people, however, we now assume that many consumers own the inputs to production (including labor) and earn income by selling them. This income, in turn, is allocated between the two goods.
This framework links the various supply and demand elements of the econ-
omy. People supply inputs to production and then use the income they earn to demand and consume goods and services. When the price of one input increases, the individuals who supply a lot of that input earn more income and consume more of one of the two goods. In turn, this increases the demand for the inputs needed to produce the good and has a feedback effect on the price of those inputs. Only a general equilibrium analysis can find the prices that equate supply and demand in every market.
Input Efficiency
To see how inputs can be combined efficiently, we must find the various com-binations of inputs that can be used to produce each of the two outputs. A par-ticular allocation of inputs into the production process is technically efficient  
if the output of one good cannot be increased without decreasing the output of another good. Because technical efficiency requires the appropriate combina-tion of inputs, we will also call it input efficiency. Efficiency in production is not a new concept; in Chapter 6 we saw that a production function represents the maximum output that can be achieved with a given set of inputs. Here we extend the concept to the production of two goods rather than one.
If input markets are competitive, a point of efficient production will be 
achieved. Let’s see why. If the labor and capital markets are perfectly competi-tive, then the wage rate w will be the same in all industries. Likewise, the rental 
rate of capital r will be the same whether capital is used in the food or clothing 
industry. We know from Chapter 7 that if producers of food and clothing mini-mize production costs, they will use combinations of labor and capital so that the ratio of the marginal products of the two inputs is equal to the ratio of the input prices:
MP
L/MP K=w/r
But we also showed that the ratio of the marginal products of the two inputs is 
equal to the marginal rate of technical substitution of labor for capital MRTSLK. 
As a result,
 MRTS LK=w/r (16.2)• technical efficiency  
Condition under which firms combine inputs to produce a given output as inexpensively as possible.
In §7.3, we explain that the rental rate is the cost per year for renting a unit of capital.
In §6.3, we explain that the marginal rate of technical substitution of labor for capi-tal is the amount by which the input of capital can be reduced when one extra unit of labor is used, so that out-put remains constant.614  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
Because the MRTS is the slope of the firm’s isoquant, a competitive equilibrium 
can occur in the input market only if each producer uses labor and capital so that the slopes of the isoquants are equal to one another and to the ratio of the prices of the two inputs. As a result, the competitive equilibrium is efficient in production.
The Production Possibilities Frontier
The production possibilities frontier  shows the various combinations of food 
and clothing that can be produced with fixed inputs of labor and capital, holding technology constant. The frontier in Figure 16.9 is derived from the production contract curve. Each point on both the contract curve and the production possi-bilities frontier describes an efficiently produced level of both food and clothing.
Point O
F represents one extreme, in which only clothing is produced, and OC 
represents the other extreme, in which only food is produced. Points B, C, and D correspond to points at which both food and clothing are efficiently produced.
Point A, representing an inefficient allocation, lies inside the production 
 possibilities frontier. All points within the triangle ABC  involve the complete 
utilization of labor and capital in the production process. However, a distortion in the labor market, perhaps due to a rent-maximizing union, has caused the economy as a whole to be productively inefficient.
Where we end up on the production possibilities frontier depends on consumer 
demand for the two goods. For example, suppose consumers tend to prefer food rather than clothing. A possible competitive equilibrium occurs at D in Figure 16.8. 
On the other hand, if consumers prefer clothing to food, the competitive equilib-rium will occur on a point on the production possibilities frontier closer to O
F.
Why is the production possibilities frontier downward sloping? In order to 
produce more food efficiently, one must switch inputs from the production of clothing, which in turn lowers the clothing production level. Because all points lying within the frontier are inefficient, they are off the production contract curve.
MARGINAL RATE OF TRANSFORMATION  The production possibilities 
frontier is concave (bowed out)—i.e., its slope increases in magnitude as more food is produced. To describe this, we define the marginal rate of transforma-
tion of food for clothing (MRT) as the magnitude of the slope of the frontier at • production possibilities

each point. The MRT measures how much clothing must be given up to produce one 
 additional unit of food.  For example, the enlarged areas of Figure 16.9 show that 
at B on the frontier, the MRT is 1 because 1 unit of clothing must be given up to 
obtain 1 additional unit of food. At D, however, the MRT is 2 because 2 units of 
clothing must be given up to obtain 1 more unit of food.
Note that as we increase the production of food by moving along the produc-
tion possibilities frontier, the MRT increases.4 This increase occurs because the 
productivity of labor and capital differs depending on whether the inputs are used to produce more food or clothing. Suppose we begin at O
F, where only 
clothing is produced. Now we remove some labor and capital from clothing production, where their marginal products are relatively low, and put them into food production, where their marginal products are high. Under these circum-stances, to obtain the first unit of food, very little clothing production is lost. (The MRT is much less than 1.) But as we move along the frontier and pro-duce less clothing, the productivities of labor and capital in clothing production rise and the productivities of labor and capital in food production fall. At B, the 
 productivities are equal and the MRT is 1. Continuing along the frontier, we note that because the input productivities in clothing rise more and the produc-tivities in food decrease, the MRT becomes greater than 1.
We can also describe the shape of the production possibilities frontier in 
terms of the costs of production. At O
F, where very little clothing output is lost 
to produce additional food, the marginal cost of producing food is very low: A lot of output is produced with very little input. Conversely, the marginal cost of producing clothing is very high: It takes a lot of both inputs to produce another unit of clothing. Thus, when the MRT is low, so is the ratio of the marginal cost of producing food MC
F to the marginal cost of producing clothing MCC. In fact, 
the slope of the production possibilities frontier measures the marginal cost of producing one good relative to the marginal cost of producing the other.  The curvature of the pro-
duction possibilities frontier follows directly from the fact that the marginal cost of producing food relative to the marginal cost of producing clothing is increas-ing. At every point along the frontier, the following condition holds:
 MRT =MC
F/MC C (16.3)
At B, for example, the MRT is equal to 1. Here, when inputs are switched 
from clothing to food production, 1 unit of output is lost and 1 is gained. If the input cost of producing 1 unit of either good is $100, the ratio of the marginal costs would be $100/$100, or 1. Equation (16.3) also holds at D (and at every 
other point on the frontier). Suppose the inputs needed to produce 1 unit of food cost $160. The marginal cost of food would be $160, but the marginal cost of clothing would be only $80 ($160/2 units of clothing). As a result, the ratio of the marginal costs, 2, is equal to the MRT.
Output Efficiency
For an economy to be efficient, goods must not only be produced at minimum cost; goods must also be produced in combinations that match people’s willingness to 
pay for them.  To understand this principle, recall from Chapter 3 that the  marginal 
4The production possibilities frontier need not have a continually increasing MRT. Suppose, for 
example, that there are strong diseconomies of scale in the production of food. In that case, as inputs are moved from clothing to food production, the amount of clothing that must be given up to obtain one more unit of food will decline.616  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
rate of substitution of clothing for food (MRS) measures the consumer’s willing-
ness to pay for an additional unit of food by consuming less clothing. The mar-ginal rate of transformation measures the cost of an additional unit of food in terms of producing less clothing. An economy produces output efficiently only if, for each consumer,
 MRS =MRT (16.4)
To see why this condition is necessary for efficiency, suppose the MRT equals 
1, while the MRS equals 2. In that case, consumers are willing to give up 2 units of clothing to get 1 unit of food, but the cost of getting the additional food is only 1 unit of lost clothing. Clearly, too little food is being produced. To achieve efficiency, food production must be increased until the MRS falls and the MRT increases and the two are equal. The outcome is output efficient only when MRS =MRT 
for all pairs of goods.
Figure 16.10 shows this important output efficiency condition graphi-
cally. Here, we have superimposed one consumer’s indifference curve on the  production possibilities frontier from Figure 16.9. Note that C is the only point 
on the production possibilities frontier that maximizes the consumer’s satisfac-tion. Although all points on the production frontier are technically efficient, not all involve the most efficient production of goods from the consumer’s perspec-tive. At the point of tangency of the indifference curve and the production fron-tier, the MRS (the slope of the indifference curve) and the MRT (the slope of the production frontier) are equal.
If you were a planner in charge of managing an economy, you would face a 
difficult problem. To achieve output efficiency, you must equate the marginal rate of transformation with the consumer’s marginal rate of substitution. But if different consumers have different preferences for food and clothing, how can you decide what levels of food and clothing to produce and what amount of each to give to every consumer, so that all consumers have the same MRS? The informational and logistical costs are enormous. That is one reason why cen-trally planned economies, like that of the former Soviet Union, performed so poorly. Fortunately, a well-functioning competitive market system can achieve the same efficient outcome as an ideal managed economy.

OUTPUT EFFICIENCY
The efficient combination of outputs is produced when the 
marginal rate of transformation between the two goods (which measures the cost of producing one good relative to the other) 
is equal to the consumer’s marginal rate of substitution (which 
measures the marginal benefit of consuming one good relative to the other).CHAPTER 16   •  General Equilibrium and Economic Efficiency  617
Efficiency in Output Markets
When output markets are perfectly competitive, all consumers allocate their 
budgets so that their marginal rates of substitution between two goods are equal to the price ratio. For our two goods, food and clothing,
MRS =P
F/PC
At the same time, each profit-maximizing firm will produce its output up to the 
point at which price is equal to marginal cost. Again, for our two goods,
PF=MC F and PC=MC C
Because the marginal rate of transformation is equal to the ratio of the marginal 
costs of production, it follows that
 MRT =MC F/MC C=PF/PC=MRS (16.5)
When output and input markets are competitive, production will be output 
efficient in that the MRT is equal to the MRS. This condition is just another version of the marginal benefit–marginal cost rule discussed in Chapter 4. There we saw that consumers buy additional units of a good up to the point at which the marginal benefit of consumption is equal to the marginal cost. Here we see that the production of food and clothing is chosen so that the marginal benefit of consuming another unit of food is equal to the marginal cost of producing another unit of food; the same is true for the consumption and production of clothing.
Figure 16.11 shows that efficient competitive output markets are achieved 
when production and consumption choices are separated. Suppose the market generates a price ratio of P

will produce food and clothing at A, where the price ratio is equal to the MRT,

mize their satisfaction at the higher indifference curve U

COMPETITION AND OUTPUT EFFICIENCY
In a competitive output market, people consume to the point 
where their marginal rate of substitution is equal to the price ratio. Producers choose outputs so that the marginal rate of transformation is equal to the price ratio. Because the MRS equals the MRT, the competitive output market is efficient. Any other price ratio will lead to an excess demand for one good and an excess supply of the other.618  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
ratio PF1/PC1, producers will not produce the combination of food and clothing 
at B. Because the producer wants to produce F1 units of food, while consum-
ers want to buy F2, there will be an excess demand for food. Correspondingly, 
because consumers wish to buy C2 units of clothing while producers wish to 
sell C1, there will be an excess supply of clothing. Prices in the market will then 
adjust: The price of food will rise and that of clothing will fall. As price ratio P
F/PC increases, the price line will move along the production frontier.
An equilibrium results when the price ratio is PF*/PC* at C. In equilibrium, 
there is no way to make a consumer better off without making another con-sumer worse off. Hence, this equilibrium is Pareto efficient. Moreover, produc-ers want to sell F
* units of food and C* units of clothing; consumers want to buy 
the same amounts. At this equilibrium, the MRT and the MRS are equal again; therefore, the competitive equilibrium is output efficient.
16.5  The Gains from Free Trade
Clearly there are gains from international trade in an exchange economy. We have seen that two persons or two countries can benefit by trading to reach a point on the contract curve. However, there are additional gains from trade when the economies of two countries differ so that one country has a comparative 
advantage  in producing one good while the other has a comparative advantage 
in producing another.
Comparative Advantage
Country 1 has a  comparative advantage  over Country 2 in producing a good if the cost 
of producing that good, relative to the cost of producing other goods in 1, is lower than the cost of producing the good in 2, relative to the cost of producing other goods in 2.
5 Note that 
comparative advantage is not the same as absolute  advantage. A country has an 
absolute advantage  in producing a good if its cost is lower than the cost in another 
country. A comparative advantage, on the other hand, implies that a country’s cost, relative to the costs of other goods it produces , is lower than the other country’s.
When each of two countries has a comparative advantage, they are better 
off producing what they are best at and purchasing the rest. To see this, sup-pose that the first country, Holland, has an absolute  advantage in producing both 
cheese and wine. A worker there can produce a pound of cheese in 1 hour and a gallon of wine in 2 hours. In Italy, on the other hand, it takes a worker 6 hours • comparative advantage  
Situation in which Country 1 has an advantage over Country 2 in producing a good because the cost of producing the good in 1, relative to the cost of producing other goods in 1, is lower than the cost of producing the good in 2, relative to the cost of producing other goods in 2.
• absolute advantage

tive advantage in the production of good x if axi

to produce a pound of cheese and 3 hours to produce a gallon of wine. The pro-
duction relationships are summarized in Table 16.3.6
Holland has a comparative  advantage over Italy in producing cheese. 
Holland’s cost of cheese production (in terms of hours of labor used) is half its cost of producing wine, whereas Italy’s cost of producing cheese is twice its cost of producing wine. Likewise, Italy has a comparative advantage in producing wine, which it can produce at half the cost at which it can produce cheese.
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN NATIONS TRADE  The comparative advantage of 
each country determines what happens when they trade. The outcome will depend on the price of each good relative to the other when trade occurs. To see how this might work, suppose that with trade, one gallon of wine sells for the same price as one pound of cheese in both Holland and Italy. Suppose also that because there is full employment in both countries, the only way to increase production of wine is to take labor out of the production of cheese, and vice versa.
Without trade, Holland could, with 24 hours of labor input, produce 
24 pounds of cheese, 12 gallons of wine, or a combination of the two, such 
as 18 pounds of cheese and 3 gallons of wine. But Holland can do better. For every hour of labor, Holland can produce 1 pound of cheese, which it can trade for 1 gallon of wine; if the wine were produced at home, 2 hours of labor would be required. It is, therefore, in Holland’s interest to special-ize in the production of cheese, which it will export to Italy in exchange for wine. If, for example, Holland produced 24 pounds of cheese and traded 6, it would be able to consume 18 pounds of cheese and 6 gallons of wine—a definite improvement over the 18 pounds of cheese and 3 gallons of wine available in the absence of trade.
Italy is also better off with trade. Note that without trade, Italy can, with the 
same 24 hours of labor input, produce 4 pounds of cheese, 8 gallons of wine, or a combination of the two, such as 3 pounds of cheese and 2 gallons of wine. On the other hand, with every hour of labor, Italy can produce one-third of a gallon of wine, which it can trade for one-third of a pound of cheese. If it pro-duced cheese at home, twice as much time would be involved. Specialization in wine production, therefore, is advantageous for Italy. Suppose that Italy pro-duced 8 gallons of wine and traded 6; in that case, it would be able to consume 6 pounds of cheese and 2 gallons of wine—likewise an improvement over the 3 pounds of cheese and 2 gallons of wine available without trade.
An Expanded Production Possibilities Frontier
When there is comparative advantage, international trade has the effect of allow-ing a country to consume outside its production possibilities frontier. This can be seen graphically in Figure 16.12, which shows a production possibilities fron-tier for Holland. Suppose initially that Holland has been prevented from trading with Italy because of a protectionist trade barrier. What is the outcome of the competitive process in Holland? Production is at point A, on indifference curve 
U
1, where the MRT and the pre-trade price of wine is twice the price of cheese. 
If Holland were able to trade, it would want to export 2 pounds of cheese in exchange for 1 gallon of wine.
6This example is based on “World Trade: Jousting for Advantage,” The Economist  (September 22, 
1990): 5–40.620  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
Suppose now that the trade barrier is dropped and Holland and Italy are 
both open to trade. Suppose also that, as a result of differences in demand and costs in the two countries, trade occurs on a one-to-one basis. Holland will find it advantageous to produce at point B, the point of tangency of the 1/1 price line 
and Holland’s production possibilities frontier.
That is not the end of the story, however. Point B represents the production 
decision in Holland. (Once the trade barrier has been removed, Holland will produce less wine and more cheese domestically.) With trade, however, con-sumption will occur at point D, at which the higher indifference curve U
2 is 
tangent to the trade price line. Thus trade has the effect of expanding Holland’s consumption choices beyond its production possibilities frontier. Holland will import W
D-WB units of wine and export CB-CD units of cheese.
With trade, each country will undergo a number of important adjustments. 
As Holland imports wine, the production of domestic wine will fall, as will employment in the wine industry. Cheese production will increase, however, as will the number of jobs in that industry. Workers with job-specific skills may find it difficult to change employment. Not everyone will, therefore, gain as the result of free trade. Although consumers will clearly be better off, produc-ers of wine and workers in the wine industry are likely to be worse off, at least temporarily.Cheese

THE GAINS FROM TRADE
Without trade, production and consumption are at point A, where the price of 
wine is twice the price of cheese. With trade at a relative price of 1 cheese to 1 
wine, domestic production is now at B, while domestic consumption is at D. Free 
trade has allowed utility to increase from U1 to U2.CHAPTER 16   •  General Equilibrium and Economic Efficiency  621
EXAMPLE 16.3  TRADING TASKS AND IPOD PRODUCTION
Most people think of foreign trade as importing or 
exporting manufactured products. However, trade often involves many steps that transform raw mate-rials into finished products. At each of these steps, intermediate goods are combined with labor or machines to make part or all of finished products. For instance, workers might assemble a set of chips and other components for a computer. Thus, a typi-cal product embodies a sequence of tasks, each of which can also be traded. Where and how those tasks are performed is an important part of efficient production and trade.
7
Consider an Apple iPod. On the back, it says 
“Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China.” But this is only the beginning and end of a long sequence of tasks needed to make an iPod, as can be seen in Table 16.4.
8 Three things are of 
note. First, iPod manufacturing is a truly global undertaking. Product design occurs in one place, company management somewhere else, and actual assembly in yet a third location. This is true not only for the iPod as a whole, but also for its major  components. This “unbundling” of produc-
tion, which allows firms to use different countries’ comparative advantages in different steps of pro-duction, has been made possible by better com-munications technology and a decline in shipping costs. The United States, for instance, may have a comparative advantage in the task of product design. The designs are sent to China, which has a comparative advantage in the task of assembly. The assembled product is then shipped back to the United States, where U.S. companies perform  
distribution and retail tasks.
Second, note that most of an iPod’s compo-
nents are semi-finished products, such as storage  
or displays, rather than raw materials, such as plastic or silicon. To make production more  efficient, specialized firms design and manufac-
ture most parts. Certainly, Apple could have set up its own factories to make processors, storage, or displays, but it is more efficient to trade and make use of the production skills of other firms in other countries. For instance, Toshiba may have

a comparative advantage in making hard drives 
because of the sheer scale of its production capacity.
Finally, observe that physical parts account for 
just under half of the iPod’s retail price. As with most products, a bundle of different services is 
needed to design, develop, and distribute the iPod. The firms that perform those services—Apple included—also end up with a sizable share of the final selling price.
EXAMPLE 16.4  THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF 
SPECIAL PROTECTION
The demands for protectionist poli-
cies increased steadily during the 1980s and into the 1990s. They remain a subject of debate today, whether out of concern for trade with various Asian countries or in relation to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Protectionism can take many forms, including tariffs and quotas 
of the kind that we analyzed in Chapter 9, regulatory hurdles, subsidies to domestic producers, and controls on the use of foreign exchange. Table 16.5 highlights the findings of one study of U.S.-imposed trade restrictions.

cThese are given by triangles B and C in Figure 9.15.CHAPTER 16   •  General Equilibrium and Economic Efficiency  623
Because one of the major purposes of protectionism is to protect jobs 
in particular industries, it is not surprising that these policies create gains to producers. The costs, however, involve losses to consumers and a substantial reduction in economic efficiency. These efficiency losses are the sum of the loss of producer surplus resulting from inefficient excess domestic produc-tion and the loss of consumer surplus resulting from higher domestic prices and lower consumption.
As Table 16.5 shows, the textiles and apparel industry is the largest source 
of efficiency losses. Although there were substantial gains to producers, con-sumer losses are larger in each case. In addition, efficiency losses from excess (inefficient) domestic production of textiles and reduced domestic consump-tion of imported textile products were also large—an estimated $9.89 billion. The second largest source of inefficiency was the dairy industry, where losses amounted to $2.79 billion.
Finally, note that the efficiency cost of helping domestic producers var-
ies considerably across industries. In textiles the ratio of efficiency costs to producer gains is 22 percent and in dairy products 27 percent; only orange juice is higher (33.3 percent). However, much lower ratios apply to color televisions (3.7 percent), carbon steel (8.7 percent), and book manufactur-ing (9.5 percent). In §9.1, we explain that 
consumer surplus is the total benefit or value that con-sumers receive beyond what they pay for a good; pro-ducer surplus is the analo-gous measure for producers.
16.6   An Overview—The Efficiency of 
Competitive Markets
Our analysis of general equilibrium and economic efficiency is now complete. In 
the process, we have obtained two remarkable results. First, we have shown that for any initial allocation of resources, a competitive process of exchange among individuals, whether through exchange, input markets, or output markets, will lead to a Pareto efficient outcome. The first theorem of welfare economics tells us that a competitive system, building on the self-interested goals of consumers and producers and on the ability of market prices to convey information to both parties, will achieve a Pareto efficient allocation of resources.
Second, we have shown that with indifference curves that are convex, any 
efficient allocation of resources can be achieved by a competitive process with a suitable redistribution of those resources. Of course, there may be many Pareto efficient outcomes. But the second theorem of welfare economics tells us that under certain (admittedly ideal) conditions, issues of equity and efficiency can be treated distinctly from one another. If we are willing to put equity issues aside, then we know that there is a competitive equilibrium that maximizes con-sumer and producer surplus, i.e., is economically efficient.
Both theorems of welfare economics depend crucially on the assumption 
that markets are competitive. Unfortunately, neither of these results necessarily holds when, for some reason, markets are no longer competitive. In the next two  chapters, we will discuss ways in which markets fail and what government can do about it. Before proceeding, however, it is essential to review our understanding of the workings of the competitive process. We thus list the conditions required for economic efficiency in exchange, in input markets, and in ou tput markets. 624  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
These conditions are important; in each of these three cases, you should review 
the explanation of the conditions in this chapter and the underlying building blocks in prior chapters.
 1. Efficiency in exchange:  All allocations must lie on the exchange contract 
curve so that every consumer’s marginal rate of substitution of food for clothing is the same:
MRS
FCJ=MRS FCK
A competitive market achieves this efficient outcome because, for consum-
ers, the tangency of the budget line and the highest attainable indifference curve ensure that:
MRS FCJ=PF/PC=MRS FCK
 2. Efficiency in the use of inputs in production:  Every producer’s marginal rate 
of technical substitution of labor for capital is equal in the production of both goods:
MRTS
LKF=MRTS LKC
A competitive market achieves this technically efficient outcome because 
each producer maximizes profit by choosing labor and capital inputs so that the ratio of the input prices is equal to the marginal rate of technical substitution:
MRTS LKF=w/r=MRTS LKC
 3. Efficiency in the output market:  The mix of outputs must be chosen so that the 
marginal rate of transformation between outputs is equal to consumers’ marginal rates of substitution:
MRT
FC=MRS FC (for all consumers)
A competitive market achieves this efficient outcome because profit- 
maximizing producers increase their output to the point at which marginal cost equals price:
P
F=MC F, PC=MC C
As a result,
MRT FC=MC F/MC C=PF/PC
But consumers maximize their satisfaction in competitive markets only if
PF/PC=MRS FC (for all consumers)
Therefore,
MRS FC=MRT FCRecall from §3.3 that con-
sumer satisfaction is maxi-mized when the marginal rate of substitution of food for clothing is equal to the ratio of the price of food to that of clothing.
Recall from §7.3 that profit maximization requires that the marginal rate of techni-cal substitution of labor for capital be equal to the ratio of the wage rate to the cost of capital.
In §8.3, we explain that because a competitive firm faces a horizontal demand curve, choosing its output so that marginal cost is equal to price is profit-maximizing.CHAPTER 16   •  General Equilibrium and Economic Efficiency  625
and the output efficiency conditions are satisfied. Thus efficiency requires 
that goods be produced in combinations and at costs that match people’s willingness to pay for them.
16.7  Why Markets Fail
We can give two different interpretations of the conditions required for effi-ciency. The first stresses that competitive markets work. It also tells us that we ought to ensure that the prerequisites for competition hold, so that resources can be efficiently allocated. The second stresses that the prerequisites for competi-tion are unlikely to hold. It tells us that we ought to concentrate on ways of deal-ing with market failures. Thus far we have focused on the first interpretation. For the remainder of the book, we concentrate on the second.
Competitive markets fail for four basic reasons: market power, incomplete infor-
mation, externalities , and public goods.  We will discuss each in turn.
Market Power
We have seen that inefficiency arises when a producer or supplier of a factor 
input has market power. Suppose, for example, that the producer of food in our Edgeworth box diagram has monopoly power. It therefore chooses the output quantity at which marginal revenue (rather than price) is equal to marginal cost and sells less output at a price higher than it would charge in a competitive market. The lower output will mean a lower marginal cost of food production. Meanwhile, the freed-up production inputs will be allocated to produce clothing, whose mar-ginal cost will increase. As a result, the marginal rate of transformation will decrease because MRT
FC = MCF/MCC. We might end up, for example, at A on the production 
possibilities frontier in Figure 16.9. Producing too little food and too much clothing is an output inefficiency because firms with market power use different prices in their output decisions than consumers use in their consumption decisions.
A similar argument would apply to market power in an input market. 
Suppose that unions gave workers market power over the supply of their labor in the production of food. Too little labor would then be supplied to the food industry at too high a wage ( w
F) and too much labor to the clothing industry 
at too low a wage ( wC). In the clothing industry, the input efficiency conditions 
would be satisfied because MRTS LKC=wC/r. But in the food industry, the wage 
paid would be greater than the wage paid in the clothing industry. Therefore, 
MRTS LKF=wF/r7wC/r=MRTS LKC. The result is input inefficiency because 
efficiency requires that the marginal rates of technical substitution be equal in the production of all goods.
Incomplete Information
If consumers do not have accurate information about market prices or product quality, the market system will not operate efficiently. This lack of information may give producers an incentive to supply too much of some products and too little of others. In other cases, while some consumers may not buy a product even though they would benefit from doing so, others buy products that leave them worse off. For example, consumers may buy pills that guarantee weight loss, only to find that they have no medical value. Finally, a lack of  information In §10.2, we explain that 
a seller of a product has monopoly power if it can profitably charge a price greater than marginal cost; similarly, §10.5 explains that a buyer has monopsony power when its purchasing decision can affect the price of a good.626  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
may prevent some markets from ever developing. It may, for example, be impos-
sible to purchase certain kinds of insurance because suppliers of insurance lack adequate information about consumers likely to be at risk.
Each of these informational problems can lead to competitive market ineffi-
ciency. We will describe informational inefficiencies in detail in Chapter 17 and see whether government intervention might help to reduce them.
Externalities
The price system works efficiently because market prices convey information to both producers and consumers. Sometimes, however, market prices do not reflect the activities of either producers or consumers. There is an externality  
when a consumption or production activity has an indirect effect on other con-sumption or production activities that is not reflected directly in market prices. As we explained in Section 9.2 (page 323), the word externality  is used because 
the effects on others (whether benefits or costs) are external to the market.
Suppose, for example, that a steel plant dumps effluent in a river, thus mak-
ing a recreation site downstream unsuitable for swimming or fishing. There is an externality because the steel producer does not bear the true cost of wastewater and so uses too much wastewater to produce its steel. This externality causes an input inefficiency. If this externality prevails throughout the industry, the price of steel (which is equal to the marginal cost of production) will be lower than if the cost of production reflected the effluent cost. As a result, too much steel will be produced, and there will be an output inefficiency.
We will discuss externalities and ways to deal with them in Chapter 18.
Public Goods
The last source of market failure arises when the market fails to supply goods that many consumers value. A public good  can be made available cheaply to many 
consumers, but once it is provided to some consumers, it is very difficult to prevent others from consuming it. For example, suppose a firm is considering whether to undertake research on a new technology for which it cannot obtain a patent. Once the invention is made public, others can duplicate it. As long as it is difficult to exclude other firms from selling the product, the research will be unprofitable.
Markets therefore undersupply public goods. We will see in Chapter 18 that 
government can sometimes resolve this problem either by supplying a good itself or by altering the incentives for private firms to produce it.• public good  Nonexclusive, 
nonrival good that can be made available cheaply but which, once available, is difficult to prevent others from consuming.
EXAMPLE 16.5  INEFFICIENCY IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM
The United States spends a larger fraction of its 
GDP on health care than do most other countries. Does this mean that the U.S. health care system is less “efficient” than other health care systems? This is an important public policy question that we can clarify by taking advantage of the analysis presented in this chapter. There are two distinct efficiency issues here. First, is the U.S. health care system technically  efficient  in production, in the sense of utilizing the 
best combination of such inputs as hospital beds, physicians, nurses, and drugs to obtain better health outcomes? Second, is the United States output 
 efficient  in the provision of health care; that is, are 
the health benefits from the marginal dollar spent on health care greater than the opportunity cost of other goods and services that might be provided instead?CHAPTER 16   •  General Equilibrium and Economic Efficiency  627
We discussed the question of technical 
 efficienc y in Chapter 6. As we saw in Example 6.1, 
as more and more health care is produced, there are diminishing returns, so that even if we are on the production frontier, it will take more and more resources to eke out small gains in health out-comes (e.g., increases in life expectancy). But we saw that there is reason to believe that the health care industry is operating below the frontier, so that if inputs were used more efficiently, better health outcomes could be achieved with little or no increase in resources. For example, for every office-based physician in the United States there are 2.2 administrative workers. This is 25 percent higher than the equivalent number in the United Kingdom, 165 percent more than the Netherlands, and 215 percent more than Germany. It appears that substantially more time and expense is devoted to navigating the complex credentialing, claim reporting, verification, and billing require-ments of various insurers in the U.S. relative to other developed countries. In addition, a number of low cost, highly effective treatments seem to be under-prescribed in the United States. Beta block-
ers, for example, cost just a few cents per dose and are believed to reduce heart attack mortality by 25%, yet in some parts of the country they are rarely prescribed.
What about output efficiency ? It has been sug-
gested that the increasing fraction of income being devoted to health expenditures in the United States is evidence of inefficiency. But, as we saw in Example 3.4, this could simply reflect a strong preference for health care on the part of the U.S. population, whose incomes have generally been increasing. The study underlying that example calculated the marginal rate of substitution between health related and non-health related goods and found that as consump-tion increases, the marginal utility of consumption for non-health related goods falls quickly. As we explained, this should not be surprising; as individu-als age and their incomes increase, an extra year of life expectancy becomes much more valuable than a new car or a second home. Thus an increasing share of income devoted to health is entirely consis-tent with output efficiency.
SUMMARY
 1. Partial equilibrium analyses of markets assume that 
related markets are unaffected. General equilibrium analyses examine all markets simultaneously, taking into account feedback effects of other markets on the market being studied.
 2. An allocation is efficient when no consumer can be 
made better off by trade without making someone else worse off. When consumers make all mutually advan-tageous trades, the outcome is Pareto efficient and lies on the contract curve.
 3. A competitive equilibrium describes a set of prices and 
quantities. When each consumer chooses her most pre-ferred allocation, the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied in every market. All competitive equilibrium allocations lie on the exchange contract curve and are Pareto efficient.
 4. The utility possibilities frontier measures all efficient 
allocations in terms of the levels of utility that each of two people achieves. Although both individuals pre-fer some allocations to an inefficient allocation, not every  efficient allocation must be so preferred. Thus 
an inefficient allocation can be more equitable than an  efficient one. 5. Because a competitive equilibrium need not be equi-
table, the government may wish to help redistribute wealth from rich to poor. Because such redistribution is costly, there is some conflict between equity and  efficiency.
 6. An allocation of production inputs is technically effi-
cient if the output of one good cannot be increased without decreasing the output of another.
 7. A competitive equilibrium in input markets occurs 
when the marginal rate of technical substitution between pairs of inputs is equal to the ratio of the prices of the inputs.
 8. The production possibilities frontier measures all 
efficient allocations in terms of the levels of output that can be produced with a given combination of inputs. The marginal rate of transformation of good 1 for good 2 increases as more of good 1 and less of good 2 are produced. The marginal rate of transfor-mation is equal to the ratio of the marginal cost of producing good 1 to the marginal cost of producing good 2.
 9. Efficiency in the allocation of goods to consumers is 
achieved only when the marginal rate of  substitution 628  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
of one good for another in consumption (which is 
the same for all consumers) is equal to the marginal rate of transformation of one good for another in production.
 10. When input and output markets are perfectly com-
petitive, the marginal rate of substitution (which equals the ratio of the prices of the goods) will equal the marginal rate of transformation (which equals the ratio of the marginal costs of producing the goods). 11. Free international trade expands a country’s produc-
tion possibilities frontier. As a result, consumers are better off.
 12. Competitive markets may be inefficient for four rea-
sons. First, firms or consumers may have market power in input or output markets. Second, consumers or pro-ducers may have incomplete information and may therefore err in their consumption and production deci-sions. Third, externalities may be present. Fourth, some socially desirable public goods may not be produced.
QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW
 1. Why can feedback effects make a general equilibrium 
analysis substantially different from a partial equilib-rium analysis?
 2. In the Edgeworth box diagram, explain how one point

For most of this book, we have assumed that consumers and 
 producers have complete information about the economic vari-ables that are relevant for the choices they face. Now we will see 
what happens when some parties know more than others—i.e., when there is asymmetric information.
Asymmetric information is quite common. Frequently, a seller of a 
product knows more about its quality than the buyer does. Workers usually know their own skills and abilities better than employers. And business managers know more about their firms’ costs, competitive positions, and investment opportunities than do the firms’ owners.
Asymmetric information also explains many institutional arrange-
ments in our society. It is one reason why automobile companies offer warranties on parts and service for new cars; why firms and employ-ees sign contracts that include incentives and rewards; and why the shareholders of corporations must monitor the behavior of managers.
We begin by examining a situation in which the sellers of a product 
have better information about its quality than buyers have. We will see how this kind of asymmetric information can lead to market fail-ure. In the second section, we see how sellers can avoid some of the problems associated with asymmetric information by giving potential buyers signals about the quality of their product. Product warranties provide a type of insurance that can be helpful when buyers have less information than sellers. But as the third section shows, the purchase of insurance entails difficulties of its own when buyers have better information than sellers.
In the fourth section, we show that managers may pursue goals 
other than profit maximization when it is costly for owners of pri-vate corporations to monitor their behavior. In other words, manag-ers have better information than owners. We also show how firms can give managers an incentive to maximize profits even when monitoring their behavior is costly. Finally, we show that labor markets may oper-ate inefficiently when employees have better information about their productivity than employers have.17.1

17.1   Quality Uncertainty and the Market 
for Lemons
Suppose you bought a new car for $20,000, drove it 100 miles, and then decided 
you really didn’t want it. There was nothing wrong with the car—it performed beautifully and met all your expectations. You simply felt that you could do just as well without it and would be better off saving the money for other things. So you decide to sell the car. How much should you expect to get for it? Probably not more than $16,000—even though the car is brand new, has been driven only 100 miles, and has a warranty that is transferable to a new owner. And if you were a prospective buyer, you probably wouldn’t pay much more than $16,000 yourself.
Why does the mere fact that the car is second-hand reduce its value so much? 
To answer this question, think about your own concerns as a prospective buyer. Why, you would wonder, is this car for sale? Did the owner really change his or her mind about the car just like that, or is there something wrong with it? Is this car a “lemon”?
Used cars sell for much less than new cars because there is asymmetric infor-
mation about their quality : The seller of a used car knows much more about the 
car than the prospective buyer does. The buyer can hire a mechanic to check the car, but the seller has had experience with it and will know more about it. Furthermore, the very fact that the car is for sale indicates that it may be a “lemon”—why sell a reliable car? As a result, the prospective buyer of a used car will always be suspicious of its quality—and with good reason.
The implications of asymmetric information about product quality were first 
analyzed by George Akerlof and go far beyond the market for used cars.
1 The 
markets for insurance, financial credit, and even employment are also charac-terized by asymmetric information about product quality. To understand the implications of asymmetric information, we will start with the market for used cars and then see how the same principles apply to other markets.
The Market for Used Cars
Suppose two kinds of used cars are available—high-quality cars and low-qual-ity cars. Also suppose that both sellers and buyers can tell which kind of car is which.  
There will then be two markets, as illustrated in Figure 17.1. In part (a), S
H is 
the supply curve for high-quality cars, and DH is the demand curve. Similarly, 
SL and DL in part (b) are the supply and demand curves for low-quality cars. 
For any given price, SH lies to the left of SL because owners of high-quality cars 
are more reluctant to part with them and must receive a higher price to do so. Similarly, D
H is higher than DL because buyers are willing to pay more to get a 
high-quality car. As the figure shows, the market price for high-quality cars is $10,000, for low-quality cars $5000, and 50,000 cars of each type are sold.
In reality, the seller of a used car knows much more about its quality than a 
buyer does. (Buyers discover the quality only after they buy a car and drive it for a while.) Consider what happens, then, if sellers know the quality of cars, but buyers do not. Initially, buyers might think that the odds are 50-50 that a car will be high quality. Why? Because when both sellers and buyers know • asymmetric 
information  Situation in which 
a buyer and a seller possess different information about a transaction.
1George A. Akerlof, “The Market for ’Lemons’: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism,” 
Quarterly Journal of Economics  (August 1970): 488–500.CHAPTER 17   •  Markets with Asymmetric Information  633
the  quality, 50,000 cars of each type are sold. When making a purchase, buyers 
therefore view all cars as “medium quality,” in the sense that there is an equal chance of getting a high-quality or a low-quality car. (Of course, after buying the car and driving it for a while, they will learn its true quality.) The demand for cars perceived to be medium quality, denoted by D
M in Figure 17.1, is below 
DH but above DL. As the figure shows, these medium-quality cars will sell for 
about $7500 each. However, fewer high-quality cars (25,000) and more low-quality 
cars (75,000) will now be sold.
As consumers begin to realize that most cars sold (about three-fourths of the 
total) are low quality, their perceived demand shifts. As Figure 17.1 shows, the new perceived demand curve might be D
LM, which means that, on average, cars 
are thought to be of low to medium quality. However, the mix of cars then shifts even more heavily to low quality. As a result, the perceived demand curve shifts further to the left, pushing the mix of cars even further toward low quality. This 
shifting continues until only low-quality cars are sold.  At that point, the market price 
would be too low to bring forth any high-quality cars for sale, so consumers correctly assume that any car they buy will be low quality. As a result, the only relevant demand curve will be D
L.
The situation in Figure 17.1 is extreme. The market may come into equilib-
rium at a price that brings forth at least some high-quality cars. But the frac-
tion of high-quality cars will be smaller than it would be if consumers could identify  PH

THE MARKET FOR USED CARS
When sellers of products have better information about product quality than buyers, a “lemons problem” 
may arise in which low-quality goods drive out high-quality goods. In (a) the demand curve for high-quality 
cars is DH. However, as buyers lower their expectations about the average quality of cars on the market, 
their perceived demand shifts to DM. Likewise, in (b) the perceived demand curve for low-quality cars shifts 
from DL to DM. As a result, the quantity of high-quality cars sold falls from 50,000 to 25,000, and the quantity 
of low-quality cars sold increases from 50,000 to 75,000. Eventually, only low-quality cars are sold.634  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
 quality before making the purchase.  That is why you should expect to sell your 
brand new car, which you know  is in perfect condition, for much less than 
you paid for it. Because of asymmetric information, low-quality goods drive high-quality goods out of the market. This phenomenon, which is sometimes referred to as the  lemons problem , is an important source of market failure. It is 
worth emphasizing:
The lemons problem: With asymmetric information, low-quality goods can 
drive high-quality goods out of the market.
Implications of Asymmetric Information
Our used cars example shows how asymmetric information can result in market failure. In an ideal world of fully functioning markets, consumers would be able to choose between low-quality and high-quality cars. While some will choose low-quality cars because they cost less, others will prefer to pay more for high-quality cars. Unfortunately, consumers cannot in fact easily determine the qual-ity of a used car until after they purchase it. As a result, the price of used cars falls, and high-quality cars are driven out of the market.
Market failure arises, therefore, because there are owners of high-quality cars 
who value their cars less than potential buyers of high-quality cars. Both parties could enjoy gains from trade, but, unfortunately, buyers’ lack of information prevents this mutually beneficial trade from occurring.
ADVERSE SELECTION  Our used car scenario is a simplified illustration of an 
important problem that affects many markets—the problem of adverse selec-tion. Adverse selection  arises when products of different qualities are sold at a 
single price because buyers or sellers are not sufficiently informed to determine the true quality at the time of purchase. As a result, too much of the low-quality product and too little of the high-quality product are sold in the marketplace. Let’s look at some other examples of asymmetric information and adverse selec-tion. In doing so, we will also see how the government or private firms might respond to the problem.
THE MARKET FOR INSURANCE  Why do people over age 65 have difficulty 
buying medical insurance at almost any price? Older people do have a much higher risk of serious illness, but why doesn’t the price of insurance rise to reflect that higher risk? Again, the reason is asymmetric information. People who buy insurance know much more about their general health than any insur-ance company can hope to know, even if it insists on a medical examination. As a result, adverse selection arises, much as it does in the market for used cars. Because unhealthy people are more likely to want insurance, the proportion of unhealthy people in the pool of insured people increases. This forces the price of insurance to rise, so that more healthy people, aware of their low risks, elect not to be insured. This further increases the proportion of unhealthy people among the insured, thus forcing the price of insurance up more. The process contin-ues until most people who want to buy insurance are unhealthy. At that point, insurance becomes very expensive, or—in the extreme—insurance companies stop selling the insurance.
Adverse selection can make the operation of insurance markets problem-
atic in other ways. Suppose an insurance company wants to offer a policy for • adverse selection  Form of 
market failure resulting when products of different qualities are sold at a single price because of asymmetric information, so that too much of the low-quality product and too little of the high-quality product are sold.CHAPTER 17   •  Markets with Asymmetric Information  635
a particular event, such as an auto accident that results in property damage. It 
selects a target population—say, men under age 25—to whom it plans to  market this policy, and it estimates that the probability of an accident for people in this group is .01. However, for some of these people, the probability of having an accident is much less than .01; for others, it is much higher than .01. If the insurance company cannot distinguish between high- and low-risk men, it will base the premium on the average accident probability of .01. What will hap-pen? Those people with low probabilities of having an accident will choose not to insure, while those with high probabilities of an accident will purchase the insurance. This in turn raises the accident probability among those who choose to be insured above .01, forcing the insurance company to raise its premium. In the extreme, only those who are likely to be in an accident will choose to insure, making it impractical to sell insurance.
One solution to the problem of adverse selection is to pool risks.  For health 
insurance, the government might take on this role, as it does with the Medicare program. By providing insurance for all people over age 65, the government 
eliminates the problem of adverse selection. Likewise, insurance companies will try to avoid or at least reduce the adverse selection problem by offering group health insurance policies at places of employment. By covering all workers in a firm, whether healthy or sick, the insurance company spreads risks and thereby reduces the likelihood that large numbers of high-risk individuals will purchase insurance.
2
THE MARKET FOR CREDIT  By using a credit card, many of us borrow 
money without providing any collateral. Most credit cards allow the holder to run a debt of several thousand dollars, and many people hold several credit cards. Credit card companies earn money by charging interest on the debit balance. But how can a credit card company or bank distinguish high-quality borrowers (who pay their debts) from low-quality borrowers (who don’t)? Clearly, borrowers have better information—i.e., they know more about whether they will pay than the lender does. Again, the lemons problem arises. Low-quality borrowers are more likely than high-quality  borrowers to want credit, which forces the interest rate up, which increases the number of low-quality borrowers, which forces the interest rate up fur-ther, and so on.
In fact, credit card companies and banks can, to some extent, use computer-
ized credit histories, which they often share with one another, to distinguish low-quality from high-quality borrowers. Many people, however, think that computerized credit histories invade their privacy. Should companies be allowed to keep these credit histories and share them with other lenders?  We can’t answer this question for you, but we can point out that credit  histories perform an important function: They eliminate, or at least greatly reduce, the problem of asymmetric information and adverse  selection—a problem that might otherwise prevent credit markets from operating. Without these histories, even the creditworthy would find it extremely costly to borrow money.
2Some people argue that pooling risks is not the main justification for Medicare, because most peo-
ple’s medical histories are well established by age 65, making it feasible for insurance companies to distinguish among high-risk and low-risk individuals. Another justification for Medicare is a distributional one. After age 65, even relatively healthy people are likely to need more medical care, making insurance expensive even without asymmetric information, and many older people would not have sufficient income to purchase the insurance.636  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
The Importance of Reputation and Standardization
Asymmetric information is also present in many other markets. Here are just a 
few examples:
• Retail stores:  Will the store repair or allow you to return a defective product? 
The store knows more about its policy than you do.
• Dealers of rare stamps, coins, books, and paintings:  Are the items real or 
counterfeit? The dealer knows much more about their authenticity than  you do.
• Roofers, plumbers, and electricians:  When a roofer repairs or renovates the 
roof of your house, do you climb up to check the quality of the work?
• Restaurants:  How often do you go into the kitchen to check if the chef is using 
fresh ingredients and obeying health laws?
In all these cases, the seller knows much more about the quality of the prod-
uct than the buyer does. Unless sellers can provide information about quality to buyers, low-quality goods and services will drive out high-quality ones, and there will be market failure. Sellers of high-quality goods and services, there-fore, have a big incentive to convince consumers that their quality is indeed high. In the examples cited above, this task is performed largely by reputation.  
You shop at a particular store because it has a reputation for servicing its prod-ucts; you hire particular roofers or plumbers because they have reputations for doing good work; you go to a particular restaurant because it has a reputation for using fresh ingredients and nobody you know has become sick after eating there. Amazon and other online vendors use another model to maintain their reputation. They allow customers to rate and comment on products. The rating and commenting feature reduces the lemons problem by giving customers more information and motivating vendors to uphold their end of the bargain.
Sometimes, however, it is impossible for a business to develop a reputation. 
For example, because most of the customers of highway diners or motels go there only once or infrequently, the businesses have no opportunity to develop reputations. How, then, can they deal with the lemons problem? One way is standardization.  In your hometown, you may not prefer to eat regularly at 
McDonald’s. But a McDonald’s may look more attractive when you are driv-ing along a highway and want to stop for lunch. Why? Because McDonald’s provides a standardized product: The same ingredients are used and the same food is served in every McDonald’s anywhere in the country. Who knows? Joe’s Diner might serve better food, but at least you know  exactly what you will be 
buying at McDonald’s.
EXAMPLE 17.1  MEDICARE
Health care reform has been at the forefront of pol-icy debates in the United States and worldwide for years. A core issue in the United States is whether everyone should have health insurance, and whether participation in some kind of public or private insur-ance program should be mandatory. To understand the argument for mandatory participation, just look 
at Medicare.
Medicare was created in 1965 as a public pro-
gram that provides health insurance to all indi-viduals over age 65 and those under age 65 with certain disabilities. Medicare has been financed by CHAPTER 17   •  Markets with Asymmetric Information  637
payroll taxes, paid in part by workers and in part 
by employers. (In 2011, 1.45% was withheld from workers’ paychecks and a matching 1.45% was paid by the employers; those rates are scheduled to increase in 2013.) The central feature of Medicare is that participation is mandatory—essentially all workers are part of the program. Indeed, manda-tory participation is what makes Medicare work, and what distinguishes it from other public and private health care programs.
To see why mandatory participation is essential, 
imagine an alternative in which private insurers offer insurance policies to the elderly at a cost of $5,000 per year. Remember that there is asymmetric infor-mation: people know much more about their health, their lifestyles, and their likely health care needs in the future than insurance companies can possibly know. Now think about who will choose to buy the insurance and who will choose to forgo the $5,000 annual expense. Those seniors who have chronic diseases or for other reasons expect their health care costs to exceed $5,000 are much more likely to buy the insurance than those who are in excel-lent health and thus expect lower costs. This creates an adverse selection problem: mostly sick people will buy the insurance, which means the insurance company will be lose money and will need to raise the price of coverage, say to $7,000. But this is not a stable outcome, since only those people with 
relatively poor health who expect healthcare costs above $7,000 will buy coverage, and once again the insurance company will be in the red. Each time the insurance company raises its price, some of the healthier remaining customers will drop out, until finally only very sick people will want to buy insurance. (This was essentially the situation prior to 1965.) And what happens when some of the uninsured people get sick? Some may be wealthy enough to pay for their medical costs out of pocket. But most people are not so wealthy, and they will end up in the emergency room of their local hos-pital, which is required by law to treat them. As a result, the cost of health care for most seniors will be borne by society as a whole, in part through the subsidization of emergency room visits.
Medicare solves this adverse selection problem. 
All people over 65 participate in Medicare—those 
expecting low health care costs along with those who expect high costs. Of course, the low-cost par-ticipants are subsidizing those with high costs. But because adverse selection is not a problem with a mandatory program, the overall cost of Medicare is lower than the cost of most private insurance sys-tems. Indeed, Medicare has earned a reputation as one of the most successful and efficient public pro-grams in the United States.
EXAMPLE 17.2  LEMONS IN MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL
How can we test for the presence of a lemons market? One way is to compare the performance of products that are resold with simi-lar products that are seldom put up for resale. In a lemons market, because  purchasers of second-
hand products will have limited information, resold products should be lower in quality than products that rarely appear on the market. One such “second-hand” mar-ket was created some time ago by a change in the rules  governing contracts in major league baseball.
3Before 1976, major league 
baseball teams had the exclu-sive right to renew a player’s contract. After a 1976 ruling declared this system illegal, a new contracting arrangement was created. After six years of major league service, players can now sign new contracts with 
their original teams or become free agents and sign with new teams. The availability of many free agents creates a second-hand market in baseball players.
3This example is based on Kenneth Lehn’s study of the free-agent market. See “Information 
Asymmetries in Baseball’s Free-Agent Market,” Economic Inquiry  (1984): 37–44.638  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
17.2  Market Signaling
We have seen that asymmetric information can sometimes lead to a lemons prob-
lem: Because sellers know more about the quality of a good than buyers do, buy-ers may assume that quality is low, causing price to fall and only low-quality goods to be sold. We also saw how government intervention (in the market for health insurance, for example) or the development of a reputation (in service industries, for example) can alleviate this problem. Now we will examine another important mechanism through which sellers and buyers deal with the problem of asymmetric information: market signaling.  The concept of market signaling 
was first developed by Michael Spence, who showed that in some markets, sell-ers send buyers signals  that convey information about a product’s quality.
4
To see how market signaling works, let’s look at a labor market , which is a good 
example of a market with asymmetric information. Suppose a firm is thinking about hiring some new people. The new workers (the “sellers” of labor) know • market signaling  Process 
by which sellers send signals to buyers conveying information about product quality.Asymmetric information is prominent in the 
free-agent market. One potential purchaser, the player’s original team, has better information about the player’s abilities than other teams have. If we were looking at used cars, we could test for the existence of asymmetric information by comparing their repair records. In baseball, we can compare player disability records. If players are working hard and following rigorous conditioning programs, we would expect a low probability of injury and a high probability that they will be able to perform if injured. In other words, more motivated players will spend less time on the bench owing to disabil-ities. If a lemons market exists, we would expect free agents to have higher disability rates than players who are renewed. Players may also have preexisting physical conditions which their origi-nal teams know about and which make them less desirable candidates for contract renewal. Because 
more such players would become free agents, free agents would experience higher disability rates for health reasons.
Table 17.1, which lists the post-contract perfor-
mance of all players who have signed multiyear con-tracts, makes two points. First, both free agents and renewed players have increased disability rates after signing new contracts. The disabled days per sea-son increase from an average of 4.73 to an average of 12.55. Second, the postcontract disability rates of renewed and non-renewed players are significantly different. On average, renewed players are disabled for 9.68 days, free agents for 17.23 days.
These two findings suggest that there is a lemons 
market in free agents that exists because baseball teams know their own players better than the teams with which they compete.

much more about the quality of the labor they can provide than does the firm 
(the buyer of labor). For example, they know how hard they tend to work, how responsible they are, what their skills are, and so forth. The firm will learn these things only after workers have been hired and have been working for some time.
Why don’t firms simply hire workers, see how well they work, and then fire 
those with low productivity? Because this policy is often very costly. In many countries, and in many firms in the United States, it is difficult to fire someone who has been working more than a few months. (The firm may have to show just cause or provide severance pay.) Moreover, in many jobs, workers do not become fully productive for at least six months. Before that time, considerable on-the-job training may be required, for which the firm must invest substantial resources. Thus the firm might not learn how good workers are for six months to a year. Clearly, firms would be much better off if they knew how productive potential employees were before  they hired them.
What characteristics can a firm examine to obtain information about people’s 
productivity before it hires them? Can potential employees convey information about their productivity? Dressing well for the job interview might convey some information, but even unproductive people can dress well. Dressing well is thus a weak signal —it doesn’t do much to distinguish high-productivity from low-
productivity people. To be strong, a signal must be easier for high-productivity people 
to give than for low-productivity people to give, so that high-productivity people are more likely to give it.
For example, education  is a strong signal in labor markets. A person’s educational 
level can be measured by several things—the number of years of schooling, degrees obtained, the reputation of the university or college that granted the degrees, the person’s grade-point average, and so on. Of course, education can directly and indirectly improve a person’s productivity by providing information, skills, and general knowledge that are helpful in work. But even if education did not improve 
productivity, it would still be a useful signal  of productivity because more produc-
tive people find it easier to attain high levels of education. Not  surprisingly, pro-ductive people tend to be more intelligent, more motivated, more disciplined, and more energetic and hard-working—characteristics that are also helpful in school. More productive people are therefore more likely to attain high levels of education in order to signal their productivity to firms and thereby obtain better-paying jobs.  Thus, 
firms are correct in considering education a signal of productivity.
A Simple Model of Job Market Signaling
To understand how signaling works, we will discuss a simple model.5 Let’s 
assume that there are only low-productivity workers (Group I), whose average and marginal product is 1, and high-productivity workers (Group II), whose average and marginal product is 2. Workers will be employed by competitive firms whose products sell for $10,000, and who expect an average of 10 years’ work from each employee. We also assume that half the workers in the popula-tion are in Group I and the other half in Group II, so that the average  productivity 
of all workers is 1.5. Note that the revenue expected to be generated from Group I workers is $100,000 ($10,000/year *10
 years) and from Group II workers is 
$200,000 ($20,000/year *10 years).
If firms could identify people by their productivity, they would offer them a 
wage equal to their marginal revenue product. Group I people would be paid $10,000 per year, Group II people $20,000. On the other hand, if firms could not 
5This is essentially the model developed in Spence, Market Signaling.640  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
identify productivity before they hired people, they would pay all workers an 
annual wage equal to the average productivity—$15,000. Group I people would then earn more ($15,000 instead of $10,000), at the expense of Group II people (who would earn $15,000 instead of $20,000).
Now let’s consider what can happen with signaling via education. Suppose 
all the attributes of an education (degrees earned, grade-point average, etc.) can be summarized by a single index y that represents years of higher education. All 
education involves a cost, and the higher the educational level y, the higher the 
cost. This cost includes tuition and books, the opportunity cost of foregone wages, and the psychic cost of having to work hard to obtain high grades. What is impor-tant is that the cost of education is greater for the low-productivity group than for the 
high-productivity group.  We might expect this to be the case for two reasons. First, 
low-productivity workers may simply be less studious. Second, low-productivity workers may progress more slowly through degree programs. In particular, sup-pose that for Group I people, the cost of attaining educational level y is given by
C
I(y)=$40,000 y
and the cost for Group II people is
CII(y)=$20,000 y
Now suppose (to keep things simple and to dramatize the importance of sig-
naling) that education does nothing to increase one’s productivity; its only value is as 
a signal.  Let’s see if we can find a market equilibrium in which different people 
obtain different levels of education, and in which firms look at education as a signal of productivity.
EQUILIBRIUM  Consider the following possible equilibrium. Suppose firms use this 
decision rule: Anyone with an education level of  y* or more is a Group II person and is 
offered a wage of $20,000, while anyone with an education level below  y* is a Group I person 
and is offered a wage of $10,000.  The particular level y* that the firms choose is arbi-
trary, but for this decision rule to be part of an equilibrium, firms must have identi-fied people correctly. Otherwise, the firms will want to change the rule. Will it work?
To answer this question, we must determine how much education the people 
in each group will obtain, given that firms are using this decision rule.  To do this, 
remember that education allows one to get a better-paying job. The benefit of education B(y) is the increase  in the wage associated with each level of education, 
as shown in Figure 17.2. Observe that B(y) is 0 initially, which represents the 
$100,000 base 10-year earnings that are earned without any college education. For an education level less than y*, B(y) remains 0, because 10-year earnings 
remain at the $100,000 base level. But when the education level reaches y* or 
greater, 10-year earnings increase to $200,000, increasing B(y) to $100,000.
How much education should a person obtain? Clearly the choice is between 
no education (i.e., y=0) and an education level of y*. Why? Any level of educa-
tion less than y* results in the same base earnings of $100,000. Thus there is no 
benefit from obtaining an education at a level above 0 but below y*. Similarly, 
there is no benefit from obtaining an educational level above y* because y* is 
sufficient to allow one to enjoy the higher total earnings of $200,000.
COST–BENEFIT COMPARISON  In deciding how much education to obtain, 
people compare the benefit of education with the cost. People in each group make the following cost-benefit calculation: Obtain the education level  y* if the CHAPTER 17   •  Markets with Asymmetric Information  641
benefit (i.e., the increase in earnings) is at least as large as the cost of this education.  For 
both groups, the benefit (the increase in earnings) is $100,000. The costs, how-ever, differ. For Group I, the cost is $40,000 y, but for Group II it is only $20,000 y. 
Therefore, Group I will obtain no education as long as
$100,000 6$40,000 y* or y*72.5
and Group II will obtain an education level y* as long as
$100,000 7$20,000 y*
 or y*65
These results give us an equilibrium as long as y * is between 2.5 and 5.  Suppose, 
for example, that y* is 4.0, as in Figure 17.2. In that case, people in Group I will 
find that education does not pay and will not obtain any, whereas people in Group II will find that education does pay and will obtain the level y=4.0. Now, 
when a firm interviews job candidates who have no college education, it correctly assumes they have low productivity and offers them a wage of $10,000. Similarly, when the firm interviews people who have four years of college, it correctly assumes their productivity is high, warranting a wage of $20,000. We therefore have an equilibrium. High-productivity people will obtain a college education to signal their productivity; firms will read this signal and offer them a high wage.Years of

SIGNALING
Education can be a useful signal of the high productivity of a group of workers if education is easier to obtain for this 
group than for a low-productivity group. In (a), the low-productivity group will choose an education level of y=0 
 because the cost of education is greater than the increased earnings resulting from education. However, in (b), the 
high-productivity group will choose an education level of y*=4 because the gain in earnings is greater than the cost.642  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
This is a highly simplified model, but it illustrates a significant point: 
Education can be an important signal that allows firms to sort workers accord-ing to productivity. Some workers (those with high productivity) will want to obtain a college education even if that education does nothing to increase their pro-
ductivity.  These workers simply want to identify themselves as highly produc-
tive, so they obtain the education needed to send a signal.
In the real world, of course, education does provide useful knowledge and 
does increase one’s ultimate productivity. (We wouldn’t have written this book 
if we didn’t believe that.) But education also serves a signaling function. For example, many firms insist that a prospective manager have an MBA. One rea-son is that MBAs learn economics, finance, and other useful subjects. But there is a second reason: To complete an MBA program takes intelligence, discipline, and hard work, and people with those qualities tend to be very productive.
Guarantees and Warranties
We have stressed the role of signaling in labor markets, but it can also play an important role in many other markets in which there is asymmetric information. Consider the markets for such durable goods as televisions, stereos, cameras, and refrigerators. Many firms produce these items, but some brands are more dependable than others. If consumers could not tell which brands tend to be more dependable, the better brands could not be sold for higher prices. Firms that produce a higher-quality, more dependable product must therefore make consumers aware of this difference. But how can they do it in a convincing way? The answer is guarantees and warranties.
Guarantees and warranties effectively signal product quality because an 
extensive warranty is more costly for the producer of a low-quality item than for the producer of a high-quality item. The low-quality item is more likely to require servicing under the warranty, for which the producer will have to pay. In their own self-interest, therefore, producers of low-quality items will not offer extensive warranties. Thus consumers can correctly view extensive warranties as signals of high quality and will pay more for products that offer them.
EXAMPLE 17.3  WORKING INTO THE NIGHT
Job market signaling does not end when one is hired. Even after a few years of employment, a worker will still know more about his abilities than will the employer. This is espe-cially true for workers in knowledge-based fields such as engineering, computer programming, finance, law, management, and consulting. Although an unusually talented com-puter programmer, for example, will be more skilled than his co-workers at writing programs that are efficient and bug-free, it may take several years before the firm fully  recognizes this talent. Given this asymmet-
ric information, what policy should employers use to determine pro-motions and salary increases? Can workers who are unusually talented and productive signal this fact and thereby receive earlier promotions and larger salary increases?
Workers can often signal talent 
and productivity by working harder 
and longer hours.  Because more tal-
ented and productive workers tend to get more enjoyment and satisfac-tion from their jobs, it is less costly for them to send this signal than it is for 
CHAPTER 17   •  Markets with Asymmetric Information  643
17.3  Moral Hazard
When one party is fully insured and cannot be accurately monitored by an 
insurance company with limited information, the insured party may take an action that increases the likelihood that an accident or an injury will occur. For example, if my home is fully insured against theft, I may be less diligent about locking doors when I leave, and I may choose not to install an alarm system. The possibility that an individual’s behavior may change because she has insurance is an example of a problem known as moral hazard.
The concept of moral hazard applies not only to problems of insur-
ance, but also to problems of workers who perform below their capabilities when employers cannot monitor their behavior (“job shirking”). In general,  
moral hazard  occurs when a party whose actions are unobserved affects the 
probability or magnitude of a payment. For example, if I have complete medical insurance coverage, I may visit the doctor more often than I would if my cover-age were limited. If the insurance provider can monitor its insurees’ behavior, it can charge higher fees for those who make more claims. But if the company can-not monitor behavior, it may find its payments to be larger than expected. Under conditions of moral hazard, insurance companies may be forced to increase pre-miums for everyone or even to refuse to sell insurance at all.
• moral hazard  When a party 
whose actions are unobserved can affect the probability or magnitude of a payment associated with an event.other workers. The signal is therefore strong: It con-
veys information. As a result, employers can—and do—rely on this signal when making promotion and salary decisions.
This signalling process has affected the way 
many people work. Rather than an hourly wage, knowledge-based workers are typically paid a fixed  salary for a 35- or 40-hour week and do not receive 
overtime pay if they work additional hours. Yet such workers increasingly work well beyond their weekly schedules. Surveys by the U.S. Labor Department, for example, found that the percentage of all work-ers who toil 49 hours or more a week rose from 13 percent in 1976 to over 16 percent in 2011.
6 Many 
young lawyers, accountants, consultants, investment bankers, and computer programmers regularly work into the night and on weekends, putting in 60- or 70-hour weeks. Is it surprising that these people are working so hard? Not at all. They are trying to send signals that can greatly affect their careers.Employers rely increasingly on the signaling value 
of long hours as rapid technological change makes it harder for them to find other ways of assessing workers’ skills and productivity. A study of software engineers at the Xerox Corporation, for example, found that many people work into the night because they fear that otherwise their bosses will conclude that they are shirkers who choose the easiest assign-ments. As the bosses make clear, this fear is war-ranted: “We don’t know how to assess the value of a knowledge worker in these new technologies,” says one Xerox manager, “so we value those who work into the night.”
As corporations become more reluctant to 
offer lifetime job security, and as competition for promotion intensifies, salaried workers feel more and more pressure to work long hours. If you find yourself working 60- or 70-hour weeks, look at the bright side—the signal you’re sending is a strong one.

Consider, for example, the decisions faced by the owners of a warehouse val-
ued at $100,000 by their insurance company. Suppose that if they run a $50 fire-prevention program for their employees, the probability of a fire is .005. Without this program, the probability increases to .01. Knowing this, the insurance com-pany faces a dilemma if it cannot monitor the company’s decision to conduct a fire-prevention program. The policy that the insurance company offers cannot include a clause stating that payments will be made only if there is a fire-pre-vention program. If the program were in place, the company could insure the warehouse for a premium equal to the expected loss from a fire—an expected loss equal to .005 *$100,000 =$500. Once the insurance policy is purchased, 
however, the owners no longer have an incentive to run the program. If there is a fire, they will be fully compensated for their financial loss. Thus, if the insur-ance company sells a policy for $500, it will incur losses because the expected loss from the fire will be $1000 (.01 *$100,000).
Moral hazard is a problem not only for insurance companies. It also alters the 
ability of markets to allocate resources efficiently. In Figure 17.3, for example, D 
gives the demand for automobile driving in miles per week. The demand curve, which measures the marginal benefits of driving, is downward sloping because some people switch to alternative transportation as the cost of driving increases. Suppose that initially, the cost of driving includes the insurance cost and that insurance companies can accurately measure miles driven. In this case, there is no moral hazard and the marginal cost of driving is given by MC. Drivers know that more driving will increase their insurance premiums and so increase their total cost of driving (the cost per mile is assumed to be constant). For example, if the cost of driving is $1.50 per mile (50 cents of which is insurance cost), drivers will go 100 miles per week.
A moral hazard problem arises when insurance companies cannot monitor 
individual driving habits, so that insurance premiums do not depend on miles driven. In that case, drivers assume that any additional accident costs that they incur will be spread over a large group, with only a negligible portion accruing to each of them individually. Because their insurance premiums do not vary with the number of miles that they drive, an additional mile of transportation will cost $1.00, as shown by the marginal cost curve MC’, rather than $1.50. The number of miles driven will increase from 100 to the socially inefficient level of 140.

THE EFFECTS OF MORAL HAZARD
Moral hazard alters the ability of markets to allocate resources 
efficiently. D gives the demand for automobile driving. With no 
moral hazard, the marginal cost of transportation MC is $1.50 per mile; the driver drives 100 miles, which is the efficient amount. With moral hazard, the driver perceives the cost per mile to be 
MC=$1.00 and drives 140 miles.CHAPTER 17   •  Markets with Asymmetric Information  645
Moral hazard not only alters behavior; it also creates economic inefficiency. 
The inefficiency arises because the insured individual perceives either the cost or the benefit of the activity differently from the true social cost or benefit. In the driving example of Figure 17.3, the efficient level of driving is given by the intersection of the marginal benefit (MB) and marginal cost (MC) curves. With moral hazard, however, the individual’s perceived marginal cost (MC’) is less than actual cost, and the number of miles driven per week (140) is higher than the efficient level at which marginal benefit is equal to marginal cost (100).
8This example is based on Terence J. Centner and Michael E. Wetzstein, “Reducing Moral Hazard 
Associated with Implied Warranties of Animal Health,” American Journal of Agricultural Economics  
69 (1987): 143–50.EXAMPLE 17.4  REDUCING MORAL HAZARD: WARRANTIES 
OF ANIMAL HEALTH
For buyers of livestock, informa-
tion about the animals’ health is very important.
8 Unhealthy 
 animals gain weight more slowly 
and are less likely to reproduce. Because of asymmetric infor-mation in the livestock market  (sellers know the health of an 
animal better than buyers do), most states require warranties on the sale of livestock. Under these laws, sellers not only promise (warrant) that animals are free from hidden  diseases, but are responsible for all costs 
arising from any diseased animals.
Although warranties solve the problem of the 
seller having better information than the buyer, they also create a form of moral hazard. Guaranteeing reimbursement to the buyer for all costs associ-ated with diseased animals means that insurance rates are not tied to the level of care that buyers or their agents take to protect their livestock against disease. As a result of these warranties, livestock buyers avoid paying for early 
diagnoses of diseased livestock, and losses increase.
In response to the moral 
 hazard problem, many states 
have modified their animal war-ranty laws by requiring sellers to tell buyers whether livestock are diseased at the time of sale. Some states also require sell-
ers to comply with state and federal animal health regulations, thereby reducing disease. Beyond these measures, however, warranties that ani-mals are free from hidden disease must be in the form of explicit written or oral  guarantees to buy-
ers. Following an outbreak of Mad Cow Disease in 2003, the U.S. Department of Agriculture intro-duced the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) as a means to further reduce moral hazard. NAIS is designed to make the entire supply chain more transparent so that disease outbreaks can be traced to the responsible party.
17.4  The Principal–Agent Problem
If monitoring the productivity of workers were costless, the owners of a busi-ness would ensure that their managers and workers were working effectively. In most firms, however, owners can’t monitor everything that employees do—employees are better informed than owners. This information asymmetry creates a principal–agent problem.• principal–agent problem  
Problem arising when agents (e.g., a firm’s managers) pursue their own goals rather than the goals of principals (e.g., the firm’s owners).646  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
An agency relationship  exists whenever there is an arrangement in which one 
person’s welfare depends on what another person does. The agent  is the person 
who acts, and the principal  is the party whom the action affects. A principal–
agent problem arises when agents pursue their own goals rather than the goals of the principal.  In our example, the manager and the workers are the agents, and the 
owners of the firm are the principals. In this case, the principal-agent problem results from the fact that managers may pursue their own goals, even at the cost of lower profits for the owners.
Agency relationships are widespread in our society. For example, doctors serve 
as agents for hospitals and, as such, may select patients and do procedures which, though consistent with their personal preferences, are not necessarily consistent with the objectives of the hospital. Similarly, managers of housing properties may not maintain the property the way that the owners would like. And sometimes insured parties may be seen as agents and insurance companies as principals.
How does incomplete information and costly monitoring affect the way 
agents act? And what mechanisms can give managers the incentives to oper-ate in the owner’s interest? These questions are central to any principal–agent analysis. In this section, we study the principal–agent problem from several perspectives. First, we look at the owner–manager problem within private and public enterprises. Second, we discuss ways in which owners can use contrac-tual relationships with their employees to deal with principal–agent problems.
The Principal–Agent Problem in Private Enterprises
Most large companies are controlled by management. Individual stockholders, who are not part of management, typically own only a small percentage of the equity of these companies, and thus they have little or no power to fire managers who are performing poorly. Indeed, it is difficult or impossible for stockhold-ers to even learn much about what the managers are doing and how well they are performing. Monitoring managers is costly, and information can be expen-sive to gather. The result is that managers can often pursue their own objectives, rather than focusing on the objective of the stockholders, which is to maximize the value of the firm.
9
But, what are objectives of managers? One view is that managers are more 
concerned with growth than with profit per se: More rapid growth and larger market share provide more cash flow, which in turn allows managers to enjoy more perks. Another view emphasizes the utility that managers get from their jobs, not only from profit but also from the respect of their peers, the power to control the corporation, the fringe benefits and other perks, and long job tenure.
However, there are limitations to managers’ ability to deviate from the 
objectives of owners. First, stockholders can complain loudly when they feel that managers are behaving improperly. In exceptional cases, they can oust the current management (perhaps with the help of the board of directors, whose job it is to monitor managerial behavior). Second, a vigorous market for corpo-rate control can develop. If a takeover bid becomes more likely when the firm is poorly managed, managers will have a strong incentive to pursue the goal of profit maximization. Third, there can be a highly developed market for manag-ers. If managers who maximize profit are in great demand, they will earn high wages and so give other managers an incentive to pursue the same goal.• agent  Individual employed 
by a principal to achieve the principal’s objective.
• principal  Individual who 
employs one or more agents to achieve an objective.
9See Merritt B. Fox, Finance and Industrial Performance in a Dynamic Economy  (New York: Columbia 
University Press, 1987).CHAPTER 17   •  Markets with Asymmetric Information  647
Unfortunately, the means by which stockholders control managers’ behavior 
are limited and imperfect. Corporate takeovers may be motivated by personal and economic power, for example, instead of economic efficiency. The manage-rial labor market may also work imperfectly because top managers are  frequently near retirement and have long-term contracts. The problem of limited stockholder control shows up most dramatically in executive compensation, which has grown very rapidly over the past several decades. In 2002, a Business Week  survey of the 
365 largest U.S. companies showed that the average CEO earned $13.1 million in 2000, and executive pay has continued to increase at a double-digit rate. Even more disturbing is the fact that for the 10 public companies led by the highest-paid CEOs, there was a negative  correlation between CEO pay and company performance.
It is clear that shareholders have been unable to adequately control managers’  
behavior. What can be done to address this problem? In theory, the answer is simple: One must find mechanisms that more closely align the interests of man-agers and shareholders. In practice, however, this is likely to prove  difficult. Among those suggestions put into effect recently by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates public companies, are reforms that grant more authority to independent outside directors. Other possible reforms would tie executive pay more closely to the long-term performance of the company. 
EXAMPLE 17.5  CEO SALARIES
Washington Mutual, an upstart savings and loan company, saw incredible growth throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. A housing boom was in full swing, and the bank, led by CEO Kerry Killinger, was aggressive in pursuing new mortgages. By 2007, however, Washington Mutual was in trouble. As the housing market slumped and home values fell, it became clear that the bank had a dangerous number of sub-prime mortgages on its books. By the fall of 2008, Washington Mutual’s assets had been seized by the FDIC and sold to competitor JP Morgan Chase at the fire sale price of $1.9 billion to avert what at the time would have been the largest bank failure in U.S. history. Less than three weeks before this sale, Washington Mutual’s board of directors fired Killinger. Still, he received a severance package total-ing over $15.3 million.
10 Killinger’s successor, Alan 
Fishman, led the bank for just 17 days, but received $11.6 million in severance pay, in addition to a $7.5 million signing bonus.
11 Washington Mutual’s share-
holders were wiped out in the sale.Killinger and Fishman were not the only bankers, 
or even the only CEOs, to receive large compensa-tion packages, regardless of their performance and the health of the companies they led. CEO com-pensation has increased sharply over the past few decades. The average annual salary for production workers in the U.S. went from $18,187 in 1990 to $32,093 in 2009. But in constant dollar terms, the 2009 average salary was only $19,552 (in 1990 dol-lars), which represents only a 7.5% increase. At the same time, the average annual compensation for CEOs has grown from $2.9 million to $8.5 million, or about $5.2 million in 1990 dollars.
12 In other words, 
while production workers have seen a 7.5% increase in their real wages over the past two decades, real CEO compensation has risen nearly 80%. Why? Have top managers become more productive, or are CEOs simply becoming more effective at extracting economic rents from their companies? The answer lies in the principal–agent problem, which is at the heart of CEO salary determination.

Average CEO pay peaked at $11 million in 2005, only to decrease during the 2007–2009 recession. After 2009, it began to increase again.648  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
Reward structures that focus on profitability over a 5- to 10-year period are more 
likely to generate efficient incentives than more shortsighted reward structures. We will consider some additional solutions to this important principal–agent problem in the next section.
The Principal–Agent Problem in Public Enterprises
The principal–agent framework can also help us understand the behavior of the managers of public organizations. These managers may also be interested in power and perks, both of which can be obtained by expanding their orga-nization beyond its “efficient” level. Because it is also costly to monitor the behavior of public managers, there are no guarantees that they will produce the efficient output. Legislative checks on a government agency are not likely to be effective as long as the agency has better information about its costs than the legislature has.
Although the public sector lacks some of the market forces that keep pri-
vate managers in line, government agencies can still be effectively monitored. For years, many economists believed that 
executive compensation reflected an appropriate reward for talent. Recent evidence, however, sug-gests that managers have been able to increase their power over boards of directors and have used that power to extract compensation pack-ages that are far out of line with their performance and contributions to the growth of their firms. In essence, managers have steadily increased their ability to extract economic rents. How has this happened?
First, most boards of directors do not have the 
necessary information or independence to nego-tiate effectively with managers. Directors often  cannot monitor executives’ activities and therefore 
cannot negotiate compensation packages that are tightly linked to their performance. Furthermore, boards consist of a mix of inside members, who either are or represent top executives, and outside members, who are chosen by and are often on close terms with top executives.
13 Therefore, direc-
tors have a strong incentive to support executives in order to be  re-nominated to the board or other-
wise rewarded.
Research has shown that high levels of CEO pay 
are negatively  correlated with a firm’s accounting 
value and profitability.14 In other words, the higher 
the CEO’s pay, the lower the firm’s profitability is likely to be. In addition, CEOs with unusually high pay were more likely to stay at a company despite poor economic results. These effects are intensified at companies where the board is entrenched and shareholder rights are limited.
“Golden parachutes,” generous severance pack-
ages that CEOs can negotiate with their boards, have also come under fire recently. Some argue that such guarantees free CEOs from board and share-holder pressure to focus on short-term growth and enable them to focus instead on their firms’ long-term growth. However, it has been shown that CEOs with golden parachutes are less likely to worry about long-term growth, and—when negotiating the sale of their firm to another company—are more likely to agree to acquisition terms that hurt shareholders.

First, managers of government agencies care about more than just the size of 
their agencies. Indeed, many choose lower-paying public jobs because they are  concerned about the “public interest.” Second, much like private manag-ers, public managers are subject to the rigors of the managerial job market. If public managers are perceived to be pursuing improper objectives, their abil-ity to obtain high salaries in the future might be impaired. Third, legislatures and other government agencies perform an oversight function. For example, the Government Accounting Office and the Office of Management and Budget spend much of their energy monitoring other agencies.
At the local rather than the federal level, public managers are subject to even 
more checks. Suppose, for example, that a city transit agency has expanded bus service beyond the efficient level. Citizens can vote the transit managers out of office, or, if all else fails, use alternative transportation (or even move). Competition among agencies can be as effective as competition among private firms in constraining the behavior of managers.
EXAMPLE 17.6  MANAGERS OF NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AS AGENTS
Do the managers of nonprofit organizations have the same goals as those of for-profit orga-nizations? Are nonprofit organiza-tions more or less efficient than for-profit firms? We can get some insight into these issues by look-ing at the provision of health care. In a study of 725 hospitals, from 14 major hospital chains, researchers compared the return on investment and average costs of nonprofit and for-profit hospitals to determine if they per-formed differently.
16
The study found that the rates of return did 
indeed differ. In one year, for-profits earned an 11.6-percent return, while nonprofits earned 8.8 percent. Four years later, for-profits earned 12.7 percent and nonprofits only 7.4 percent. A straight comparison of returns and costs is not appropriate, however, because the hospitals perform different functions. For example, 24 percent of the nonprofit hospitals provide medical residency programs, as compared with only 6 percent of the for-profit hospitals. Similar differences can be found in the provision of specialty care, with 10 percent of the nonprofits having open-heart units, as compared to only 5 percent of the for-profits. 
In addition, while 43 percent of nonprofits have premature infant units, only 29 percent of the for-profits have equivalent units.
Using a statistical regres-
sion analysis, which controls for differences in the services performed, one can determine 
whether  differences in services account for the 
higher costs. The study found that after adjust-ing for services performed, the average cost of a patient day in nonprofit hospitals was 8 percent higher than in for-profit hospitals. This difference implies that the profit status of the hospital affects its performance in the way principal–agent theory predicts: Without the competitive forces faced by for-profit hospitals, nonprofit hospitals may be less cost-conscious and therefore less likely to serve appropriately as agents for their principals—namely, society at large.
Of course, nonprofit hospitals provide services 
that society may well wish to subsidize. But the added cost of running a nonprofit hospital should be considered when determining whether it should be granted tax-exempt status.

Incentives in the Principal–Agent Framework
We have seen why managers’ and owners’ objectives are likely to differ within 
the principal-agent framework. How, therefore, can owners design reward systems so that managers and workers come as close as possible to meeting owners’ goals? To answer this question, let’s study a specific problem.
A small manufacturer uses labor and machinery to produce watches. The 
owners want to maximize profit. They must rely on a machine repairperson whose effort will influence the likelihood that machines break down and thus affect the firm’s profit level. Revenue also depends on other random factors, such as the quality of parts and the reliability of other labor. As a result of high monitoring costs, the owners can neither measure the effort of the repairperson directly nor be sure that the same effort will always generate the same profit level. Table 17.2 describes these circumstances.
The table shows that the repairperson can work with either a low or high 
amount of effort. Low effort ( a=0) generates either $10,000 or $20,000 in revenue 
(with equal probability), depending on the random factors that we mentioned. We’ve labeled the lower of the two revenue levels “bad luck” and the higher level “good luck.” When the repairperson makes a high effort ( a=1), revenue will 
be either $20,000 (bad luck) or $40,000 (good luck). These numbers highlight the problem of incomplete information: When the firm’s revenue is $20,000, the own-ers cannot know whether the repairperson has made a low or high effort.
Suppose the repairperson’s goal is to maximize his wage payment less the 
cost (in terms of lost leisure and unpleasant work time) of the effort that he makes. To simplify, we’ll suppose that the cost of effort is 0 for low effort and $10,000 for high effort. (Formally, 
c=$10,000 a.)
Now we can state the principal–agent problem from the owners’ perspective. 
The owners’ goal is to maximize expected profit, given the uncertainty of outcomes and given the fact that the repairperson’s behavior cannot be monitored. The own-ers can contract to pay the repairperson for his work, but the payment scheme must be based entirely on the measurable output of the manufacturing process, not on the repairperson’s effort. To signify this link, we describe the payment scheme as w(R), stressing that payments can depend only on measured revenue.
What is the best payment scheme? And can that scheme be as effective as 
one based on effort rather than output? The best payment scheme depends on the nature of production, the degree of uncertainty, and the objectives of both owners and managers. The arrangement will not always be as effective as an ideal scheme directly tied to effort. A lack of information can lower economic efficiency because both the owners’ revenue and the repairperson’s payment may fall at the same time.
Let’s see how to design a payment scheme when the repairperson wishes to 
maximize his payment received net of the cost of effort made.
17 Suppose first 
TABLE 17.2 REVENUE FROM MAKING WATCHES
BAD LUCK GOOD LUCK
Low effort ( a=0) $10,000 $20,000
High effort (a=1) $20,000 $40,000
17We assume that because the repairperson is risk neutral, no efficiency is lost. If, however, the 
repairperson were risk averse, there would be an efficiency loss.CHAPTER 17   •  Markets with Asymmetric Information  651
that the owners offer a fixed wage payment. Any wage will do, but we can see 
things most clearly if we assume that the wage is 0. (Here, 0 could represent a wage equal to the wage paid in other comparable jobs.) Facing a wage of 0, the repairperson has no incentive to make a high level of effort. The reason is that the repairperson does not share in any of the gains that the owners enjoy from the increased effort. It follows, therefore, that a fixed  payment will lead to an inefficient outcome. When a=0 and w=0, the owner will earn an expected 
revenue of $15,000 and the repairperson a net wage of 0.
Both the owners and the repairperson will be better off if the repairperson is 
rewarded for his productive effort. Suppose, for example, that the owners offer the repairperson the following payment scheme:
If
 R=$10,000  or $20,000,  w=0
If R=$40,000,  w=$24,000  (17.1)
Under this bonus arrangement, a low effort generates no payment. A high 
effort, however, generates an expected payment of $12,000, and an expected pay-ment less the cost of effort of $12,000 -$10,000 =$2000. Under this  system, 
the repairperson will choose to make a high level of effort. This arrangement makes the owners better off than before because they get an expected revenue of $30,000 and an expected profit of $18,000.
This is not the only payment scheme that will work for the owners, however. 
Suppose they contract to have the worker participate in the following revenue-sharing arrangement. When revenues are greater than $18,000,
w=R-$18,000 (17.2)
(Otherwise the wage is zero.) In this case, if the repairperson makes a low 
effort, he receives an expected payment of $1000. But if he makes a high level of effort, his expected payment is $12,000, and his expected payment less the $10,000 cost of effort is $2000. (The owners’ profit is $18,000, as before.)
Thus, in our example, a revenue-sharing arrangement achieves the same out-
come as a bonus-payment system. In more complex situations, the incentive effects of the two types of arrangements will differ. However, the basic idea illus-trated here applies to all principal–agent problems: When it is impossible to mea-sure effort directly, an incentive structure that rewards the outcome of high levels of effort can induce agents to aim for the goals that the owners set.
*17.5   Managerial Incentives in an 
Integrated Firm
We have seen that owners and managers of firms can have asymmetric informa-
tion about demand, cost, and other variables. We’ve also seen how owners can design reward structures to encourage managers to make appropriate efforts. Now we focus our attention on firms that are integrated —that consist of several 
divisions, each with its own managers. Some firms are horizontally integrated:  
Several plants produce the same or related products. Others are also vertically 
integrated:  Upstream divisions produce materials, parts, and components that 
downstream divisions use to produce final products. Integration creates orga-nizational problems. We addressed some of these problems in the appendix • horizontal integration  
Organizational form in which several plants produce the same or related products for a firm.
• vertical integration  
Organizational form in which a firm contains several divisions, with some producing parts and components that others use to produce finished products.652  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
to Chapter 11, where we discussed transfer pricing  in the vertically integrated 
firm—that is, how the firm sets prices for parts and components that upstream divisions supply to downstream divisions. Here we will examine problems that stem from asymmetric information.
Asymmetric Information and Incentive Design  
in the Integrated Firm
In an integrated firm, division managers are likely to have better information 
about their different operating costs and production potential than central man-agement has. This asymmetric information causes two problems.
 1. How can central management elicit accurate information about divisional 
operating costs and production potential from divisional managers? This information is important because the inputs into some divisions may be the outputs of other divisions, because deliveries must be scheduled to customers, and because prices cannot be set without knowing overall  production capacity and costs.
 2. What reward or incentive structure should central management use to 
 encourage divisional managers to produce as efficiently as possible? Should they be given bonuses based on how much they produce? If so, how should they be structured?
To understand these problems, consider a firm with several plants that all 
produce the same product. Each plant’s manager has much better information about its production capacity than central management has. In order to avoid bottlenecks and to schedule deliveries reliably, central management wants to learn more about how much each plant can produce. It also wants each plant to produce as much as possible. Let’s examine ways in which central management can obtain the information it wants while also encouraging plant managers to run the plants as efficiently as possible.
One way is to give plant managers bonuses based on either the total out-
put of their plant or its operating profit. Although this approach would encourage managers to maximize output, it would penalize managers whose plants have higher costs and lower capacity. Even if these plants produced efficiently, their output and operating profit—and thus their bonuses—would be lower than those of plants with lower costs and higher capacities. Plant managers would also have no incentive to obtain and reveal accurate infor-mation about cost and capacity.
A second way is to ask managers about their costs and capacities and then 
base bonuses on how well they do relative to their answers. For example, each manager might be asked how much his or her plant can produce each year. Then at the end of the year, the manager receives a bonus based on how close the plant’s output was to this target. For example, if the manager’s estimate of the feasible production level is Q
f, the annual bonus in dollars, B, 
might be
B=10,000 -.5(Qf-Q) (17.3)
where Q is the plant’s actual output, 10,000 is the bonus when output is at capac-
ity, and .5 is a factor chosen to reduce the bonus if Q is below Qf.
Under this scheme, however, managers would have an incentive to underes-
timate  capacity. By claiming capacities below what they know to be true, they CHAPTER 17   •  Markets with Asymmetric Information  653
can more easily earn large bonuses even if they do not operate efficiently. For 
example, if a manager estimates capacity to be 18,000 rather than 20,000, and the plant actually produces only 16,000, her bonus increases from $8000 to $9000. Thus this scheme fails to elicit accurate information about capacity and does not ensure that plants will be run as efficiently as possible.
Now let’s modify this scheme. We will still ask managers how much their 
plants can feasibly produce and tie their bonuses to this estimate. However, we will use a slightly more complicated formula than the one in (17.3) to calculate the bonus:
If
 Q7Qf, B=.3Qf+.2(Q-Qf)
If Q…Qf, B=.3Qf-.5(Qf-Q) (17.4)
The parameters (.3, .2, and .5) have been chosen so that each manager has the 
incentive to reveal the true feasible production level and to make Q, the actual 
output of the plant, as large as possible.
To see that this scheme does the job, look at Figure 17.4. Assume that the true 
production limit is Q*=20,000 units per year. The bonus that the manager will 
receive if she states feasible capacity to be the true production limit is given by the line labeled Q
f=20,000. This line is continued for outputs beyond 20,000 to 
illustrate the bonus scheme but dashed to signify the infeasibility of such pro-duction. Note that the manager’s bonus is maximized when the firm produces at its limits of 20,000 units; the bonus is then $6000.
Suppose, however, that the manager reports a feasible capacity of only 10,000. 
Then the bonus is given by the line labeled Q
f=10,000. The maximum bonus 
is now $5000, which is obtained by producing an output of 20,000. But note that this is less than the bonus that the manager would receive if she correctly stated the feasible capacity to be 20,000.
The same line of argument applies when the manager exaggerates available 
capacity. If the manager states feasible capacity to be 30,000 units per year, the 
Qf  = 30,000Bonus

INCENTIVE DESIGN IN 
AN INTEGRATED FIRM
A bonus scheme can be 
 designed that gives a man-
ager the incentive to estimate  accurately the size of the plant. 
If the manager reports a fea-sible capacity of 20,000 units per year, equal to the actual capacity, then the bonus will be maximized (at $6000).654  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
bonus is given by the line Qf=30,000. The maximum bonus of $4000, which 
is achieved at an output of 20,000, is less than the bonus that she could have received by reporting feasible capacity correctly.

Applications
Because the problem of asymmetric information and incentive design comes up often in managerial settings, incentive schemes like the one described above arise in many contexts. How, for example, can managers encourage salespeople to set and reveal realistic sales targets and then work as hard as possible to meet them?
Most salespeople cover specific territories. A salesperson assigned to a 
densely populated urban territory can usually sell more product than a sales-person assigned to a sparsely populated area. The company, however, wants to reward all salespeople equitably. It also wants to give them the incentive to work as hard as possible and to report realistic sales targets, so that it can plan production and delivery schedules. Companies have always used bonuses and commissions to reward salespeople, but incentive schemes have often been poorly designed. Typically, salespeople’s commissions were proportional to their sales. This approach elicited neither accurate information about feasible sales targets nor maximum performance.
Today, companies are learning that bonus schemes like the one given by 
equation (17.4) provide better results. The salesperson can be given an array of numbers showing the bonus as a function of both the sales target (chosen by the salesperson) and the actual level of sales. (The numbers would be calculated from equation (17.4) or some similar formula.) Salespeople will quickly figure out that they do best by reporting feasible sales targets and then working as hard as possible to meet them.

17.6   Asymmetric Information in Labor 
Markets: Efficiency Wage Theory
When the labor market is competitive, all who wish to work will find jobs for 
wages equal to their marginal products. Yet most countries have substantial unemployment even though many people are aggressively seeking work. Many of the unemployed would presumably work for an even lower wage rate than that being received by employed people. Why don’t we see firms cutting wage rates, increasing employment levels, and thereby increasing profit? Can our models of competitive equilibrium explain persistent unemployment?
In this section, we show how the efficiency wage theory  can explain the 
presence of unemployment and wage discrimination.
20 We have thus far Recall from §14.1 that in a 
perfectly competitive labor market, firms hire labor to the point at which the real wage (the wage divided by the price of the product) is equal to the marginal  product of labor.

Journal of Economics  7 (Spring 1976): 251–6. There is a dynamic problem with this scheme that we 
have ignored: Managers must weigh a large bonus for good performance this year against being assigned more ambitious targets in the future. This is discussed in Martin Weitzman, “The ’Ratchet Principle’ and Performance Incentives,” Bell Journal of Economics  11 (Spring 1980): 302–8.

determined labor productivity according to workers’ abilities and firms’ 
investment in capital. Efficiency wage models recognize that labor produc-tivity also depends on the wage rate. There are various explanations for this relationship. Economists have suggested that the productivity of workers in developing countries depends on the wage rate for nutritional reasons: Better-paid workers can afford to buy more and better food and are therefore healthier and can work more productively.
A better explanation for the United States is found in the shirking model.  
Because monitoring workers is costly or impossible, firms have imperfect information about worker productivity, and there is a principal–agent prob-lem. In its simplest form, the shirking model assumes perfectly competitive markets in which all workers are equally productive and earn the same wage. Once hired, workers can either work productively or slack off (shirk). But because information about their performance is limited, workers may not get fired for shirking.
The model works as follows. If a firm pays its workers the market-clearing 
wage w*, they have an incentive to shirk. Even if they get caught and are fired 
(and they might not be), they can immediately get hired somewhere else for the same wage. Because the threat of being fired does not impose a cost on work-ers, they have no incentive to be productive. As an incentive not to shirk, a firm must offer workers a higher wage. At this higher wage, workers who are fired for shirking will face a decrease in wages when hired by another firm at w*. If the 
difference in wages is large enough, workers will be induced to be  productive, and the employer will not have a problem with shirking. The wage at which no shirking occurs is the efficiency wage.
Up to this point, we have looked at only one firm. But all firms face the prob-
lem of shirking. All firms, therefore, will offer wages greater than the market-clearing wage w*—say, w
e (efficiency wage). Does this remove the incentive for 
workers not to shirk because they will be hired at the higher wage by other firms if they get fired? No. Because all firms are offering wages greater than w*, the demand for labor is less than the market-clearing quantity, and there 
is unemployment. Consequently, workers fired for shirking will face spells of unemployment before earning w
e at another firm.
Figure 17.5 shows shirking in the labor market. The demand for labor DL is 
downward-sloping for the traditional reasons. If there were no shirking, the intersection of D
L with the supply of labor ( SL) would set the market wage at 
w*, and full employment would result ( L*). With shirking, however, individ-
ual firms are unwilling to pay w*. Rather, for every level of unemployment in 
the labor market, firms must pay some wage greater than w* to induce work-
ers to be productive. This wage is shown as the no-shirking constraint (NSC) 
curve.  This curve shows the minimum wage, for each level of unemployment, 
that workers must earn in order not to shirk. Note that the greater the level of unemployment, the smaller the difference between the efficiency wage and w*. 
Why is this so? Because with high levels of unemployment, people who shirk risk long periods of unemployment and therefore don’t need much induce-ment to be productive.
In Figure 17.5, the equilibrium wage will be at the intersection of the NSC 
curve and D
L curves, with Le workers earning we. This equilibrium occurs 
because the NSC curve gives the lowest wage that firms can pay and still dis-courage shirking. Firms need not pay more than this wage to get the number of workers they need, and they will not pay less because a lower wage will encour-age shirking. Note that the NSC curve never crosses the labor supply curve. This means that there will always be some unemployment in equilibrium.• shirking model  Principle

EXAMPLE 17.7  EFFICIENCY WAGES AT FORD MOTOR COMPANY
One of the early examples of the 
payment of efficiency wages can be 
found in the history of Ford Motor 
Company. Before 1913, automo-
bile production depended heavily 
on skilled workers. But the intro-
duction of the assembly line drasti-
cally changed the workplace. Now 
jobs demanded much less skill, 
and production depended on maintaining assembly-
line equipment. But as automobile plants changed, 
workers became increasingly disenchanted. In 1913, 
turnover at Ford was 380 percent. The following year, 
it rose to 1000 percent, and profit margins fell sharply.
Ford needed to maintain a stable workforce, 
and Henry Ford (and his business partner James 
Couzens) provided it. In 1914, when the going 
wage for a day’s work in industry averaged between 
$2 and $3, Ford introduced a pay policy of $5 a 
day. The policy was prompted by improved labor  efficiency, not generosity. The goal 
was to attract better workers who 
would stay with their jobs—and 
eventually to increase profits.
Although Henry Ford was attacked 
for it, his policy succeeded. His work-
force did become more stable, and 
the publicity helped Ford’s sales. In 
addition, because Ford had his pick 
of workers, he could hire a group that was on average 
more productive. Ford stated that the wage increase 
did in fact increase the loyalty and personal efficiency 
of his workers, and quantitative estimates support 
his statements. According to calculations by Ford’s 
chief of labor relations, productivity increased by 51 
percent. Another study found that absenteeism had 
been cut in half and discharges for cause had declined 
sharply. Thus the productivity increase more than off-
set the increase in wages. As a result, Ford’s profitabil-
ity rose from $30 million in 1914 to $60 million in 1916.
SUMMARY
1. The seller of a product often has better information 
about its quality than the buyer. Asymmetric infor-
mation of this type creates a market failure in which 
bad products tend to drive good products out of the market. Market failure can be eliminated if sellers offer 
standardized products, provide guarantees or warran-
ties, or find other ways to maintain good reputations 
for their products.Wage

UNEMPLOYMENT IN A SHIRKING MODEL
Unemployment can arise in otherwise competitive labor markets 
when employers cannot accurately monitor workers. Here, the “no 
shirking constraint” (NSC) gives the wage necessary to keep work-
ers from shirking. The firm hires Le workers (at an efficiency wage 
we higher than the market-clearing wage w*), creating L*-Le of 
unemployment.CHAPTER 17   •  Markets with Asymmetric Information  657
 2. Insurance markets frequently involve asymmetric 
information because the party buying insurance has better information about the risk involved than the insurance company. This can lead to adverse selection, in which poor risks choose to insure and good risks do not. Another problem for insurance markets is moral hazard, in which the insured takes less care to avoid losses after being insured.
 3. Sellers can deal with the problem of asymmetric infor-
mation by sending buyers signals about the quality of their products. For example, workers can signal high productivity by obtaining high levels of education.
 4. Asymmetric information may make it costly for the 
owners of firms (principals) to monitor accurately the behavior of their managers (agents). Managers may 
seek higher fringe benefits for themselves or a goal of sales maximization, even though shareholders would prefer to maximize profit.
 5. Owners can avoid some principal–agent problems by 
designing contracts that give their agents the incentive to perform productively.
 6. Asymmetric information can explain why labor 
markets have unemployment even though some workers are actively seeking work. According to efficiency wage theory, a wage higher than the com-petitive wage (the efficiency wage) increases worker productivity by discouraging workers from shirking 
on the job.

 b. You are a loan officer in a bank. After selecting a car, 
Gary comes to you seeking a loan. Because he has only recently graduated, he does not have a long credit history. Nonetheless, the bank has a long his-tory of financing cars for recent college graduates. Is this information useful in Gary’s case? If so, how? 3. A major university bans the assignment of D or F 
grades. It defends its action by claiming that students 
tend to perform above average when they are free from the pressures of flunking out. The university states that it wants all its students to get As and Bs. If the goal is to raise overall grades to the B level or above, is this a good policy? Discuss this policy with respect to the problem of moral hazard.
 4. Professor Jones has just been hired by the economics 
department at a major university. The president of the board of regents has stated that the university is com-mitted to providing top-quality education for under-graduates. Two months into the semester, Jones fails to show up for his classes. It seems he is devoting all his time to research rather than to teaching. Jones argues that his research will bring prestige to the department and the university. Should he be allowed to continue exclusively with research? Discuss with reference to the principal–agent problem.658  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government

with poor repair records, a number of American com-panies have offered extensive guarantees to car pur-chasers (e.g., a seven-year warranty on all parts and labor associated with mechanical problems).

 8. You have seen how asymmetric information can 
reduce the average quality of products sold in a mar-ket, as low-quality products drive out high-quality products. For those markets in which asymmetric information is prevalent, would you agree or disagree with each of the following? Explain briefly:
 a. The government should subsidize Consumer 
Reports.
 b. The government should impose quality standards—
e.g., firms should not be allowed to sell low-quality items.
 c. The producer of a high-quality good will probably 
want to offer an extensive warranty.
 d. The government should require all firms to offer 
extensive warranties.
 9. Two used car dealerships compete side by side on a 
main road. The first, Harry’s Cars, always sells high-
quality cars that it carefully inspects and, if neces-
sary, services. On average, it costs Harry’s $8000 to buy and service each car that it sells. The second dealership, Lew’s Motors, always sells lower-quality cars. On average, it costs Lew’s only $5000 for each car that it sells. If consumers knew the quality of the used cars they were buying, they would pay $10,000 on average for Harry’s cars and only $7000 on aver-age for Lew’s cars.
Without more information, consumers do not 
know the quality of each dealership’s cars. In this case, they would figure that they have a 50–50 chance of ending up with a high-quality car and are thus willing to pay $8500 for a car.
Harry has an idea: He will offer a bumper-to-
bumper warranty for all cars that he sells. He knows that a warranty lasting Y years will cost $500 Y on aver-
age, and he also knows that if Lew tries to offer the same warranty, it will cost Lew $1000 Y on average. a. Suppose Harry offers a one-year warranty on all of 
the cars he sells. i.  What is Lew’s profit if he does not offer a one-
year warranty? If he does offer a one-year  warranty?
 ii.  What is Harry’s profit if Lew does not offer a 
one-year warranty? If he does offer a one-year warranty?

warranty?
 b. What if Harry offers a two-year warranty? Will this 
offer generate a credible signal of quality? What about a three-year warranty?
 c. If you were advising Harry, how long a warranty 
would you urge him to offer? Explain why.

In this chapter we study externalities —the effects of production and 
consumption activities not directly reflected in the market—and public goods —goods that benefit all consumers but that the market 
either undersupplies or does not supply at all. Externalities and public goods are important sources of market failure and thus raise serious public policy questions. For example, how much waste, if any, should firms be allowed to dump into rivers and streams? How strict should automobile emission standards be? How much money should the  government spend on national defense? Education? Basic research? Public television?
When externalities are present, the price of a good need not reflect 
its social value. As a result, firms may produce too much or too little, so that the market outcome is inefficient. We begin by describing exter-nalities and showing exactly how they create market inefficiencies. We then evaluate remedies. While some remedies involve government regulation, others rely primarily on bargaining among individuals or on the legal right of those adversely affected to sue those who create an externality.
Next, we analyze public goods. The marginal cost of providing a 
public good to an additional consumer is zero, and people cannot be prevented from consuming it. We distinguish between those goods that are difficult to provide privately and those that could have been provided by the market. We conclude by describing the problem that policymakers face when trying to decide how much of a public good to provide.
18.1  Externalities
Externalities  can arise between producers, between customers, or 
between consumers and producers. They can be negative —when the 
action of one party imposes costs on another party—or positive —when 
the action of one party benefits another party.
A negative externality  occurs, for example, when a steel plant dumps 
its waste in a river that fishermen downstream depend on for their 18.1 The Costs and Benefits of

daily catch. The more waste the steel plant dumps in the river, the fewer fish 
will be supported. The firm, however, has no incentive to account for the exter-nal costs that it imposes on fishermen when making its production decision. Furthermore, there is no market in which these external costs can be reflected in the price of steel. A positive externality  occurs when a home owner repaints her 
house and plants an attractive garden. All the neighbors benefit from this activ-ity, even though the home owner’s decision to repaint and landscape probably did not take these benefits into account.
Negative Externalities and Inefficiency
Because externalities are not reflected in market prices, they can be a source of economic inefficiency. When firms do not take into account the harms associ-ated with negative externalities, the result is excess production and unnecessary social costs. To see why, let’s take our example of a steel plant dumping waste in a river. Figure 18.1 (a) shows the production decision of a steel plant in a com-petitive market. Figure 18.1 (b) shows the market demand and supply curves, assuming that all steel plants generate similar externalities. We assume that because the firm has a fixed-proportions production function, it cannot alter its input combinations; waste and other effluent can be reduced only by lower-ing output. (Without this assumption, firms would be jointly choosing among a variety of combinations of output and pollution abatement.) We will analyze the nature of the externality under two circumstances: first when only one steel plant pollutes and, second, when all steel plants pollute in the same way.
In §6.3, we explain that with 
a fixed-proportions produc-tion function, it is impossible 
to substitute among inputs 
because each level of output requires a specific combina-tion of labor and capital.• externality

EXTERNAL COST
When there are negative externalities, the marginal social cost MSC is higher than the marginal cost MC.  
The difference is the marginal external cost MEC. In (a), a profit-maximizing firm produces at q1, where price is equal 
to MC. The efficient output is q*, at which price equals MSC. In (b), the industry’s competitive output is Q1, at the 
intersection of industry supply MCI and demand D. However, the efficient output Q* is lower, at the intersection of 
demand and marginal social cost MSCI.CHAPTER 18   •  Externalities and Public Goods  663
In §8.3, we explain that 
because a competitive firm faces a horizontal demand curve, choosing its output so that marginal cost is equal to price is profit-maximizing.The price of steel is P1 at the intersection of the demand and supply curves 
in Figure 18.1 (b). The MC curve in (a) gives a typical steel firm’s marginal cost of production. The firm maximizes profit by producing output q
1, at which 
marginal cost is equal to price (which equals marginal revenue because the firm takes price as given). As the firm’s output changes, however, the external cost imposed on fishermen downstream also changes. This external cost is given by the marginal external cost  (MEC) curve in Figure 18.1 (a). It is intuitively 
clear why total external cost increases with output—there is more pollution. However, our analysis focuses on the marginal  external cost, which measures 
the added cost of the externality associated with each additional  unit of output 
produced. In practice, the MEC curve is upward sloping for most forms of pol-lution: As the firm produces additional output and dumps additional effluent, the incremental harm to the fishing industry increases.
From a social point of view, the firm produces too much output. The efficient 
level of output is the level at which the price of the product is equal to the mar-
ginal social cost  (MSC) of production: the marginal cost of production plus the 
marginal external cost of dumping effluent. In Figure 18.1 (a), the marginal social cost curve is obtained by adding marginal cost and marginal external cost for each level of output (i.e., MSC =MC+MEC ). The marginal social cost curve MSC 
intersects the price line at output q*. Because only one plant is dumping effluent 
into the river, the market price of the product is unchanged. However, the firm is producing too much output ( q
1 instead of q*) and generating too much effluent.
Now consider what happens when all steel plants dump their effluent into 
rivers. In Figure 18.1 (b), the MCI curve is the industry supply curve. The mar-
ginal external cost associated with the industry output, MECI, is obtained by 
summing the marginal cost of every person harmed at each level of output. The MSC
I curve represents the sum of the marginal cost of production and the mar-
ginal external cost for all steel firms.  As a result, MSCI=MCI+MECI.
Is industry output efficient when there are externalities? As Figure 18.1 
(b) shows, the efficient industry output level is the level at which the mar-ginal benefit of an additional unit of output is equal to the marginal social cost. Because the demand curve measures the marginal benefit to consumers, the efficient output is Q*, at the intersection of the marginal social cost MSC
I 
and demand D curves. The competitive industry output, however, is at Q1, the 
intersection of the demand curve and the supply curve, MCI. Clearly, industry 
output is too high.
In our example, each unit of output results in some effluent being dumped. 
Therefore, whether we are looking at one firm’s pollution or the entire indus-try’s, the economic inefficiency is the excess production that results in too much effluent being dumped in the river. The source of the inefficiency is the incor-rect pricing of the product. The market price P
1 in Figure 18.1 (b) is too low—
it reflects the firms’ marginal private cost of production, but not the marginal social  cost. Only at the higher price P* will steel firms produce the efficient level 
of output.
What is the cost to society of this inefficiency? For each unit produced above 
Q*, the social cost is given by the difference between the marginal social cost 
and the marginal benefit (the demand curve). As a result, the aggregate social cost is shown in Figure 18.1 (b) as the shaded triangle between MSC
I, D, and 
output Q1. When we move from the profit-maximizing to the socially efficient 
output, firms are worse off because their profits are reduced, and purchasers of steel are worse off because the price of steel has increased. However, these losses are less than the gain to those who were harmed by the adverse effect of the dumping of effluent in the river.• marginal external cost

In §9.2, we explain that, absent market failure, a competitive market leads to the economically efficient output level.664  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
Externalities generate both long-run and short-run inefficiencies. In  
Chapter 8, we saw that firms enter a competitive industry whenever the price of the product is above the average cost  of production and exit whenever price is below 
average cost. In long-run equilibrium, price is equal to (long-run) average cost. When there are negative externalities, the average private cost of production is less than the average social cost. As a result, some firms remain in the industry even when it would be efficient for them to leave. Thus, negative externalities encourage too many firms to remain in the industry.
Positive Externalities and Inefficiency
Externalities can also result in too little production, as the example of home repair and landscaping shows. In Figure 18.2, the horizontal axis measures the home owner’s investment (in dollars) in repairs and landscaping. The marginal cost curve for home repair shows the cost of repairs as more work is done on the house; it is horizontal because this cost is unaffected by the amount of repairs. The demand curve D measures the marginal private benefit of the repairs to the 
homeowner. The home owner will choose to invest q
1 in repairs, at the intersec-
tion of her demand and marginal cost curves. But repairs generate external ben-efits to the neighbors, as the marginal external benefit  curve, MEB, shows. This 
curve is downward sloping in this example because the marginal benefit is large for a small amount of repair but falls as the repair work becomes extensive.
The marginal social benefit  curve, MSB, is calculated by adding the  marginal 
private benefit and the marginal external benefit at every level of output. In short, MSB =D+MEB. The efficient level of output q*, at which the marginal 
social benefit of additional repairs is equal to the marginal cost of those repairs, • marginal external benefit

When there are positive externalities, marginal

benefit MEB. A self-interested homeowner invests q
1 in repairs, determined by the intersection of the 
marginal benefit curve D and the marginal cost 
curve MC. The efficient level of repair q* is higher 
and is given by the intersection of the marginal social benefit and marginal cost curves.CHAPTER 18   •  Externalities and Public Goods  665
is found at the intersection of the MSB and MC curves. The inefficiency arises 
because the homeowner doesn’t receive all the benefits of her investment in repairs and landscaping. As a result, the price P
1 is too high to encourage her to 
invest in the socially desirable level of house repair. A lower price, P*, is required 
to encourage the efficient level of supply, q*.
Another example of a positive externality is the money that firms spend 
on research and development (R&D). Often the innovations resulting from research cannot be protected from other firms. Suppose, for example, that a firm designs a new product. If that design can be patented, the firm might earn a large profit by manufacturing and marketing the product. But if the new design can be closely imitated by other firms, those firms can appropriate some of the developing firm’s profit. Because there is then little reward for doing R&D, the market is likely to underfund it.
The externality concept is not new: In discussing demand in Chapter 4, we 
explained that positive and negative network externalities can arise if the quan-tity of a good demanded by a consumer increases or decreases in response to an increase in purchases by other consumers. Network externalities can also lead to market failures. Suppose, for example, that some individuals enjoy socializing at busy ski resorts when many other skiers are present. The resulting conges-tion could make the skiing experience unpleasant for those skiers who preferred short lift lines to pleasant social occasions.
In §4.5, we explain that 
when there is a network externality, each individual’s 
demand depends on  
the purchases of other  individuals.

EMISSIONS
Although sulfur dioxide gas can be produced natu-
rally by volcanoes, almost two-thirds of all sulfur dioxide emissions in the United States come from electric power generation that depends on burn-ing fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum. The effect of sulfur dioxide pollution on the environ-ment has concerned policymakers for years, but these concerns reached new heights in the 1990s (with a series of amendments to the Clean Air Act) because of the potential adverse effects of acid rain. Acid rain—formed when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides react with the atmosphere to form various acidic compounds—threatens property and health throughout the midwestern and northwestern  
United States.
1
Acid rain can adversely affect human health 
either directly, from the atmosphere, or indirectly, through the soil in which our food is grown. Acid rain has been shown to increase risk of heart and lung disorders such as asthma and bronchitis and 
has been linked to premature death in both adults and children. According to one estimate, if sulfur dioxide emissions had been reduced by 50 per-cent of 1980s levels—a time when emissions were at a historic high in the United States—over 17,000 deaths per year would have been prevented.
In addition to human health, acid rain causes dam-
age to water and forests as well as to man-made structures. According to one study, a 50-percent reduction in sulfur dioxide levels in the 1980s would have translated into a $24 million annual value in improvements in recreational fishing, an $800 million annual value to the commercial timber sector, and a $700 million annual value to grain crop producers.
2 
Furthermore, sulfur dioxide emissions have been shown to cause damage to paint, steel, limestone, and marble through increased surface erosion. While the cost of acid rain to man-made materials is  difficult 666  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
to quantify, automobile manufacturers are now offer-
ing acid-resistant paint on new automobiles at an average cost of $5 per car, or $61 million for all new cars and trucks sold in the United States.
What about the costs of achieving reductions in 
sulfur dioxide emissions? To achieve these reduc-tions, firms need to put emissions-control equip-ment into use. The incremental cost of achieving some emissions reduction is likely to be small, but that cost increases as greater and greater invest-ments in capital equipment are needed to achieve further reductions.
An example of the costs and benefits of reduc-
ing sulfur dioxide emissions is given in Figure 18.3, which is based on a study of pollution abatement in Philadelphia.
3 It is easiest to read the graph from 
right to left, since we are looking to see how much of a reduction in sulfur dioxide concentrations from the existing level of .08 parts per million is socially desirable. The marginal abatement cost curve is increasing (from right to left); it jumps whenever new capital-intensive pollution-control equipment is needed to improve fuel efficiency.The marginal external cost curve reflects (again 
reading from right to left) the incremental reduc-tion in the harms caused by acid rain. For moder-ate  concentrations, studies of respiratory diseases, 
corrosion of materials, and lost visibility suggest that marginal social costs are high and relatively constant. However, for very low concentrations, 
the marginal external cost declines, and eventually there are relatively few adverse health, material, or aesthetic effects.
The efficient level of reduced sulfur dioxide 
emissions is given by the number of ppm at which the marginal cost of reduced emissions is equal to the marginal external cost. We can see from Figure 18.3 that this level is approximately .0275 ppm.
To sum up, there are clearly substantial ben-
efits to reducing sulfur dioxide emissions. What if any policies are best utilized to achieve those reductions efficiently? We will return to these questions after we consider a variety of pol-icy options for the treatment of externalities in Section 18.2.

18.2  Ways of Correcting Market Failure
How can the inefficiency resulting from an externality be remedied? If the firm 
that generates the externality has a fixed-proportions production technology, the externality can be reduced only by encouraging the firm to produce less. As we saw in Chapter 8, this goal can be achieved through an output tax. Fortunately, most firms can substitute among inputs in the production process by altering their choices of technology. For example, a manufacturer can add a scrubber to its smokestack to reduce emissions.
Consider a firm that sells its output in a competitive market. The firm emits 
pollutants that damage air quality in a neighborhood. The firm can reduce its emissions, but only at a cost. Figure 18.4 illustrates this trade-off. The horizon-tal axis represents the level of factory emissions and the vertical axis the cost per unit of emissions. To simplify, we assume that the firm’s output decision and its emissions decision are independent and that the firm has already cho-sen its profit-maximizing output level. The firm is therefore ready to choose its preferred level of emissions. The curve labeled MEC represents the marginal 
external cost of emissions.  This social cost curve represents the increased harm 
associated with the emissions. We will use the terms marginal external cost  and 
marginal social cost  interchangeably in the discussion that follows. (Recall that 
we have assumed that the firm’s output is fixed, so that the private costs of production—as opposed to pollution abatement—are unchanged.) The MEC curve slopes upward because the marginal  cost of the externality gets higher as 
the externality becomes more extensive. (Evidence from studies of the effects of air and water pollution suggests that small levels of pollutants generate little harm. However, the harm increases substantially as the level of pollut-ants increases.)
Because our emphasis will be on reducing emissions from existing levels, we 
will find it useful to read the MEC graph from right to left. From this perspec-tive, we see that the MEC associated with a small reduction in emissions from a level of 26 units, which reflects the incremental benefit of reduced emissions, is Recall from §7.3 that a firm 
can substitute among inputs by changing technologies in response to an effluent fee.

THE EFFICIENT LEVEL OF 
 EMISSIONS
The efficient level of factory emissions 
is the level that equates the marginal external cost of emissions MEC to the benefit associated with lower abate-ment costs MCA. The efficient level of 12 units is E*.668  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
greater than $6 per unit. However, as emissions are reduced  further and further, 
the marginal social cost falls (eventually) to below $2 per unit. At some point, the incremental benefit of reducing emissions becomes less than $2.
The curve labeled MCA is the marginal cost of abating emissions.  It measures the 
additional cost to the firm of installing pollution-control equipment. The MCA curve is downward sloping because the marginal cost of reducing emissions is low when the reduction has been slight and high when it has been substantial.  (A slight reduction is inexpensive—the firm can reschedule production to gener-ate the greatest emissions at night, when few people are outside. Large reduc-tions require costly changes in the production process.) As with the MEC curve, reading the MCA curve from right to left will help with our intuition. From this perspective, the marginal cost of abatement increases as we seek to achieve greater and greater reductions in emissions.
With no effort at abatement, the firm’s profit-maximizing level of emissions is 
26, the level at which the marginal cost of abatement is zero. The efficient level of emissions, 12 units, is at point E*, where the marginal external cost of emis-
sions, $3, is equal to the marginal cost of abating emissions. Note that if emis-sions are lower than E*—say, E
0—the marginal cost of abating emissions, $7, is 
greater than the marginal external cost of emissions, $2. Emissions, therefore, are too low relative to the social optimum. However, if the level of emissions is E
1, the marginal external cost of emissions, $4, is greater than the marginal cost 
of abatement, $1. Emissions are then too high.
We can encourage the firm to reduce emissions to E* in three ways: (1) 
emissions standards; (2) emissions fees; and (3) transferable emissions  permits. We will begin by discussing standards and fees and comparing  relative advantages and disadvantages. Then we will examine transferable emissions permits.
An Emissions Standard
An emissions standard  is a legal limit on how much pollutant a firm can emit. 
If the firm exceeds the limit, it can face monetary and even criminal penalties. In Figure 18.5, the efficient emissions standard is 12 units, at point E*. The firm will 
be heavily penalized for emissions greater than this level.
The standard ensures that the firm produces efficiently. The firm meets the 
standard by installing pollution-abatement equipment. The increased abate-ment expenditure will cause the firm’s average cost curve to rise (by the average cost of abatement). Firms will find it profitable to enter the industry only if the price of the product is greater than the average cost of production plus abate-ment—the efficient condition for the industry.
4
An Emissions Fee
An emissions fee  is a charge levied on each unit of a firm’s emissions. As Figure 18.5 
shows, a $3 emissions fee will generate efficient behavior by our factory. Faced with this fee, the firm minimizes costs by reducing emissions from 26 to 12 units. To see why, note that the first unit of emissions can be reduced (from 26 to 25 units of emissions) at very little cost (the marginal cost of additional abatement is close to zero). For very little cost, therefore, the firm can avoid paying the $3 per-unit fee. In fact, for all levels of  emissions above 12 units, the marginal cost • emissions standard  Legal 
limit on the amount of pollutants that a firm can emit.
• emissions fee  Charge 
levied on each unit of a firm’s emissions.
4This analysis assumes that the social costs of emissions do not change over time. If they do, the 
efficient standard will also change.CHAPTER 18   •  Externalities and Public Goods  669
of abatement is less than the emissions fee. Thus it pays to reduce emissions. 
Below 12 units, however, the marginal cost of abatement is greater than the fee. In that case, the firm will prefer to pay the fee rather than further reduce emis-sions. It will therefore pay a total fee given by the gray-shaded rectangle and incur a total abatement cost given by the blue-shaded triangle under the MCA curve to the right of E=12. This cost is less than the fee that the firm would pay 
if it did not reduce emissions at all.
Standards versus Fees
The United States has historically relied on standards to regulate emissions. However, other countries, such as Germany, have used fees successfully. Which method is better? The relative advantages of standards and fees depend on the amount of information available to policymakers and on the actual cost of con-trolling emissions. To understand these differences, let’s suppose that because of administrative costs, the agency that regulates emissions must charge the same fee or set the same standard for all firms.
THE CASE FOR FEES  First, let’s examine the case for fees. Consider two firms 
that are located so that the marginal social cost of emissions is the same no mat-ter which reduces its emissions. Because they have different abatement costs, however, their marginal cost of abatement curves are not the same. Figure 18.6 shows why emissions fees are preferable to standards in this case. MCA
1 and 
MCA2 represent the marginal cost of abatement curves for the two firms. Each 
firm initially generates 14 units of emissions. Suppose we want to reduce total emissions by 14 units. Figure 18.6 shows that the cheapest way to do this is to have Firm 1 reduce emissions by 6 units and Firm 2 by 8. With these reduc-tions, both firms have marginal costs of abatement of $3. But  consider what hap-pens if the regulatory agency asks both firms to reduce emissions by 7 units. In that case Firm 1’s marginal cost of abatement increases from $3 to $3.75, while Firm 2’s marginal cost of abatement decreases from $3 to $2.50. This cannot be MCAMEC

STANDARDS AND FEES
The efficient level of emissions at E* can 
be achieved through either an emissions fee or an emissions standard. Facing a fee of $3 per unit of emissions, a firm reduces emissions to the point at which the fee is equal to the marginal cost of abatement. The same level of emissions reduction can be achieved with a standard that limits emissions to 12 units.670  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
 cost-minimizing because the second firm can reduce emissions more cheaply 
than the first. Only when the marginal cost of abatement is equal for both firms will emissions be reduced by 14 units at minimum cost.
Now we can see why a fee ($3) might be preferable to a standard (7 units). Faced 
with a $3 fee, Firm 1 will reduce emissions by 6 units and Firm 2 by 8 units—the efficient outcome. By contrast, under an emissions standard, Firm 1 incurs addi-tional abatement costs given by the green-shaded area between 7 and 8 units of emissions. But Firm 2 enjoys reduced abatement costs given by the purple-shaded area between 6 and 7 units. Clearly, Firm 1’s added abatement costs are larger than Firm 2’s reduced costs. The emissions fee thus achieves the same level of  emissions at a lower cost than the equal per-firm emissions standard.
In general, fees can be preferable to standards for several reasons. First, when 
standards must be applied equally to all firms, fees achieve the same emissions reduction at a lower cost. Second, fees give a firm a strong incentive to install new equipment that would allow it to reduce emissions even further.  Suppose 
the standard requires that each firm reduce its emission by 6 units, from 14 to 8.  Firm 1 is considering installing new emissions devices that would lower its marginal cost of abatement from MCA
1 to MCA2. If the equipment is relatively 
inexpensive, the firm will install it because it will lower the cost of meeting the standard. However, a $3 emissions fee would provide a greater incentive for the firm to reduce emissions. With the fee, not only will the firm’s cost of abatement be lower on the first 6 units of reduction, but it will also be cheaper to reduce emissions by 2 more units: The emissions fee is greater than the marginal abate-ment cost for emissions levels between 6 and 8.
THE CASE FOR STANDARDS  Now let’s examine the case for standards by 
looking at Figure 18.7. While the marginal external cost curve is very steep, the marginal cost of abatement is relatively flat. The efficient emissions fee is $8. But suppose that because of limited information, a lower fee of $7 is charged (this fee amounts to a 1/8 or 12.5 percent reduction). Because the MCA curve is flat, the firm’s emissions will be increased from 8 to 11 units. This increase lowers the 3.75

THE CASE FOR FEES
With limited information, a policymaker 
may be faced with the choice of either a single emissions fee or a single emis-sions standard for all firms. The fee of $3 achieves a total emissions level of 14 units more cheaply than a 7-unit-per-firm emis-sions standard. With the fee, the firm with a lower abatement cost curve (Firm 2)  reduces emissions more than the firm with 
a higher cost curve (Firm 1).CHAPTER 18   •  Externalities and Public Goods  671
firm’s abatement costs somewhat, but because the MEC curve is steep, there will 
be substantial additional social costs. The increase in social costs, less the savings in abatement costs, is given by the entire shaded (light and dark) triangle ABC.
What happens if a comparable error is made in setting the standard? The 
efficient standard is 8 units of emissions. But suppose the standard is relaxed by 12.5 percent, from 8 to 9 units. As before, this change will lead to an increase in social costs and a decrease in abatement costs. But the net increase in social costs, given by the small triangle ADE , is much smaller than before.
This example illustrates the difference between standards and fees. When the 
marginal external cost curve is relatively steep and the marginal cost of abate-ment curve relatively flat, the cost of not reducing emissions is high. In such cases, a standard is preferable to a fee. With incomplete information, standards offer more certainty about emissions levels but leave the costs of abatement uncertain. Fees, on the other hand, offer certainty about the costs of abatement but leave the reduction of emissions levels uncertain. The preferable policy depends, therefore, on the nature of uncertainty and on the shapes of the cost curves.

Tradeable Emissions Permits
If we knew the costs and benefits of abatement and if all firms’ costs were iden-tical, we could apply a standard. Alternatively, if the costs of abatement varied among firms, an emissions fee would work. However, when firms’ costs vary Dollars

THE CASE FOR STANDARDS
When the government has limited information about the 
costs and benefits of pollution abatement, either a stan-dard or a fee may be preferable. The standard is prefer-able when the marginal external cost curve is steep and the marginal abatement cost curve is relatively flat. Here a 12.5 percent error in setting the standard leads to extra social costs of triangle ADE.  The same percentage error 
in setting a fee would result in excess costs of ABC.
5Our analysis presumes that the emissions fee is levied as a fixed fee per unit of emissions. If the fee 
is set too low because of limited information, the firm will generate a substantial amount of excess emissions. Suppose, however, that a fixed fee were replaced with a fee schedule designed so that the higher the level of emissions the higher the per-unit fee. In this case, if the fee schedule is set too low, the increasing fee will discourage the firm from generating substantial excess emissions. In general, a variable fee is preferable to a standard if the fee schedule can be designed to match the environmental harm caused by the emissions. In this case, firms know that the payment they make will be approximately equal to the harm that they cause and will internalize  that harm in making 
their production decisions. See Louis Kaplow and Steven Shavell, “On the Superiority of Corrective Taxes to Quantity Regulation,” American Law and Economics Review  4 (Spring 2002): 1–17.672  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
and we do not know the costs and benefits, neither a standard nor a fee will 
generate an efficient outcome.
We can reach the goal of reducing emissions efficiently by using tradeable 
emissions permits.  Under this system, each firm must have permits to generate 
emissions. Each permit specifies the number of units of emissions that the firm is allowed to put out. Any firm that generates emissions not allowed by permit is subject to substantial monetary sanctions. Permits are allocated among firms, with the total number of permits chosen to achieve the desired maximum level of emissions. Permits are marketable: They can be bought and sold.
Under the permit system, the firms least able to reduce emissions are those 
that purchase permits. Thus, suppose the two firms in Figure 18.6 (page 670) were given permits to emit up to 7 units. Firm 1, facing a relatively high mar-ginal cost of abatement, would pay up to $3.75 to buy a permit for one unit of emissions, but the value of that permit is only $2.50 to Firm 2. Firm 2 should therefore sell its permit to Firm 1 for a price between $2.50 and $3.75.
If there are enough firms and permits, a competitive market for permits will 
develop. In market equilibrium, the price of a permit equals the marginal cost of abatement for all firms; otherwise, a firm will find it advantageous to buy more permits. The level of emissions chosen by the government will be achieved at min-imum cost. Those firms with relatively low marginal cost of abatement curves will be reducing emissions the most, and those with relatively high marginal cost of abatement curves will be buying more permits and reducing emissions the least.
Marketable emissions permits create a market for externalities. This market 
approach is appealing because it combines some of the advantageous features of a system of standards with the cost advantages of a fee system. The agency that administers the system determines the total number of permits and, therefore, the total amount of emissions, just as a system of standards would do. But the market-ability of the permits allows pollution abatement to be achieved at minimum cost.

EXAMPLE 18.2  REDUCING SULFUR DIOXIDE EMISSIONS IN BEIJING
Taken together, sulfur dioxide 
emissions produced through the burning of coal for use in electric power generation and the wide use of coal-based home furnaces have caused a huge problem in Beijing as well as other cities in China. Not only have emissions created an acid rain problem, but they have combined with emis-sions from the growing number of automobiles to make Beijing one of the most polluted cities not only in China, but in the world. In 1995, 
for example, the level of sulfur dioxide in Beijing was 90 milligrams per cubic meter, which compares unfavorably to Berlin (18 mg/m
3), Copenhagen (7), London (25), 
New York (26), Tokyo (18), and Mexico City (74). Of the major cities in the world, only Moscow had higher sulfur dioxide levels (109 mg/m
3).
Over the long term, the key to solving 
Beijing’s problem is to replace coal with cleaner fuels, to encourage the use of pub-lic transportation, and, when necessary, to 
6With limited information and costly monitoring, a marketable permit system is not always ideal. 
For example, if the total number of permits is chosen incorrectly and the marginal cost of abatement rises sharply for some firms, a permit system could drive those firms out of business by imposing high abatement costs. (This would also be a problem for fees.)CHAPTER 18   •  Externalities and Public Goods  673
introduce fuel-efficient hybrid vehicles. But prior to 
its hosting of the Olympics in 2008, Beijing had a problem. What could it do to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions so as to offer a cleaner environment to the Olympic athletes and to the visiting public?
Beijing’s choice was to shut down a large num-
ber of coal-fired plants. The air quality in Beijing improved 30 percent in 2008 for the Olympics, at a cost of about $10 billion. But a year after the Games, when many of the environmental regulations were no longer in effect, about 60 percent of the improve-ment was lost. Was the shutdown of plants the most efficient policy choice? Our study of pollution-abatement strategies suggests not. For one thing, we have experience with the use of standards for regulating sulfur dioxide emissions in Philadelphia (recall Example 18.1). In 1968, Philadelphia imposed air-quality regulations that limited the maximum allowable sulfur content in fuel oil to 1.0 percent or less. This regulation decreased sulfur dioxide levels in the air substantially—from 0.10 parts per million (ppm) in 1968 to below 0.030 ppm in 1973. Improved air quality led to better human health, less 
damage to materials, and higher property values. Example 18.1 shows that the imposed standards made sense on cost-benefit grounds.
Would the imposition of a system of emissions 
fees—or better yet a regime of tradeable emissions permits—do even better in Beijing? A study of  
the regulation of electric-utility sulfur dioxide trade-able emissions shows that marketable permits in the United States can cut in half the cost of  complying 
with a regulatory-based standard.
7 Can similar gains 
be achieved in Beijing? The answer lies in part on whether the market for tradeable emissions will itself work efficiently. But it also depends on the shape of the marginal abatement cost and marginal exter-nal cost curves. As our prior discussion has shown, the case for emissions fees (and for tradeable per-mits) is strongest (1) when firms vary  substantially 
in their marginal abatement costs; and (2)  
when the marginal external cost of emissions curve is relatively steep and the marginal cost of abate-ment curve relatively flat.

Regulated Utility,” NBER Working Paper No. 5542, April 1996.EXAMPLE 18.3  EMISSIONS TRADING AND CLEAN AIR
Controlling emissions cost companies approxi-
mately $18 billion during the 1980s, and it cost even more during the first half of the 1990s.
8 An effec-
tive emissions trading system could reduce those costs substantially in the decades to come. The Environmental Protection Agency’s “bubble” and “offset” programs were modest attempts to use a trading system to lower cleanup costs.
A bubble allows an individual firm to adjust its 
pollution controls for individual sources of pollut-ants as long as a total pollutant limit  for the firm is 
not exceeded. In theory, a bubble could be used to set pollutant limits for many firms or for an entire geographic region; in practice, however, it has been applied to individual firms. As a result “permits” are, in effect, traded within the firm: If one part of the firm can reduce its emissions, another part will 
be allowed to emit more. Abatement cost savings associated with the EPA’s program of 42 bubbles have been approximately $300 million per year since 1979.
Under the offset program, new sources of emis-
sions may be located in geographic regions in which air-quality standards have not been met, but only if they offset their new emissions by reduc-ing emissions from existing sources by at least as much. Offsets can be obtained by internal trading, but external trading among firms is also allowed. A total of more than 2000 offset transactions have occurred since 1976.
Because of their limited natures, bubble and 
offset programs substantially understate the

Trading,” Regulation  (1987): 48–53; Brian J. McKean, “Evolution of Marketable Permits: The U.S. 
Experience with Sulfur-Dioxide Allowance Trading,” Environmental Protection Agency, December, 1996.674  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
potential gain from a broad-based emissions 
trading  program. In one study, the cost of achiev-
ing an 85-percent reduction in hydrocarbon emis-sions in all U.S. DuPont plants was estimated under three alternative policies: (1) each source at each plant must reduce emissions by 85 per-cent; (2) each plant must reduce its overall emis-sions by 85 percent with only internal trading possible; and (3) total emissions at all plants must be reduced by 85 percent, with both internal and external trading possible.
9 When no trading 
was allowed, the cost of emissions reduction was $105.7 million. Internal trading reduced the cost to $42.6 million. Allowing for both external and internal trading reduced the cost even further, to $14.6 million.
Clearly, the potential cost savings from an effec-
tive tradeable emissions program can be substan-tial. This may explain why Congress focused on transferable permits as a way of dealing with “acid rain” in the 1990 Clean Air Act. Acid rain can be 
extremely harmful to people, animals, vegetation, and buildings. The government initially authorized a permit system to reduce annual sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons and nitrogen oxide emissions by 2.5 million tons by the year 2000. That program remains in place today.
Under the plan, each tradeable permit allows a 
maximum of one ton of sulfur dioxide to be released into the air. Electric utilities and other polluting enti-ties are allocated permits in proportion to their cur-rent level of emissions. Companies can make the capital investments necessary to reduce emissions, perhaps by selling excess permits, or they can buy permits and avoid having to make costly emissions-reducing investments.
In the early 1990s, economists expected 
these permits to trade for around $300. In fact, as Figure 18.8 shows, between 1993 and 2003, prices fluctuated between $100 and $200. Why? It

PRICE OF TRADEABLE EMISSIONS PERMITS
The price of tradeable permits for sulfur dioxide emissions fluctuated between $100 and $200 
from 1993 to 2003, but then increased sharply in 2005 and 2006 in response to an increased  demand for permits. The price fluctuated between $400 and $500 per ton for the next few years, 
before the market crashed in 2008, after the EPA was forced to revise the permit program.CHAPTER 18   •  Externalities and Public Goods  675
Recycling
To the extent that the disposal of waste products involves little or no private 
cost to either consumers or producers, society will dispose of too much waste  material. The overutilization of virgin materials and the underutilization of recycled materials will result in a market failure that may require government intervention. Fortunately, given the appropriate incentive to recycle products, this market failure can be corrected.
11
To see how recycling incentives can work, consider a typical household’s 
decision with respect to the disposal of glass containers. In many communities, households are charged a fixed annual fee for trash disposal. As a result, these households can dispose of glass and other garbage at very low cost—only the time and effort to put the materials in a trash receptacle.
The low cost of disposal creates a divergence between the private and 
the social cost of disposal. The marginal private cost, which is the cost to the household of throwing out the glass, is likely to be constant (indepen-dent of the amount of disposal) for low to moderate levels of disposal. It will then increase for large disposal levels involving additional shipping and dump charges. In contrast, the social cost of disposal includes the harm to the environment from littering, as well as the injuries caused by sharp glass objects. Marginal social cost is likely to increase, in part because the marginal private cost is increasing and in part because the environmental

was less costly than anticipated (it had become cheaper to mine low-sulfur coal), and many elec-tric utilities took advantage of this development to reduce  emissions. From 2005 to 2006, how-
ever, the price of permits rose sharply, hitting a high of nearly $1600 in December 2005. This was the result of an increase in the price of low-sulfur coal and, more importantly, the increased demand for permits that resulted as more electric power plants were required to meet tight emis-sions standards.
10
Starting in 2007, however, the market price of 
emission permits began to decline, in part because the EPA lost a lawsuit brought by a group of utili-ties. The court ruled that the EPA had overstepped its authority by expanding the sulfur permit market beyond its initial scope. The permit market could 
be expanded, the court ruled, but the EPA must rewrite its rules to comply with existing Clean Air Act regulations. Permit prices fell precipitously after the ruling, and the market finally bottomed out in 2010, when the EPA issued new rules that require most emissions reductions to come from changes at individual plants and that limit the use of permit allowances. By 2011, you could buy a permit (perhaps as a gift for a close friend) for as little as $2 per ton.
Will the prices of emission permits remain so 
low that the entire program might be dismantled? The answer depends on the amount of sulfur diox-ide emissions we are willing to allow in the United States. If emission limits are tightened, permit prices could eventually rise.
11Even without market intervention, some recycling will occur if the price of virgin material is suf-
ficiently high. For example, recall from Chapter 2 that when the price of copper is high, there is more recycling of scrap copper.676  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
and aesthetic costs of littering are likely to increase sharply as the level of 
disposal increases.
Both cost curves are shown in Figure 18.9. The horizontal axis measures, from 
left to right, the amount of scrap material m that the household disposes, up to 
a maximum of 12 pounds per week. Consequently, the amount recycled can be read from right to left. As the amount of scrap disposal increases, the marginal private cost, MC, increases, but at a much lower rate than the marginal social cost MSC.
Recycling of containers can be accomplished by a municipality or a private 
firm that arranges for collection, consolidation, and processing of materials. The marginal cost of recycling is likely to increase as the amount of recycling grows, in part because collection, separation, and cleaning costs grow at an increasing rate. The marginal cost of recycling curve, MCR, in Figure 18.9 is best read from right to left. Thus, when there are 12 pounds of disposed mate-rial, there is no recycling; the marginal cost is zero. As the amount of disposal decreases, the amount of recycling increases; the marginal cost of recycling increases.
The efficient amount of recycling occurs at the point at which the marginal 
cost of recycling, MCR, is equal to the marginal social  cost of disposal, MSC. As 
Figure 18.9 shows, the efficient amount of scrap for disposal m* is less than the 
amount that will arise in a private market, m
1.
Why not utilize a disposal fee, a disposal standard, or even transferable dis-
posal permits to resolve this externality? Any of these policies can help in the-ory, but they are not easy to put into practice and are rarely used. For example, a disposal fee is difficult to implement because it would be very costly for a community to sort through trash to separate and then to collect glass materi-als. Pricing and billing for scrap disposal would also be expensive, because the weight and composition of materials would affect the social cost of the scrap and, therefore, the appropriate price to be charged.

REFUNDABLE DEPOSITS  One policy solution that has been used with some suc-
cess to encourage recycling is the refundable deposit.12 Under a refundable deposit 
system, an initial deposit is paid to the store owner when the glass container product is purchased. The deposit is refunded if and when the container is returned to the store or to a recycling center. Refundable deposits create a desirable incentive: The per-unit refund can be chosen so that households (or firms) recycle more material.
From an individual’s point of view, the refundable deposit creates an addi-
tional private cost of disposal: the opportunity cost of failing to obtain a refund. As shown in Figure 18.9, with the higher cost of disposal, the  individual will reduce disposal and increase recycling to the optimal social level m*.
A similar analysis applies at the industry level. Figure 18.10 shows a down-
ward-sloping market demand for glass containers, D. The supply of virgin glass 
containers is given by S
v and the supply of recycled glass by Sr. The market sup-
ply S is the horizontal sum of these two curves. As a result, the market price of 
glass is P and the equilibrium supply of recycled glass is M1.
By raising the relative cost of disposal and encouraging recycling, the refund-
able deposit increases the supply of recycled glass from Sr, to S’r, the aggregate 
supply increases from S to S’, and the price of glass falls to P’. As a result, the 
quantity of recycled glass increases to M*, resulting in a decrease in the amount 
of disposed glass.
The refundable deposit scheme has another advantage: A market for recycled 
products is created. In many communities, public or private firms as well as pri-vate individuals specialize in collecting and returning recyclable materials. As this market becomes larger and more efficient, the demand for recycled rather than virgin materials increases, therefore increasing the benefit to the environment.

Press, 1997), for a general discussion of recycling.$

relative cost of disposal and encouraging recycling, the refundable deposit increases the supply of recycled glass from S
r to S’r and the

EXAMPLE 18.4  REGULATING MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTES
By 1990, the average resident 
of Los Angeles was generating about 6.4 pounds of solid waste per day, and residents of other large American cities were not far behind. By contrast, residents of Tokyo, Paris, Hong Kong, and 
Rome generated 3 pounds, 2.4 pounds, 1.9 pounds, and 1.5 pounds, respectively.
13 Some of these differences 
are due to variations in consumption levels, but most are due to the efforts that many other countries have made to encourage recycling. In the United States, only about 25 percent of aluminum, 23 percent of paper, and 8.5 percent of glass scrap are recycled.
A number of policy proposals have been introduced 
to encourage recycling in the United States. The first is the refundable deposit described above. A second is a curbside charge , in which communities charge indi-
viduals a fee for refuse disposal that is proportional to the weight (or the volume) of the refuse. To encour-age  separation of recyclable materials, all separable 
glass materials are collected for free. Curbside charges encourage recycling, but they fail to discourage con-sumption of products that might require recycling.
A third alternative is to require the mandatory 
separation  of recyclable materials such as glass. 
Random spot checks with substantial penalties for violations are required to make the system effec-tive. Mandatory separation is perhaps the least desirable of the three alternatives, not only because it is difficult to implement, but also because indi-viduals, if the cost of separation is sufficiently high, may be encouraged to shift to alternative contain-ers such as plastic, which are environmentally dam-aging and cannot readily be recycled.The potential effectiveness 
of each of these three policies is illustrated by a study that focused on the mix between glass and plastic. Consumers were assumed to have varying preferences, with half preferring glass and half pre-ferring plastic, for products that are otherwise identical in price, 
quantity, and quality. Without any incentive to recycle, a 50–50 division between glass and plastic would result. From a social perspective, however, greater use of recyclable glass would be preferred.
Mandatory separation fails as a policy in this 
case: The cost of separation is so high that the percentage of glass container materials purchased actually falls to 40 percent. A curbside charge, how-ever, does much better: It leads to a 72.5 percent use of recyclable glass. Finally, a refundable deposit system does best, with 78.9 percent of consumers purchasing recyclable glass containers.
A recent case in Perkasie, Pennsylvania, shows that 
recycling programs can indeed be effective. Prior to implementation of a program combining all three economic incentives just described, the total amount of unseparated solid waste was 2573 tons per year. When the program was implemented, this amount fell to 1038 tons—a 59-percent reduction. As a result, the town saved $90,000 per year in disposal costs.
Recycling efforts have expanded in the past 
decade. By 2009, 50.7 percent of aluminum, 74.2 percent of office paper, and 31.1 percent of glass containers were recycled. In total, Americans  created 4.34 pounds of solid waste per person per

We have studied the negative externalities that result directly from flows  of harm-
ful pollution. For example, we saw how sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants can adversely affect the air that people breathe, so that  government CHAPTER 18   •  Externalities and Public Goods  679
 intervention in the form of emissions fees or standards might be  warranted. 
Recall that we compared the marginal cost of reducing the flow of emissions to 
the marginal benefit in order to determine the socially optimal level of emissions.
Sometimes, however, the damage to society comes not directly from the emis-
sions flow, but rather from the accumulated stock  of the pollutant. A good example 
is global warming. Global warming is thought to result from the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses (GHGs) in the atmosphere. (As the GHG concentration grows, more sunlight is absorbed into the atmosphere rather than being reflected away, causing an increase in average temperatures.) GHG emissions do not cause the kind of immediate harm that sulfur dioxide emissions cause. Rather, it is the stock of accumulated GHGs in the atmosphere  that 
ultimately causes harm. Furthermore, the  dissipation rate  for accumulated GHGs 
is very low: Once the GHG concentration in the atmosphere has increased sub-stantially, it will remain high for many years, even if further GHG emissions were reduced to zero. That is why there is concern about reducing GHG emis-sions now rather than waiting for concentrations to build up (and temperatures to start rising) fifty or more years from now.
Stock externalities  (like flow externalities) can also be positive. An example 
is the stock of “knowledge” that accumulates as a result of investments in R&D. Over time, R&D leads to new ideas, new products, more efficient production techniques, and other innovations that benefit society as a whole, and not just those who undertake the R&D. Because of this positive externality, there is a strong argument for the government to subsidize R&D. Keep in mind, however, that it is the stock  of knowledge and innovations that benefits society, and not 
the flow of R&D that creates the stock.
We examined the distinction between a stock and a flow in Chapter 15. As we 
explained in Section 15.1 (page 560), the capital that a firm owns is measured as a stock , i.e., as a quantity of plant and equipment that the firm owns. The firm can 
increase its stock of capital by purchasing additional plant and equipment, i.e., by generating a flow of investment expenditures. (Recall that inputs of labor and raw 
materials are also measured as flows , as is the firm’s output.) We saw that this dis-
tinction is important, because it helps the firm decide whether to invest in a new factory, equipment, or other capital. By comparing the present discounted value 
(PDV)  of the additional profits likely to result from the investment to the cost of 
the investment, i.e., by calculating the investment’s net present value (NPV) , the 
firm can decide whether or not the investment is economically justified.
The same net present value concept applies when we want to analyze how the 
government should respond to a stock externality—though with an additional complication. For the case of pollution, we must determine how any ongoing level of emissions leads to a buildup of the stock of pollutant, and we must then determine the economic damage likely to result from that higher stock. We will then be able to compare the present value of the ongoing costs of reducing emis-sions each year to the present value of the economic benefits resulting from a reduced future stock of the pollutant.
Stock Buildup and Its Impact
Let’s focus on pollution to see how the stock of a pollutant changes over time. With ongoing emissions, the stock will accumulate, but some fraction of the stock, 
d, will dissipate each year. Thus, assuming the stock starts at zero, in the first 
year, the stock of pollutant ( S) will be just the amount of that year’s  emissions ( E):
S1=E1• stock externality  
Accumulated result of action by a producer or consumer which, though not accounted for in the market price, affects other producers or consumers.
Recall from §15.1 that a firm’s capital is measured as a stock, while the investment that creates the capital is a flow. The firm’s output is also measured as a flow.
Recall from §15.2 that the present discounted value (PDV) of a series of expected future cash flows is the sum of those cash flows discounted by the appropri-ate interest rate. Moreover, we observe in §15.4 that, according to the net pres-ent value (NPV) rule, a firm should invest if the PDV of the expected future cash flow from an investment is greater than the cost.680  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
In the second year, the stock of pollutant will equal the emissions that year plus 
the nondissipated stock from the first year—
S2=E2+(1-d)S1
—and so on. In general, the stock in any year t is given by the emissions gener-
ated that year plus the nondissipated stock from the previous year:
St=Et+(1-d)St-1
If emissions are at a constant annual rate E, then after N years, the stock of 
pollutant will be14:
SN=E[1+(1-d)+(1-d)2+c+(1-d)N-1]
As N becomes infinitely large, the stock will approach the long-run equilibrium 
level E/d.
The impact of pollution results from the accumulating stock. Initially, when 
the stock is small, the economic impact is small; but the impact grows as the stock grows. With global warming, for example, higher temperatures result from higher concentrations of GHGs: thus the concern that if GHG emissions continue at current rates, the atmospheric stock of GHGs will eventually become large enough to cause substantial temperature increases—which, in turn, could have adverse effects on weather patterns, agriculture, and living conditions. Depending on the cost of reducing GHG emissions and the future benefits of averting these temperature increases, it may make sense for governments to adopt policies that would reduce emissions now, rather than waiting for the atmospheric stock of GHGs to become much larger.
NUMERICAL EXAMPLE  We can make this concept more concrete with a simple 
example. Suppose that, absent government intervention, 100 units of a pollutant will be emitted into the atmosphere every year for the next 100 years; the rate at which the stock dissipates, 
d, is 2 percent per year, and the stock of pollutant is 
initially zero. Table 18.1 shows how the stock builds up over time. Note that after 100 years, the stock will reach a level of 4,337 units. (If this level of emissions con-tinued forever, the stock will eventually approach E/d=100/.02 =5,000
 units.)
Suppose that the stock of pollutant creates economic damage (in terms of 
health costs, reduced productivity, etc.) equal to $1 million per unit. Thus, if the total stock of pollutant were, say, 1000 units, the resulting economic damage for that year would be $1 billion. And suppose that the annual cost of reducing emis-sions is $15 million per unit of reduction. Thus, to reduce emissions from 100 units per year to zero would cost 100 *$15
 million =$1.5  billion per year. Would it 
make sense, in this case, to reduce emissions to zero starting immediately?
To answer this question, we must compare the present value of the annual 
cost of $1.5 billion with the present value of the annual benefit resulting from a reduced stock of pollutant. Of course, if emissions were reduced to zero start-ing immediately, the stock of pollutant would likewise be equal to zero over the entire 100 years. Thus, the benefit of the policy would be the savings of social 
14To see this, note that after 1 year, the stock of pollutant is S1=E, in the second 
year the stock is S2=E+(1-d)S1=E+(1-d)E, in the third year, the stock is 
S3=E+(1-d)S2=E+(1-d)E+(1-d)2E, and so on. As N becomes infinitely large, the 
stock approaches E/d.CHAPTER 18   •  Externalities and Public Goods  681
cost associated with a growing stock of pollutant. Table 18.1 shows the annual 
cost of reducing emissions from 100 units to zero, the annual benefit from avert-ing damage, and the annual net benefit (the annual benefit net of the cost of 
eliminating emissions). As you would expect, the annual net benefit is negative in the early years because the stock of pollutant is low; the net benefit becomes positive only later, after the stock of pollutant has grown.
To determine whether a policy of zero emissions makes sense, we must 
 calculate the NPV of the policy, which in this case is the present discounted value of the annual net benefits shown in Table 18.1. Denoting the discount rate by R, the NPV is:
NPV =(-1.5+.1)+ (-1.5+.198)
1+R + (-1.5+.296)
(1+R)2 +c+ (-1.5+4.337)
(1+R)99
Is this NPV positive or negative? The answer depends on the discount rate, R. 
Table 18.2 shows the NPV as a function of the discount rate. (The middle row of Table 18.2, in which the dissipation rate 
d is 2 percent, corresponds to Table 18.1. 
Table 18.2 also shows NPVs for dissipation rates of 1 percent and 4 percent.) For discount rates of 4 percent or less, the NPV is clearly positive, but if the discount rate is large, the NPV will be negative.
Table 18.2 also shows how the NPV of a “zero emissions” policy depends on the 
dissipation rate, 
d. If d is lower, the accumulated stock of pollutant will reach higher 
levels and cause more economic damage, so the future benefits of reducing emis-sions will be greater. Note from Table 18.2 that for any given discount rate, the NPV Recall from §15.1 that 
the NPV of an investment declines as the discount rate becomes larger. Figure 15.3 shows the NPV for an elec-
tric motor factory; note the similarity to our environmen-tal policy problem.TABLE 18.1 BUILDUP IN THE STOCK OF POLLUTANT

Note:  Entries in table are NPVs in $billions. Entries for d=.02 correspond to net benefit numbers in Table 18.1.682  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
of eliminating emissions is much larger if d=.01 and much smaller if d=.04. As 
we will see, one of the reasons why there is so much concern over global warming is the fact that the stock of GHGs dissipates very slowly; 
d is only about .005.
Formulating environmental policy in the presence of stock externalities there-
fore introduces an additional complicating factor: What discount rate should be used? Because the costs and benefits of a policy apply to society as a whole, the discount rate should likewise reflect the opportunity cost to society of receiving an economic benefit in the future rather than today. This opportunity cost, which should be used to calculate NPVs for government projects, is called the social rate 
of discount.  But as we will see in Example 18.5, there is little agreement among 
economists as to the appropriate number to use for the social rate of discount.
In principle, the social rate of discount depends on three factors: (1) the 
expected rate of real economic growth; (2) the extent of risk aversion for society as a whole; and (3) the “rate of pure time preference” for society as a whole. With rapid economic growth, future generations will have higher incomes than cur-rent generations, and if their marginal utility of income is decreasing (i.e., they are risk-averse), their utility from an extra dollar of income will be lower than the utility to someone living today; that’s why future benefits provide less utility and should thus be discounted. In addition, even if we expected no economic growth, people may simply prefer to receive a benefit today than in the future (the rate of pure time preference). Depending on one’s beliefs about future real economic growth, the extent of risk aversion for society as a whole, and the rate of pure time preference, one could conclude that the social rate of discount should be as high as 6 percent—or as low as 1 percent. And herein lies the difficulty. With a discount rate of 6 percent, it is hard to justify almost any government policy that imposes costs today but yields benefits only 50 or 100 years in the future (e.g., a policy to deal with global warming). Not so, however, if the discount rate is only 1 or 2 percent.
15 Thus for problems involving long time horizons, the policy debate often 
boils down to a debate over the correct discount rate.• social rate of discount  
Opportunity cost to society as a whole of receiving an economic benefit in the future rather than the present.
15For example, with a discount rate of 6 percent, $100 received 100 years from now is worth only $0.29 
today. With a discount rate of 1 percent, that same $100 is worth $36.97 today, i.e., 127 times as much.EXAMPLE 18.5  GLOBAL WARMING
Emissions of carbon dioxide and 
other greenhouse gases have increased dramatically over the past century as economic growth has been accompanied by the greater use of fossil fuels, which has in turn led to an increase in atmospheric concentrations of GHGs. Even if worldwide GHG emissions were to be stabilized at current levels, atmospheric GHG concentra-tions would continue to grow throughout the next  century. By trapping sunlight, these higher GHG 
concentrations are likely to cause a significant increase in global mean tem-
peratures in 50 years or so and could have severe environmental  consequences—flooding of low- 
lying areas as the polar ice caps melt and sea levels rise, more extreme weather pat-terns, disruption of ecosys-tems, and reduced agricultural  output. GHG emissions could be 
reduced from their current  levels—governments, 
for example, could impose stiff taxes on the use of gasoline and other fossil fuels—but this solution would be costly. The problem is that the costs of 
CHAPTER 18   •  Externalities and Public Goods  683
reducing GHG emissions would occur today, but 
the benefits from reduced emissions would be real-ized only in some 50 or more years. Should the world’s industrialized countries agree to adopt poli-cies to dramatically reduce GHG emissions, or is the present discounted value of the likely benefits of such policies simply too small?
Many climate scientists and economists have 
studied the probable build-up of GHG concentra-
tions and resulting increases in global temperatures if no steps are taken to reduce emissions. Although there is considerable uncertainty over the economic impact of higher temperatures, the consensus view is that the impact could be significant, so that there would be a future benefit from reducing emissions today.
16 The cost of reducing emissions (or prevent-
ing them from growing above current levels) can be assessed as well, although here too there is uncer-tainty over the specific numbers.
Table 18.3 shows GHG emissions and average 
global temperature change at ten-year  intervals for two scenarios. The first is a “business as usual” 
scenario in which GHG emissions are projected to more than double over the next century so that the average GHG concentration rises con-
siderably, and by 2110 the average temperature is 4 degrees Celsius above its current level. The resulting damage each year from this temperature increase is estimated to be 1.3 percent of world GDP per degree Celsius of temperature increase. World GDP is in turn assumed to grow at 2.5 per-cent per year in real terms from its 2010 value of $65 trillion, reaching $768 trillion in 2110. Thus the annual damage from global warming reaches about 
(.01)(4)(768) =+40 trillion  in 2110.
The second scenario shown in Table 18.3 is one 
in which the GHG concentration is stabilized at 550 ppm so that the temperature increase is limited to only 2 degrees Celsius, which is reached in 2060. To achieve this, GHG emissions must be reduced by 1 percent per year starting in 2010. The annual cost of this emissions reduction policy is estimated to be

18.4  Externalities and Property Rights
We have seen how government regulation can deal with the inefficiencies that 
arise from externalities. Emissions fees and transferable emissions permits work because they change a firm’s incentives, forcing it to take into account the exter-nal costs that it imposes. But government regulation is not the only way to deal with externalities. In this section we show that in some circumstances, inefficien-cies can be eliminated through private bargaining among the affected parties or by a legal system in which parties can sue to recover the damages they suffer.
Property Rights
Property rights  are the legal rules that describe what people or firms may do 
with their property. If you have property rights to land, for example, you may build on it or sell it and are protected from interference by others.
To see why property rights are important, let’s return to our example of the 
firm that dumps effluent into the river. We assumed both that it had a property right to use the river to dispose of its waste and that the fishermen did not have a property right to “effluent-free” water. As a result, the firm had no incentive to include the cost of effluent in its production calculations. In other words, the firm externalized  the costs generated by the effluent. But suppose that the fishermen 
had a property right to clean water. In that case, they could demand that the firm pay them for the right to dump effluent. The firm would either cease production • property rights  Legal rules 
stating what people or firms may do with their property.1 percent of world GDP .17 (Because world GDP is 
assumed to increase each year, so too does the cost of this policy.) Also shown in the table is the annual net benefit from the policy, which equals the dam-age under the “business as usual” scenario minus the (smaller) damage when emissions are reduced minus the cost of reducing emissions.
Does this emissions-reduction policy make 
sense? To answer that question, we must calculate the present value of the flow of net benefits, which depends critically on the discount rate. A review conducted in the United Kingdom recommends a social rate of discount of 1.3 percent. With that  discount rate, the NPV of the policy is $21.3 trillion, which shows that the emissions-reduction policy 
is clearly economical. The NPV is smaller but still positive ($1.63 trillion) if we use a discount rate of 2  percent. But with a discount rate of 3 percent, the 
NPV is 
-+9.7  trillion ; with a discount rate of 5 per-
cent, the NPV is -+12.7  trillion.
We have examined a particular policy—and a rather 
stringent one at that—to reduce GHG emissions. Whether that policy or any other policy to restrict GHG emissions makes economic sense clearly depends on the rate used to discount future costs and benefits. Be warned, however, that economists disagree about what rate to use, and as a result, they disagree about what should be done about global warming.
18
18This disagreement over the discount rate and its crucial role in assessing policies to reduce GHG 
emissions is spelled out quite nicely in Martin Weitzman, “The Stern Review of the Economics of Climate Change,” Journal of Economic Literature  (September 2007). Also, there are many uncertainties 
about the size of possible future temperature increases and their social and economic impact. Those uncertainties can have implications for policy but have been ignored in this example. See, for exam-ple, R. S. Pindyck, “Uncertainty in Environmental Economics,” Journal of Environmental Economics 
and Policy  (Winter 2007), R.S. Pindyck, “Uncertain Outcomes and Climate Change Policy,” Journal of 
Environmental Economics and Management,  2012.17This policy is the one recommended by the Stern Review, commissioned by the U.K. Government, 
and available online at http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/stern_review_report.htm . The cost esti-
mate of 1 percent of GDP is from the Stern Review, and is probably too optimistic. The estimate of the damage from higher temperatures (1.3 percent of GDP for each 1 degree Celsius increase) is an amalgam of estimates from the Stern Review and the IPCC Report.CHAPTER 18   •  Externalities and Public Goods  685
or pay the costs associated with the effluent. These costs would be internalized  
and an efficient allocation of resources achieved.
Bargaining and Economic Efficiency
Economic efficiency can be achieved without government intervention when the externality affects relatively few parties and when property rights are well specified. To see how, let’s consider a numerical version of our effluent example. Suppose the steel factory’s effluent reduces the fishermen’s profit. As Table 18.4 shows, the factory can install a filter system to reduce its effluent, or the fisher-men can pay for the installation of a water treatment plant.
19
The efficient solution maximizes the joint profit of the factory and the fisher-
men. Maximization occurs when the factory installs a filter and the fishermen do not build a treatment plant. Let’s see how alternative property rights lead these two parties to negotiate different solutions.
Suppose the factory has the property right to dump effluent into the river. 
Initially, the fishermen’s profit is $100 and the factory’s $500. By installing a treat-ment plant, the fishermen can increase their profit to $200, whereby the joint profit, without cooperation, is $ 700 ($500 +$200). Moreover, the fishermen are willing 
to pay the factory up to $300 to install a filter—the difference between the $500 profit with a filter and the $200 profit without cooperation. Because the factory loses only $200 in profit by installing a filter, it will be willing to do so because it is more than compensated for its loss. In this case, the gain to both parties by coop-erating is equal to $100: the $300 gain to the fishermen less the $200 cost of a filter.
Suppose the factory and the fishermen agree to split this gain equally by  having 
the fishermen pay the factory $250 to install the filter. As Table 18.5 shows, this bargaining solution achieves the efficient outcome. Under the column “Right to Dump,” we see that without cooperation, the fishermen earn a profit of $200 and the factory $500. With cooperation, the profit of both increases by $50.
Now suppose the fishermen are given the property right to clean water, which 
requires the factory to install the filter. The factory earns a profit of $300 and the fishermen $500. Because neither party can be made better off by  bargaining, having the factory install the filter is efficient.
This analysis applies to all situations in which property rights are well specified. 
When parties can bargain without cost and to their mutual advantage, the resulting outcome will be efficient, regardless of how the property rights are specified.  The italicized proposi-
tion is called the Coase theorem,  after Ronald Coase who did much to develop it.

Costly Bargaining—The Role of Strategic Behavior
Bargaining can be time-consuming and costly, especially when property rights are 
not clearly specified. In that case, neither party is sure how hard to bargain before the other party will agree to a settlement. In our example, both parties knew that the bargaining process had to settle on a payment between $200 and $300. If the parties are unsure of the property rights, however, the fishermen might be will-ing to pay only $100, and the bargaining process would break down.
Bargaining can break down even when communication and monitoring are 
costless if both parties believe they can obtain larger gains. For example, one party might demand a large share and refuse to bargain, assuming incorrectly that the other party will eventually concede. Another problem arises when many parties are involved. Suppose, for example, that the emissions from a factory are adversely affecting hundreds or thousands of households who live downstream. In that case, the costs of bargaining will make it very difficult for the parties to reach a settlement.
A Legal Solution—Suing for Damages
In many situations involving externalities, a party who is harmed (the victim) by another has the legal right to sue. If successful, the victim can recover  monetary 
damages equal to the harm that it has suffered. A suit for damages is differ-ent from an emissions or effluent fee because the victim, not the government,  
is paid.
To see how the potential for a lawsuit can lead to an efficient outcome, let’s 
reexamine our fishermen–factory example. Suppose first that the fishermen are given the right to clean water. The factory, in other words, is responsible for harm to the fishermen if it does not install a filter. The harm to the fishermen in 
this case is $400: the difference between the profit that the fishermen make when there is no effluent ($500) and their profit when there is effluent ($100). The fac-tory has the following options:
1. Do not install filter, pay damages: Profit =$100
 ($500 -$400)
2. Install filter, avoid damages: Profit =$300  ($500 -$200)
The factory will find it advantageous to install a filter, which is substantially 
cheaper than paying damages, and the efficient outcome will be achieved.
An efficient outcome (with a different division of profits) will also be achieved 
if the factory is given the property right to emit effluent. Under the law, the fish-ermen would have the legal right to require the factory to install the filter, but TABLE 18.5  BARGAINING WITH ALTERNATIVE PROPERTY

they would have to pay the factory for its $200 lost profit (not for the cost of the 
filter). This leaves the fishermen with three options:
1. Put in a treatment plant: Profit =$200
2.  Have factory put in a filter 
but pay damages:Profit =$300  ($500 -$200)
3.  Do not put in treatment 
plant or require a filter:Profit =$100
The fishermen earn the highest profit if they take the second option. They will 
thus require the factory to put in a filter but compensate it $200 for its lost profit. Just as in the situation in which the fishermen had the right to clean water, this outcome is efficient because the filter has been installed. Note, however, that the $300 profit is substantially less than the $500 profit that the fishermen get when they have a right to clean water.
This example shows that a suit for damages eliminates the need for bargain-
ing because it specifies the consequences of the parties’ choices. Giving the party that is harmed the right to recover damages from the injuring party ensures an efficient outcome. (When information is imperfect, however, suing for damages may lead to inefficient outcomes.)
18.5  Common Property Resources
Occasionally externalities arise when resources can be used without payment. Common property resources  are those to which anyone has free access. As a 
result, they are likely to be overutilized. Air and water are the two most com-mon examples. Others include fish, animal populations, mineral exploration, and extraction. Let’s look at some of the inefficiencies that can occur when resources are common property rather than privately owned.• common property

anyone has free access.EXAMPLE 18.6  THE COASE THEOREM AT WORK
As a September 1987 cooperative agreement 
between New York City and New Jersey illustrates, the Coase theorem applies to governments as well as to people and organizations.
For many years, garbage spilling from waterfront 
trash facilities along New York harbor had adversely affected the quality of water along the New Jersey shore and occasionally littered the beaches. One of the worst instances occurred in August 1987, when more than 200 tons of garbage formed a 50-mile-long slick off the New Jersey shore.
New Jersey had the right to clean beaches and 
could have sued New York City to recover damages associated with garbage spills. New Jersey could have also asked the court to grant an injunction requiring New York City to stop using its trash facili-ties until the problem was removed.But New Jersey wanted cleaner beaches, not 
simply the recovery of damages. And New York wanted to be able to operate its trash facility. Consequently, there was room for mutually ben-eficial exchange. After two weeks of negotia-tions, New York and New Jersey reached a settle-ment. New Jersey agreed not to bring a lawsuit against the city. New York City agreed to use special boats and other flotation devices to con-tain spills that might originate from Staten Island and Brooklyn. It also agreed to form a monitoring team to survey all trash facilities and to shut down those failing to comply. At the same time, New Jersey officials were allowed unlimited access to New York City trash facilities to monitor the pro-gram’s effectiveness.688  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
Consider a large lake with trout to which an unlimited number of fishermen 
have access. Each fisherman fishes up to the point at which the marginal rev-enue from fishing (or the marginal value, if fishing is for sport instead of profit) is equal to the cost. But the lake is a common property resource, and no fisher-man has the incentive to take into account how his fishing affects the oppor-tunities of others. As a result, the fisherman’s private cost understates the true cost to society because more fishing reduces the stock of fish, making less avail-able for others. This leads to an inefficiency—too many fish are caught.
Figure 18.11 illustrates this situation. Suppose that because the catch is suf-
ficiently small relative to demand, fishermen take the price of fish as given. Suppose also that someone can control the number of fishermen with access to the lake. The efficient level of fish per month F* is determined at the point at 
which the marginal benefit from fish caught is equal to the marginal social cost. The marginal benefit is the price taken from the demand curve. The marginal social cost shown in the diagram includes not only the private operating costs but also the social cost of depleting the stock of fish.
Now compare the efficient outcome with what happens when the lake is 
common property. In this case, the marginal external costs are not taken into account, and each fisherman fishes until there is no longer any profit to be made. When only F* fish are caught, the revenue from fishing is greater than the cost, 
and there is a profit to be earned by fishing more. Entry into the fishing business occurs until the point at which the price is equal to the marginal cost, point F

Figure 18.11. At Fc, however, too many fish will be caught.
There is a relatively simple solution to the common property resource prob-
lem—let a single owner manage the resource. The owner will set a fee for use of the resource that is equal to the marginal cost of depleting the stock of fish. Facing the payment of this fee, fishermen in the aggregate will no longer find it profitable to catch more than F* fish. Unfortunately, most common property 
resources are vast and single ownership is not always practical. Over the past several decades, government oversight has provided a partial resolution to the problem. In many fishing areas in the United States, the government deter-

EXAMPLE 18.7  CRAWFISH FISHING IN LOUISIANA
In recent years, crawfish have 
become a popular restaurant item. In 1950, for example, the annual crawfish harvest in the Atchafalaya River basin in Louisiana was just over 1 million pounds. By 1995, it had grown to over 30 million pounds. Because most crawfish grow in ponds to which fishermen have unlimited access, a common property resource problem has arisen: Too many crawfish have been trapped, causing the craw-fish population to fall far below the efficient level.
22
How serious is the problem? 
Specifically, what is the social cost of unlimited access to fishermen? The answer can be found 
by estimating the private cost of trapping crawfish, the marginal social cost, and the demand for crawfish. Figure 18.12 shows portions of the relevant curves. Private cost is upward-sloping: As the catch increases, so does the additional effort that must be made to obtain it. The demand curve is downward sloping but elastic because other shellfish are close substitutes.
We can find the efficient crawfish 
catch both graphically and algebraically. Let F represent the catch of crawfish in 
millions of pounds per year (shown on the horizontal axis), and let C represent 
cost in dollars per pound (shown on the vertical

Because crawfish are bred in ponds to which fishermen

18.6  Public Goods
We have seen that externalities, including common-property resources, create mar-
ket inefficiencies that sometimes warrant government regulation. When, if ever, should governments replace private firms as a producer of goods and services? In this section we describe a set of conditions under which the private market either may not provide a good at all or may not price it properly once it is available.
NONRIVAL GOODS  As we saw in Chapter 16, public goods  have two charac-
teristics: They are nonrival  and nonexclusive.  A good is nonrival  if for any given 
level of production, the marginal cost of providing it to an additional consumer is zero. For most goods that are provided privately, the marginal cost of pro-ducing more of the good is positive. But for some goods, additional consumers do not add to cost. Consider the use of a highway during a period of low traf-fic volume. Because the highway already exists and there is no congestion, the additional cost of driving on it is zero. Or consider the use of a lighthouse by a ship. Once the lighthouse is built and functioning, its use by an additional ship adds nothing to its running costs. Finally, consider public television. Clearly, the cost of one more viewer is zero.
Most goods are rival in consumption. For example, when you buy furniture, you 
have ruled out the possibility that someone else can buy it. Goods that are rival must be allocated among individuals. Goods that are nonrival can be made available to everyone without affecting any individual’s opportunity for consuming them.
NONEXCLUSIVE GOODS  A good is nonexclusive  if people cannot be excluded 
from consuming it. As a consequence, it is difficult or impossible to charge peo-ple for using nonexclusive goods; the goods can be enjoyed without direct pay-ment. One example of a nonexclusive good is national defense. Once a nation has provided for its national defense, all citizens enjoy its benefits. A lighthouse and public television are also examples of nonexclusive goods.
Nonexclusive goods need not be national in character. If a state or city eradi-
cates an agricultural pest, all farmers and consumers benefit. It would be virtu-ally impossible to exclude a particular farmer from the benefits of the program. Automobiles are exclusive (as well as rival). If a dealer sells a new car to one consumer, then the dealer has excluded other individuals from buying it.• public good  Nonexclusive 
and nonrival good: The marginal cost of provision to an additional consumer is zero and people cannot be excluded from consuming it.

which the marginal cost of its provision to an additional consumer is zero.

that people cannot be excluded from consuming, so that it is difficult or impossible to charge for its use.axis). In the region where the various curves inter-
sect, the three curves in the graph are as follows:
Demand    C =0.401 -0.0064 F
Marginal  
social cost   C =-5.645 +0.6509 F
Private cost: C=-0.357 +0.0573 F
The efficient crawfish catch of 9.2 million pounds, 
which equates demand to marginal social cost, is shown as the intersection of the two curves. The actual catch, 11.9 million pounds, is determined by equating demand to private cost and is shown as the 
intersection of those two curves. The yellow-shaded triangle in the figure measures the social cost of free access. This figure represents the excess of social cost above the private benefit of fishing summed from the efficient level (where demand is equal to marginal social cost) to the actual level (where demand is equal to private cost). In this case, the social cost is approxi-mated by the area of a triangle with a base of 2.7 million pounds (11.9 -9.2) and a height of $1.775 
(+2.10 -+0.325), or $2,396,000. Note that by regu-
lating the ponds— limiting either access or the size of 
the catch—this social cost could be avoided.CHAPTER 18   •  Externalities and Public Goods  691
Some goods are exclusive but nonrival. For example, in periods of low traffic, 
travel on a bridge is nonrival because an additional car on the bridge does not lower the speed of other cars. But bridge travel is exclusive because bridge author-ities can keep people from using it. A television signal is another example. Once a signal is broadcast, the marginal cost of making the broadcast available to another user is zero; thus the good is nonrival. But broadcast signals can be made exclusive by scrambling the signals and charging for the codes that unscramble them.
Some goods are nonexclusive but rival. An ocean or large lake is nonexclu-
sive, but fishing is rival because it imposes costs on others: the more fish caught, the fewer fish available to others. Air is nonexclusive and often nonrival; but it can be rival if the emissions of one firm adversely affect the quality of the air and the ability of others to enjoy it.
Public goods, which are both nonrival and nonexclusive, provide benefits to 
people at zero marginal cost, and no one can be excluded from enjoying them. The classic example of a public good is national defense. Defense is nonexclu-sive, as we have seen, but it is also nonrival because the marginal cost of provid-ing defense to an additional person is zero. The lighthouse is also a public good because it is nonrival and nonexclusive; in other words, it would be difficult to charge ships for the benefits they receive from it.
23
The list of public goods is much smaller than the list of goods that govern-
ments provide. Many publicly provided goods are either rival in consumption, exclusive, or both. For example, high school education is rival in consumption. Because other children get less attention as class sizes increase, there is a posi-tive marginal cost of providing education to one more child. Likewise, charging tuition can exclude some children from enjoying education. Public education is provided by local government because it entails positive externalities, not because it is a public good.
Finally, consider the management of a national park. Part of the public can be 
excluded from using the park by raising entrance and camping fees. Use of the park is also rival: because of crowded conditions, the entrance of an additional car into a park can reduce the benefits that others receive from it.
Efficiency and Public Goods
The efficient level of provision of a private good is determined by comparing the marginal benefit of an additional unit to the marginal cost of producing it. Efficiency is achieved when the marginal benefit and the marginal cost are equal. The same principle applies to public goods, but the analysis is different. With private goods, the marginal benefit is measured by the benefit that the  consumer receives. With a public good, we must ask how much each person values an additional unit of output. The marginal benefit is obtained by adding these values for all people who enjoy the good. To determine the efficient level 
of provision of a public good, we must then equate the sum of these marginal benefits to the marginal cost of  production.
Figure 18.13 illustrates the efficient level of producing a public good. D
1 rep-
resents the demand for the public good by one consumer and D2 the demand 
by a second consumer. Each demand curve tells us the marginal benefit that the consumer gets from consuming every level of output. For example, when there are 2 units of the public good, the first consumer is willing to pay $1.50 for the 
23Lighthouses need not be provided by the government. See Ronald Coase, “The Lighthouse in 
Economics,” Journal of Law and Economics  17 (1974): 357–76, for a description of how lighthouses 
were privately funded in nineteenth-century England.692  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
good, and $1.50 is the marginal benefit. Similarly, the second consumer has a 
marginal benefit of $4.00.
To calculate the sum of the marginal benefits to both people, we must add 
each of the demand curves vertically.  For example, when the output is 2 units, 
we add the marginal benefit of $1.50 to the marginal benefit of $4.00 to obtain a marginal social benefit of $5.50. When this sum is calculated for every level of public output, we obtain the aggregate demand curve for the public good D.
The efficient amount of output is the one at which the marginal benefit 
to  society is equal to the marginal cost. This occurs at the intersection of the demand and the marginal cost curves. In our example, because the marginal cost of production is $5.50, 2 is the efficient output level.
To see why 2 is efficient, note what happens if only 1 unit of output is 
 provided: Although the marginal cost remains at $5.50, the marginal benefit is approximately $7.00. Because the marginal benefit is greater than the marginal cost, too little of the good has been provided. Similarly, suppose 3 units of the public good have been produced. Now the marginal benefit of approximately $4.00 is less than the marginal cost of $5.50; too much of the good has been  provided. Only when the marginal social benefit is equal to the marginal cost is the public good provided efficiently.

Public Goods and Market Failure
Suppose you want to offer a mosquito abatement program for your community. You know that the program is worth more to the community than the $50,000 it will cost. Can you make a profit by providing the program privately? You would break even if you assessed a $5.00 fee to each of the 10,000 households In §4.3, we show that a 
market demand curve can be obtained by summing individual demand curves horizontally.Marginal Cost

EFFICIENT PUBLIC GOOD PROVISION
When a good is nonrival, the social marginal 
benefit of consumption, given by the demand curve D, is determined by vertically summing 
the individual demand curves for the good, D
1 and D2. At the  efficient level of output, the 
 demand and the marginal cost curves intersect.
24We have shown that nonexclusive, nonrival goods are inefficiently provided. A similar argument 
would apply to nonrival but exclusive goods.CHAPTER 18   •  Externalities and Public Goods  693

Air,” Journal of Environmental Economics and Management  5 (1978): 81–102.in your community. But you cannot force them to pay the fee, let alone devise a 
system in which those households that value mosquito abatement most highly pay the highest fees.
Unfortunately, mosquito abatement is nonexclusive: There is no way to pro-
vide the service without benefiting everyone. As a result, households have no incentive to pay what the program really is worth to them. People can act as free riders,  who understate the value of the program so that they can enjoy the 
benefit of the good without paying for it.
With public goods, the presence of free riders makes it difficult or impossible 
for markets to provide goods efficiently. Perhaps if few people were involved and the program were relatively inexpensive, all households might agree volun-tarily to share costs. However, when many households are involved, voluntary private arrangements are usually ineffective. The public good must therefore be subsidized or provided by governments if it is to be produced efficiently.• free rider  Consumer or 
producer who does not pay for a nonexclusive good in the expectation that others will.
EXAMPLE 18.8  THE DEMAND FOR CLEAN AIR
In Example 4.6 (page 134), we used the 
demand curve for clean air to calculate the benefits of a cleaner environment. Now let’s examine the public-good characteristics of clean air. Many fac-tors, including the weather, driving pat-terns, and industrial emissions, deter-mine a region’s air quality. Any effort to clean up the air will generally improve air quality throughout the region. As a result, clean air is nonexclusive: It is difficult to stop any one person from enjoying it. Clean air is also nonrival: My enjoyment does not inhibit yours.
Because clean air is a public good, there is no 
market and no observable price at which people are willing to trade clean air for other commodi-ties. Fortunately, we can infer people’s willingness to pay for clean air from the housing market—house-holds will pay more for a home located in an area with good air quality than for an otherwise identical home in an area with poor air quality.
Let’s look at the estimates of the demand for clean 
air obtained from a statistical analysis of housing data for the Boston metropolitan area.
25 The analysis cor-
relates housing prices with the quality of air and other characteristics of the houses and their neighborhoods. Figure 18.14 shows three demand curves in which the value put on clean air depends on the 
level of nitrogen oxides and on income. The horizontal axis measures the level of air pollution in terms of parts per hun-dred million (pphm) of nitrogen oxide in the air. The vertical axis measures each household’s willingness to pay for a one-part-per-hundred-million reduction in the nitrogen oxide level.
The demand curves are upward-
sloping because we are measuring  pollution rather than clean air on the 
horizontal axis. As we would expect, the 
cleaner the air, the lower the willingness to pay for more of the good. These differences in the willing-ness to pay for clean air vary substantially. In Boston, for example, nitrogen oxide levels ranged from 3 to  
9 pphm. A middle-income household would be  
willing to pay $800 for a 1 pphm reduction in nitro-gen oxide levels when the level is 3 pphm, but the figure would jump to $2200 for a 1 pphm reduction when the level is 9 pphm.
Note that higher-income households are willing to 
pay more than lower-income households to obtain a small improvement in air quality. At low nitrogen oxide levels (3 pphm), the differential between low- and middle-income households is only $200, but it increases to about $700 at high levels (9 pphm).
694  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
With quantitative information about the demand 
for clean air and separate estimates of the costs of improving air quality, we can determine whether the benefits of environmental regulations outweigh the costs. A study by the National Academy of Sciences of regulations on automobile emissions did just this. The study found that controls would lower the level of pol-lutants, such as nitrogen oxides, by approximately 10 percent. The benefit of this 10-percent improvement 
to all residents of the United States was  calculated to 
be approximately $2 billion. The study also estimated that it would cost somewhat less than $2 billion to install pollution control equipment in automobiles to meet emissions standards. The study concluded, therefore, that the benefits of the regulations did out-weigh the costs.FIGURE 18.14
THE DEMAND FOR CLEAN AIR
The three curves describe the willing-
ness to pay for clean air (a reduction in the level of nitrogen oxides) for each of three different households (low income, middle income, and high income). In general, higher-income households have greater demands for clean air than low-er-income households. Moreover, each household is less willing to pay for clean air as the level of air quality increases.Willingness

18.7  Private Preferences for Public Goods
Government production of a public good is advantageous because the govern-
ment can assess taxes or fees to pay for it. But how can government determine how much  of a public good to provide when the free rider problem gives peo-
ple an incentive to misrepresent their preferences? In this section we discuss one mechanism for determining private preferences for government-produced goods.
Voting is commonly used to decide allocation questions. For example, people 
vote directly on some local budget issues and elect legislators who vote on oth-ers. Many state and local referenda are based on majority-rule voting : Each person 
has one vote, and the candidate or the issue that receives more than 50 percent of the votes wins. Let’s see how majority-rule voting determines the provision of public education. Figure 18.15 describes the preferences for spending on  education (on a per-pupil basis) of three citizens who are representative of three interest groups in the school district.CHAPTER 18   •  Externalities and Public Goods  695
Curve W1 gives the first citizen’s willingness to pay for education, minus 
any required tax payments. The willingness to pay for each spending level is the maximum amount of money the citizen will pay to enjoy that spending level rather than no spending at all.
26 In general, the benefit from increased 
spending on education increases as spending increases. But the tax payments required to pay for that education increase as well. The willingness-to-pay curve, which represents the net benefit of educational spending, initially slopes upward because the citizen places great value on low spending levels. When spending increases beyond $600 per pupil, however, the value that the household puts on education increases at a diminishing rate. The net benefit, therefore, actually declines. Eventually, the spending level becomes so great (at $2400 per pupil) that the citizen is indifferent between this level of spend-ing and no spending at all.
Curve W
2, which represents the second citizen’s willingness to pay (net of taxes) 
is similarly shaped but reaches its maximum at a spending level of $1200 per pupil. Finally, W
3, the willingness to pay of the third citizen, peaks at $1800 per pupil.
The dark line labeled AW represents the aggregate willingness to pay for 
education—the vertical summation of the W1, W2, and W3 curves. The AW 
curve measures the maximum amount that all three citizens are willing to pay to enjoy each spending level. As Figure 18.15 shows, the aggregate willingness to pay is maximized when $1200 per pupil is spent. Because the AW curve measures the benefit of spending net of the tax payments required to pay for that spending, the maximum point, $1200 per pupil, also represents the effi-cient level of spending.
Will majority-rule voting achieve the efficient outcome in this case? Suppose the 
public must vote whether to spend $1200 or $600 per pupil. The first citizen will vote for $600, but the other two citizens will vote for $1200, which will then have been chosen by majority rule. In fact, $1200 per pupil will beat any other alternative in a majority-rule vote. Thus, $1200 represents the most preferred alternative of the median voter —the citizen with the median or middle preference. (The first citizen 
prefers $600 and the third $1800.) Under majority rule voting, the preferred spending 
level of the median voter will always win an election against any other alternative.W1W2W3AW

DETERMINING THE LEVEL OF 
 EDUCATIONAL SPENDING
The efficient level of educational spending is de-
termined by summing the willingness to pay for education (net of tax payments) of each of three citizens. Curves W
1, W2, and W3 represent their 
willingness to pay, and curve AW represents the aggregate willingness to pay. The efficient level of spending is $1200 per pupil. The level of spend-ing actually provided is the level demanded by the median voter. In this particular case, the median voter’s preference (given by the peak of the W
2 
curve) is also the efficient level.
26In other words, the willingness to pay measures the consumer surplus that the citizen enjoys when 
a particular level of spending is chosen.696  PART 4   •  Information, Market Failure, and the Role of Government
But will the preference of the median voter be the efficient level of spending? In 
this case yes, because $1200 is efficient. But the preference of the median voter is often not the efficient spending level. Suppose the third citizen’s preferences were 
the same as the second’s. In that case, although the median voter’s choice would still be $1200 per pupil, the efficient level of spending would be less than $1200 (because the efficient level involves an average of the preferences of all three citi-zens). In this case, majority rule would lead to too much spending on education. If we reversed the example so that the first and second citizens’ preferences were identical, majority rule would generate too little educational spending.
Thus, although majority-rule voting allows the preferences of the median 
voter to determine referenda outcomes, these outcomes need not be economi-cally efficient. Majority rule is inefficient because it weighs each citizen’s pref-erence equally: The efficient outcome weighs each citizen’s vote by his or her strength of preference.
SUMMARY
 1. An externality occurs when a producer or a consumer 
affects the production or consumption activities of oth-ers in a manner that is not directly reflected in the mar-ket. Externalities cause market inefficiencies because they inhibit the ability of market prices to convey accu-rate information about how much to produce and how much to buy.
 2. Pollution is a common example of an externality that 
leads to market failure. It can be corrected by emis-sions standards, emissions fees, marketable emissions permits, or by encouraging recycling. When there is uncertainty about costs and benefits, any one of these mechanisms can be preferable, depending on the shapes of the marginal social cost and marginal benefit curves.
 3. Sometimes it is the accumulated stock of a pollutant, 
rather than current level of emissions, that causes damage. An example of such stock externality is the buildup of greenhouse gases, which may lead to global warming.
 4. Inefficiencies due to market failure may be eliminated 
through private bargaining among the affected par-ties. According to the Coase theorem, the bargaining solution will be efficient when property rights are clearly specified, when transactions costs are zero, and 
when there is no strategic behavior. But bargaining is unlikely to generate an efficient outcome because par-ties frequently behave strategically.
 5. Common property resources are not controlled by a 
single person and can be used without a price being paid. As a result of free usage, an externality is created in which current overuse of the resource harms those who might use it in the future.
 6. Goods that private markets are not likely to produce 
efficiently are either nonrival or nonexclusive. A good 
is nonrival if for any given level of production, the 
marginal cost of providing it to an additional con-sumer is zero. A good is nonexclusive if it is expensive or impossible to exclude people from consuming it. Public goods are both nonrival and nonexclusive.
 7. A public good is provided efficiently when the vertical 
sum of the individual demands for the good is equal to the marginal cost of producing it.
 8. Majority-rule voting is one way for citizens to voice 
their preference for public goods. Under majority rule, the level of spending provided will be that preferred by the median voter. This level need not be the effi-cient outcome.
QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW
 1. Which of the following describes an externality and 
which does not? Explain the difference.
 a. A policy of restricted coffee exports in Brazil causes 
the U.S. price of coffee to rise—an increase which in turn also causes the price of tea to rise.
 b. An advertising blimp distracts a motorist who then 
hits a telephone pole. 2. Compare and contrast the following three mechanisms 
for treating pollution externalities when the costs and benefits of abatement are uncertain: (a) an emissions fee, (b) an emissions standard, and (c) a system of transferable emissions permits.
 3. When do externalities require government intervention? 
When is such intervention unlikely to be necessary?CHAPTER 18   •  Externalities and Public Goods  697
 4. Consider a market in which a firm has monopoly 
power. Suppose in addition that the firm produces under the presence of either a positive or a negative externality. Does the externality necessarily lead to a greater misallocation of resources?
 5. Externalities arise solely because individuals are 
unaware of the consequences of their actions. Do you agree or disagree? Explain.
 6. To encourage an industry to produce at the socially 
optimal level, the government should impose a unit tax on output equal to the marginal cost of production. True or false? Explain.
 7. George and Stan live next door to each other. George 
likes to plant flowers in his garden, but every time he does, Stan’s dog comes over and digs them up. Stan’s dog is causing the damage, so if economic efficiency is to be achieved, it is necessary that Stan pay to put up a fence around his yard to confine the dog. Do you agree or disagree? Explain.
 8. An emissions fee is paid to the government, whereas 
an injurer who is sued and held liable pays damages directly to the party harmed by an externality. What differences in the behavior of victims might you expect to arise under these two arrangements? 9. Why does free access to a common property resource 
generate an inefficient outcome?
 10. Public goods are both nonrival and nonexclusive. 
Explain each of these terms and show clearly how they differ from each other.
 11. A village is located next to 1000 acres of prime grazing 
land. The village presently owns the land and allows all residents to graze cows freely. Some members of the village council have suggested that the land is being overgrazed. Is this likely to be true? These same members have also suggested that the village should either require grazers to purchase an annual permit or sell off the land to the grazers.

the fishing fleet, should a government wishing to maximize the net value of the catch grant them licenses? Why or why not?APPENDIX
This appendix explains the basics of multiple regression analysis , using an 
example to illustrate its application in economics.1 Multiple regression is a 
 statistical procedure for quantifying economic relationships and testing hypoth-eses about them.
In a linear regression,  the relationships are of the following form:
Y=b
0+b1X1+b2X2+g+bkXk+e  (A.1)
Equation (A.1) relates a dependent  variable Y to several independent  (or explan-
atory ) variables, X1, X2,…For example, in an equation with two independent 
variables, Y might be the demand for a good, X1 its price, and X2 income. The 
equation also includes an error term e  that represents the collective influence 
of any omitted variables that may also affect Y (for example, prices of other 
goods, the weather, unexplainable shifts in consumers’ tastes, etc.). Data are available for Y and the Xs, but the error term is assumed to be unobservable.
Note that equation (A.1) must be linear in the parameters , but it need not be 
linear in the variables. For example, if equation (A.1) represented a demand function, Y might be the logarithm of quantity (log Q), X
1 the logarithm of price 
(log P), and X2 the logarithm of income (log I):
 log Q=b0+b1 log P+b2 log I+e  (A.2)
Our objective is to obtain estimates  of the parameters b0, b1,…, bk that provide a 
“best fit” to the data. We explain how this is done below.
An Example
Suppose we wish to explain and then forecast quarterly automobile sales in the United States. Let’s start with a simplified case in which sales S (in billions of 
dollars) is the dependent variable that will be explained. The only explanatory variable is the price of new automobiles P (measured by a new car price index 
scaled so that 1967 = 100). We could write this simple model as
S=b
0+b1P+e  (A.3)
In equation (A.3), b0 and b1 are the parameters to be determined from the 
data, and e is the random error term. The parameter b0 is the intercept, while • multiple regression analysis

7001For a textbook treatment of applied econometrics, it’s hard to think of a better reference than 
R. S. Pindyck and D. L. Rubinfeld, Econometric Models and Economic Forecasts , 4th ed. (New York: 
McGraw-Hill, 1998).APPENDIX   •  The Basics of Regression  701
b1 is the slope: It measures the effect of a change in the new car price index on 
automobile sales.
If there is no error term, the relationship between S and P would be a straight 
line that describes the systematic relationship between the two variables. However, because not all the actual observations fall on the line, the error term e 
is required to account for omitted factors.
Estimation
In order to choose values for the regression parameters, we need a criterion for a “best fit.” The criterion most often used is to minimize the sum of squared residuals  
between the actual values of Y and the fitted  values for Y obtained after equation 
(A.1) has been estimated. This is called the least-squares criterion.  If we denote 
the estimated parameters (or coefficients ) for the model in (A.1) by 
bn0, bn1, c, bnk, 
then the fitted  values for Y are given by
Yn=bn0+bn1X1+g+bnkXk (A.4)
Figure A.1 illustrates this for our example, in which there is a single inde-
pendent variable. The data are shown as a scatter plot of points with sales on the vertical axis and price on the horizontal. The fitted regression line is drawn through the data points. The fitted value for sales associated with any particular value for the price values P
i is given by Sni=bn0+bn1Pi (at point B).
For each data point, the regression residual  is the difference between the 
actual and fitted value of the dependent variable. The residual, eni, associated 
with data point A in the figure, is given by eni=Si-Sni. The parameter  values 
are chosen so that when all the residuals are squared and then added, the resulting sum is minimized. In this way, positive errors and negative errors are treated symmetrically; large errors are given a more-than- proportional weight.• least-squares criterion

As we will see shortly, this criterion lets us do some simple statistical tests to 
help interpret the regression.
As an example of estimation, let’s return to the two-variable model of auto 
sales given by equation (A.3). The result of fitting this equation using the least-squares criterion is
Sn=-25.5 +0.57P (A.5)
In equation (A.5), the intercept -225.5 indicates that if the price index were zero, 
sales would be $ -225.5 billion. The slope parameter indicates that a 1-unit increase 
in the price index for new cars leads to a $0.57 billion increase in auto sales. This rather surprising result—an upward-sloping demand curve—is inconsistent with economic theory and should make us question the validity of our model.
Let’s expand the model to consider the possible effects of two additional 
explanatory variables: personal income I (in billions of dollars) and the rate of 
interest R (the three-month Treasury bill rate). The estimated regression when 
there are three explanatory variables is
Sn=51.1 -0.42P+0.046 I-0.84R (A.6)
The importance of including all relevant variables in the model is suggested 
by the change in the regression results after the income and interest rate vari-ables are added. Note that the coefficient of the P variable has changed sub-
stantially, from 0.57 to -0.42. The coefficient -0.42 measures the effect of an 
increase in price on sales, with the effect of interest rates and income held constant . 
The negative price coefficient is consistent with a downward-sloping demand curve. Clearly, the failure to control for interest rates and income leads to the false conclusion that sales and price are positively related.
The income coefficient, 0.046, tells us that for every $1 billion increase in personal 
income in the United States, automobile sales are likely to increase by $46 million (or $0.046 billion). The interest rate coefficient reflects the fact that for every one percentage point increase in the rate of interest, automobile sales are likely to fall by $840 million. Clearly, automobile sales are very sensitive to the cost of borrowing.
Statistical Tests
Our estimates of the true (but unknown) parameters are numbers that depend on the set of observations that we started with—that is, with our sample.  With a 
different sample we would obtain different estimates.
2 If we continue to collect 
more and more samples and generate additional estimates, the estimates of each parameter will follow a probability distribution. This distribution can be sum-marized by a mean  and a measure of dispersion around that mean, a standard 
deviation that we refer to as the standard error of the coefficient .
Least-squares has several desirable properties. First, it is unbiased . Intuitively, 
this means that if we could run our regression over and over again with dif-ferent samples, the average of the many estimates that we obtained for each coefficient would equal the true parameter. Second, least-squares is consistent . 
In other words, if our sample were very large, we would obtain estimates that came very close to the true parameters.• sample  Set of observations 
for study, drawn from a larger universe.
2The least-squares formula that generates these estimates is called the least-squares estimator , and its 
values vary from sample to sample.APPENDIX   •  The Basics of Regression  703
In econometric work, we often assume that the error term, and therefore the 
estimated parameters, are normally distributed. The normal distribution has the property that the area within 1.96 standard errors of its mean is equal to 95 percent of the total area. With this information, we can ask the following question: Can we construct an interval around b
n such that there is a 95-percent probability that 
the true parameter lies within that interval? The answer is yes, and this 95-percent confidence interval  is given by
bn{1.96 (standard error of bn) (A.7)
Thus, when working with an estimated regression equation, we must not only 
look at the point  estimates but also examine the standard errors of the coeffi-
cients to determine bounds for the true parameters.
3
If a 95-percent confidence interval contains 0, then the true parameter b may 
actually be zero (even if our estimate is not). This result implies that the cor-responding independent variable may not really affect the dependent variable, 
even if we thought it did. We can test the hypothesis that a true parameter is actually equal to 0 by looking at its t-statistic , which is defined as
t= bn
Standard error of  bn (A.8)
If the t-statistic is less than 1.96 in magnitude, the 95-percent confidence interval 
around bn must include 0. This means that we cannot reject the hypothesis that 
the true parameter b equals 0. We therefore say that our estimate, whatever it 
may be, is not statistically significant . Conversely, if the t-statistic is greater than 
1.96 in absolute value, we reject the hypothesis that b = 0 and call our estimate 
statistically significant .
Equation (A.9) shows the multiple regression for the auto sales model (equa-
tion A.6) with a set of standard errors and t-statistics added:
Sn=51.1    -0.42P   +0.046 I   -0.84R
         (9.4)      (0.13)     (0.006)      (0.32)
 t=5.44    -3.23       7.67    -2.63 (A.9)
The standard error of each estimated parameter is given in parentheses just 
below the estimate, and the corresponding t-statistics appear below that.
Let’s begin by considering the price variable. The standard error of 0.13 is 
small relative to the coefficient -0.42. In fact, we can be 95 percent certain that the 
true value of the price coefficient is on the interval given by -0.42 plus or minus 
1.96 standard deviations (i.e., -0.42 plus or minus [1.96][0.13] = -0.42 ± 0.25). 
This puts the true value of the coefficient between -0.17 and -0.67. Because this 
range does not include zero, the effect of price is both significantly different from zero and negative. We can also arrive at this result from the t-statistic. The t of 
-3.23 reported in equation (A.9) for the price variable is equal to -0.42 divided 
by 0.13. Because this t-statistic exceeds 1.96 in absolute value, we conclude that 
price is a significant determinant of auto sales.
3When there are fewer than 100 observations, we multiply the standard error by a number some-
what larger than 1.96.704  APPENDIX   •  The Basics of Regression
Note that the income and interest rate variables are also significantly differ-
ent from zero. The regression results tell us that an increase in income is likely to have a statistically significant positive effect on auto sales, whereas an increase in interest rates will have a statistically significant negative effect.
Goodness of Fit
Reported regression results usually contain information that tells us how closely the regression line fits the data. One statistic, the standard error of the regression (SER) , 
is an estimate of the standard deviation of the regression error term e. Whenever all 
the data points lie on the regression line, the SER is zero. Other things being equal, the larger the standard error of the regression, the poorer the fit of the data to the regression line. To decide whether the SER is large or small, we compare it in mag-nitude with the mean of the dependent variable. This comparison provides a mea-sure of the relative  size of the SER, a more meaningful statistic than its absolute size.
R-squared ( R
2), the percentage of the variation in the dependent variable 
that is accounted for by all the explanatory variables, measures the overall  goodness-of-fit of the multiple regression equation.
4 Its value ranges from 0 to 1. 
An R2 of 0 means that the independent variables explain none of the variation of 
the dependent variable; an R2 of 1 means that the independent variables explain 
the variation perfectly. The R2 for the sales equation (A.9) is 0.94. This tells us 
that the three independent variables explain 94 percent of the variation in sales.
Note that a high R2 does not by itself mean that the variables actually included 
in the model are the appropriate ones. First, the R2 varies with the types of 
data being studied. Time series data with substantial upward growth usually  generate much higher R
2s than do cross-section data. Second, the underlying 
economic theory provides a vital check. If a regression of auto sales on the price of wheat happened to yield a high R
2, we would question the model’s reliability. 
Why? Because our theory tells us that changes in the price of wheat have little or no effect on automobile sales.
The overall reliability of a regression result depends on the formulation of the 
model. When studying an estimated regression, we should consider things that might make the reported results suspicious. First, have variables that should appear in the relationship been omitted? That is, is the specification  of the equation 
wrong? Second, is the functional form of the equation correct? For instance, should variables be in logarithms? Third, is there another relationship that relates one of the explanatory variables (say X) to the dependent variable Y? If so, X and Y are 
jointly determined, and we must deal with a two-equation model, not one with a single equation. Finally, does adding or removing one or two data points result in a major change in the estimated coefficients—i.e., is the equation robust?  If not, we 
should be very careful not to overstate the importance or reliability of the results.
Economic Forecasting
A forecast is a prediction about the values of the dependent variable, given information about the explanatory variables. Often, we use regression models  to generate ex ante forecasts , in which we predict values of the dependent • standard error of the

similar information about goodness of fit, because R2 = 1-SER2/Variance (Y).APPENDIX   •  The Basics of Regression  705
 variable beyond the time period over which the model has been estimated. If 
we know the values of the explanatory variables, the forecast is unconditional ; if 
they must be predicted as well, the forecast is conditional  on these predictions. 
Sometimes ex post  forecasts, in which we predict what the value of the depen-
dent variable would have been if the values of the independent variables had been different, can be useful. An ex post  forecast has a forecast period such that 
all values of the dependent and explanatory variables are known. Thus ex post  
forecasts can be checked against existing data and provide a direct means of evaluating a model.
For example, reconsider the auto sales regression discussed above. In gen-
eral, the forecasted value for auto sales is given by
Sn=bn
0+bn1P+bn2I+bn3R+en (A.10)
where en is our prediction for the error term. Without additional information, we 
usually take en to be zero.
Then, to calculate the forecast, we use the estimated sales equation:
Sn=51.1 -0.42P+0.046 I-0.84R (A.11)
We can use (A.11) to predict sales when, for example, P = 100, I = $1 trillion, and 
R = 8 percent. Then,
Sn=51.1 -0.42(100) +0.046(1000  billion) -0.84(8) =$48.4  billion
Note that $48.4 billion is an ex post  forecast for a time when P = 100, I = $1 trillion,
and R = 8 percent.
To determine the reliability of ex ante  and ex post  forecasts, we use the standard 
error of forecast (SEF) . The SEF measures the standard deviation of the forecast 
error within a sample in which the explanatory variables are known with cer-tainty. Two sources of error are implicit in the SEF. The first is the error term itself, because enmay not equal 0 in the forecast period. The second source arises 
because the estimated parameters of the regression model may not be exactly equal to the true parameters.
As an application, consider the SEF of $7.0 billion associated with equation 
(A.11). If the sample size is large enough, the probability is roughly 95 percent that the predicted sales will be within 1.96 standard errors of the forecasted value. In this case, the 95-percent confidence interval is $48.4 billion ± $14.0 bil-lion, i.e., from $34.4 billion to $62.4 billion.
Now suppose we wish to forecast automobile sales for some date in the future, 
such as 2007. To do so, the forecast must be conditional because we need to pre-dict the values for the independent variables before calculating the forecast for automobile sales. Assume, for example, that our predictions of these variables are as follows: Pn=200,
 In=$5 trillion, and Rn=10 percent. Then, the forecast is 
given by Pn=51.1 -0.42(200) +0.046(5000  billion) -0.84(10) =$188.7  billion
. Here $188.7 billion is an ex ante  conditional forecast.
Because we are predicting the future, and because the explanatory variables 
do not lie close to the means of the variables throughout our period of study, the SEF is equal to $8.2 billion, which is somewhat greater than the SEF that we calculated previously.
5 The 95-percent confidence interval associated with our 
forecast is the interval from $172.3 billion to $205.1 billion.

EXAMPLE A.1  THE DEMAND FOR COAL
Suppose we want to estimate the demand for bituminous coal (given by 
sales in tons per year, COAL) and then use the relationship to forecast future coal sales. We would expect the quantity demanded to depend on the price 
of coal (given by the Producer Price Index for coal, PCOAL) and on the price of a close substitute for coal (given by the Producer Price Index for natural 
gas, PGAS). Because coal is used to produce steel and electricity, we would 
also expect the level of steel production (given by the Federal Reserve Board 
Index of iron and steel production, FIS) and electricity production (given by 
the Federal Reserve Board Index of electric utility production, FEU) to be 
important demand determinants.
Our model of coal demand is therefore given by the following equation:
COAL =b
0+b1 PCOAL +b2 PGAS +b3 FIS+b4 FEU +e
From our theory, we would expect b1 to be negative because the demand 
curve for coal is downward sloping. We would also expect b2 to be positive 
because a higher price of natural gas should lead industrial consumers of 
energy to substitute coal for natural gas. Finally, we would expect both b3 
and b4 to be positive because the greater the production of steel and elec-
tricity, the greater the demand for coal.
This model was estimated using monthly time-series data covering eight 
years. The results (with t-statistics in parentheses) are
COAL =12,262 +92.34  FIS+118.57  FEU -48.90  PCOAL +118.91  PGAS
(3.51)   (6.46)         (7.14)           ( -3.82)               (3.18)
R2=0.692 SER=120,000
All the estimated coefficients have the signs that economic theory 
would predict. Each coefficient is also statistically significantly different 
from zero because the t-statistics are all greater than 1.96 in absolute 
value. The R2 of 0.692 says that the model explains more than two-thirds 
of the variation in coal sales. The standard error of the regression SER is equal to 120,000 tons of coal. Because the mean level of coal produc-
tion was 3.9 million tons, SER represents approximately 3 percent of the 
mean value of the dependent variable. This suggests a reasonably good 
model fit.
Now suppose we want to use the estimated coal demand equation to 
forecast coal sales up to one year into the future. To do so, we substitute 
values for each of the explanatory variables for the 12-month forecast-
ing period into the estimated equation. We also estimate the standard 
error of forecast (the estimate is 0.17 million tons) and use it to calcu-
late 95-percent confidence intervals for the forecasted values of coal 
demand. Some representative forecasts and confidence intervals are 
given in Table A.1.APPENDIX   •  The Basics of Regression  707

measures the effect on the dependent variable of a change in the corresponding independent variable, holding the effects of all other independent variables 
constant.
 4. A t-test can be used to test the hypothesis that a par-
ticular slope coefficient is different from zero.
 5. The overall fit of the regression equation can be evalu-
ated using the standard error of the regression (SER) (a value close to zero means a good fit) or R
2 (a value 
close to one means a good fit).
 6. Regression models can be used to forecast future 
values of the dependent variable. The standard error of forecast (SEF) measures the accuracy of the forecast.Glossary

CHAPTER 1
1. a. False.  There is little or no substitutability across geo-
graphical regions of the United States. A consumer in Los Angeles, for example, will not travel to Houston, Atlanta, or New York for lunch just because ham-burger prices are lower in those cities. Likewise, a McDonald’s or Burger King in New York cannot sup-ply hamburgers in Los Angeles, even if prices were higher in Los Angeles. In other words, a fast-food price increase in New York will affect neither the quantity demanded nor the quantity supplied in Los Angeles or other parts of the country.
 b. False.  Although consumers are unlikely to travel 
across the country to buy clothing, suppliers can easily move clothing from one part of the country to another. Thus if clothing prices were substantially higher in Atlanta than Los Angeles, clothing com-panies could shift supplies to Atlanta, which would 
reduce the price there.
 c. False.  Although some consumers might be die-hard 
Coke or Pepsi loyalists, there are many consumers who will substitute one for the other based on price differences. Thus there is a single market for colas.
CHAPTER 2
2. a. With each price increase of $20, the quantity 
demanded decreases by 2. Therefore, (/H9004QD//H9004P)=
-2/20 =-0.1. At P = 80, quantity demanded equals 
20 and ED=(8/20)( -0.1) =-0.40. Similarly, 
at P = 100, quantity demanded equals 18 and 
ED=(100/18)( -0.1) =-0.56.
 b. With each price increase of $20, quantity supplied 
increases by 2. Therefore, (/H9004QS//H9004P)=2/20 =0.1. 
At P=80, quantity supplied equals 16 and ES =
(80/16)(0.1) =0.5. Similarly, at P=100, quantity 
supplied equals 18 and ES=(100/18)(0.1) =0.56. 
 c. The equilibrium price and quantity are found where 
the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded at the same price. From the table, the P*=$100 and 
the Q*=18
 million.
 d. With a price ceiling of $80, consumers want 
20 million, but producers supply only 16 million, for a shortage of 4 million.3.  If Brazil and Indonesia add 200 million bushels of 
wheat to U.S. wheat demand, the new demand curve will be Q+200, or Q
D=(3244 -283P)+200 =
3444 -283P.
Equate supply and the new demand to find the 
new equilibrium price. 1944 +207P=3444 -283P, 
or 490P=1500 , and thus P /H11005 $3.06 per bushel. To 
find the equilibrium quantity, substitute the price into either the supply or demand equation. Using demand, 
Q
D=3444 -283(3.06) =2578  million  bushels.
5. a. Total demand is Q=3244 -283P; domestic 
demand is QD=1700 -107P; subtracting domestic 
demand from total demand gives export demand 
QE=1544 -176P. The initial market equilibrium 
price (as given in example) is P*=$2.65. With a 
40-percent decrease in export demand, total  demand becomes Q=Q
D+0.6QE=1700 -107P
+ 0.6(1544 -176P)=2626.4 -212.6 P. Demand is 
equal to supply. Therefore:
2626.4 -212.6 P=1944 +207P
682.4 =419.6 P
  So P= 682.4
419.6 =$1.626   or  $1.63. At this price, 
Q=2281. Yes, farmers should be worried. With this 
drop in quantity and price, revenue goes from $6609 million to $3718 million.
 b. If the U.S. government supports a price of $3.50, the 
market is not in equilibrium. At this support price, demand is equal to 2626.4 -212.6(3.5) =1882.3 
and supply is 1944 +207(3.5) =2668.5. There is 
excess supply (2668.5 -1882.3 =786.2) which 
the government must buy, costing $3.50(786.2) = 
$2751.7
 million.
8. a. To derive the new demand curve, we follow the 
same procedure as in Section 2.6. We know that 
ED=-b(P*/Q*); substituting ED=-0.75,  P*=$3, 
and Q*=18 gives -0.75 =-b(3/18)  so that b = 
4.5. Substituting this value into the equation for the linear demand curve, Q
D=a-bP, we have 
18=a-4.5(3). So a=31.5. The new demand 
curve is QD=31.5 -4.5P.

Jones has a higher  MRS of R for H than Smith has. 
Jones’ indifference curves are steeper than Smith’s at any point on the graph.
8. In Figure 3(b) we plot miles flown, M, against all other 
goods, G, in dollars. The slope of the budget line is 
-P
M/PG. The price of miles flown changes as number 
of miles flown changes, so the budget curve is kinked at 25,000 and 50,000 miles. Suppose P
M is $1 per mile 
for … 25,000 miles, then PM=$0.75 for 25,000 6M 
… 50,000, and PM = $.50 for M > 50,000. Also, let PG = 
$1. Then the slope of the first segment is -1, the slope 
of the second segment is -0.75, and the slope of the 
last segment is -0.5. b. To determine the effect of a 20-percent decline in cop-
per demand, we note that the quantity demanded is 80 percent of what it would be otherwise for every price. Multiplying the right-hand side of the demand curve by 0.8, Q
D=(0.8)(31.5 -4.5P)=25.2 -3.6P. 
Supply is still QS=-9+9P and demand is equal 
to supply. Solving, P*=$2.71 per pound. A decline 
in demand of 20 percent, therefore, entails a drop in price of 29 cents per pound, or 9.7 percent.
10. a. First, considering non-OPEC supply: S
C=Q*=19. 
With ES=0.05 and P*=$80, ES=d(P*/Q) implies 
d = 0.012. Substituting for d, SC=19, and P = 80 in 
the supply equation gives 19=c+(0.012) (80), 
so that c = 18.05. Hence, the supply curve is 
SC=18.05 +0.012 P. Similarly, since QD=32, 
ED=-b(P*/Q*)=-0.05 and b=0.020.  Substituting 
for b, QD = 32, and P = 80 in the demand equation 
gives 32=a-(0.020)(80), so that a = 33.6. Hence 
QD=33.6 -0.020 P.
 b. The long-run elasticities are: ES=0.30 and 
ED=-0.30. As above, ES=d(P*/Q*) and ED = 
-b(P*/Q*), implying 0.30 =d(80/19) and 
-0.30 =-b(80/32). So d = 0.07 and b = –0.12. Next 
solve for c and a: SC=c+dP and QD=a-bP, 
which implies that 19=c+(0.07)(80) and 
32=a-(0.12)(80). Therefore, c = 13.3 and a = 41.6.
 c. The discovery of new oil fields will increase OPEC 
supply by 2bb/yr, so SC = 19, SO = 15, and D = 34. 
The new short-run total supply curve is 
ST=33.05 +0.012 P. Demand is unchanged: 
D=33.6 -.020P. Since supply equals demand, 
33.05 +0.012 P=33.6 -.020P. Solving, P = $17.19 
per barrel. An increase in OPEC supply entails a drop in price of $62.81, or 79% in the short-run.
To analyze the long-run, use the new long- 
run supply curve, S
T=28.3 +0.071 P. Setting 
this equal to long-run demand gives: 28.3 + 
0.071  P=41.6 -0.120 P, so that P=$69.63 per 
barrel, only $10.37 per barrel (13%) less than the  original long-run price.

However, she did not choose to return to her original 
bundle. We can therefore infer that she found a better bundle that gave her a higher level of utility.
13. a. The demand curve is a straight line with a vertical 
intercept of P = 15 and a horizontal intercept of Q = 30.
 b. If there were no toll, the price P would be 0, so that 
Q = 30.
 c. If the toll is $5, Q = 20. The consumer surplus lost is 
the difference between consumer surplus when P = 0 
and consumer surplus when P = 5, or $125.
CHAPTER 4—APPENDIX
1.  The first utility function can be represented as a series 
of straight lines; the second as a series of hyperbolas in the positive quadrant; and the third as a series of “L”s. Only the second utility function meets the definition of a strictly convex shape.
3.  The Slutsky equation is dX/dP
X=0X/0P*|U=U*
- X(/H9004X//H9004I), where the first term represents the 
substitution effect and the second term represents the income effect. With this type of utility function the consumer does not substitute one good for the other when the price changes, so the substitution effect is zero.

4.  The expected value is EV =(0.4)(100) +(0.3)(30)

- 40)2+(0.3)(30 -40)2+(0.3)( -30-40)2=2,940.
8.  Initially, total wealth is $450,000. We calculate 
expected wealth under three options. Under the safe 
option, E(U) =(450,000 +1.05*200,000).5=678. 
With the summer corn crop, E(U) =.7(250,000 +
500,000).5+.3(250,000 +50,000).5=770. Finally, 
with the drought resistant summer corn crop, E(U) =
.7(250,000 +450,000).5+.3(250,000 +350,000).5 =
818. The option with the highest expected utility is 
planting the drought resistant crop.CHAPTER 4
9. a. For computer chips, EP = -2, so -2 = %/H9004Q/10, 
and therefore % /H9004Q = -20. For disk drives, EP = -1, 
so a 10 percent increase in price will reduce sales by 10 percent. Sales revenue will decrease for com-puter chips because demand is elastic and price has increased. To estimate the change in rev-enue, let TR
1=P1Q1 be revenue before the price 
change and TR2=P2Q2 be revenue after the price 
change. Therefore /H9004TR =P2Q2-P1Q1, and thus 
/H9004TR =(1.1P1)(0.8 Q1)-P1Q1=-0.12P1Q1, or a 
12 percent decline. Sales revenue for disk drives will remain unchanged because demand elasticity is -1.
 b. Although we know the responsiveness of demand 
to change in price, we need to know the quantities and the prices of the products to determine total sales  revenues.
11. a. With small changes in price, the point elastic-
ity formula would be appropriate. But here, the price of food increases from $2 to $2.50, so arc elas-ticity should be used: E
p=(/H9004Q//H9004P)(P/Q). We 
know that Ep = -1, P = 2, /H9004P = .50, and Q = 5000. 
So, if there is no change in income, we can solve for 
/H9004Q: -1=(/H9004Q/.50) [((2 +.50)/2)/(5000 +/H9004Q/2)]
= (/H9004Q#2.50)/(10,000 +/H9004Q). We find that /H9004Q = 
-1000: she decreases her consumption of food from 
5000 to 4000 units.
 b. A tax rebate of $2500 implies an income increase of 
$2500. To calculate the response of demand to the tax rebate, we use the definition of the arc income elasticity: E
I=(/H9004Q//H9004I)(I/Q). We know that 
EI = 0.5, I = 25,000, /H9004I = 2500, and Q = 4000. We solve for 
/H9004Q:0.5 =(/H9004Q/2500)[((25,000 +27,500)/2)/(4000 +
(/H9004Q/2)]. Since /H9004Q = 195, she increases her consump-
tion of food from 4000 to 4195 units.
 c. Felicia is better off after the rebate. The amount of the 
rebate is enough to allow her to purchase her original bundle of food and other goods. Recall that originally she consumed 5000 units of food. When the price went up by fifty cents per unit, she needed an extra (5000)($0.50) = $2500 to afford the same quantity of 
food without reducing the quantity of the other goods consumed. This is the exact amount of the rebate.

isoquant, and hence the MRTS, we need to know 
the rate at which one input may be substituted for the other. Without the marginal product of each input, we cannot calculate the MRTS.
9. a. Let Q
1 be the output of DISK, Inc., Q2 be the output of 
FLOPPY, Inc., and X be equal amounts of capital and 
labor for the two firms. Then, Q1=10X0.5X0.5 =
10X(0.5+0.5)=10X and Q2=10X0.6X0.4 = 10X(0.6+0.4)
= 10X. Because Q1 = Q2, they both generate the same 
output with the same inputs.
b.  With capital fixed at 9 machine units, the production 
functions become Q1=30L0.5 and Q2=37.37 L0.4. 
Consider the following table:

  For each unit of labor above 1 unit, the marginal prod-
uct of labor is greater for DISK, Inc.
CHAPTER 7
4. a. Total cost, TC, is equal to fixed cost, FC, plus vari-
able cost, VC. Since the franchise fee, FF, is a fixed sum, the firm’s fixed costs increase by the fee. Then average cost, equal to (FC + VC)/ Q, and average 
fixed cost, equal to (FC/ Q), increase by the average 
franchise fee (FF/ Q). Average variable cost is unaf-
fected by the fee, as is marginal cost.
 b. When a tax t is imposed, variable costs increase by 
tQ. Average variable cost increases by t (fixed cost is 
constant), as does average (total) cost. Because total cost increases by t with each additional unit, mar-
ginal cost increases by t.
5.  It is probably referring to accounting profit; this is 
the standard concept used in most discussions of how firms are doing financially. In this case, the article points to a substantial difference between accounting and economic profits. It claims that, under the current labor contract, automakers must pay many workers even if they are not working. This implies that their wages are sunk  for the life 
of the contract. Accounting profits would subtract wages paid; economic profits would not, since they are sunk costs. Therefore automakers may be earn-ing economic profits on these sales, even if they have accounting losses.12.  To determine the total demand curve, we add 
up 100 standard demand curves and 100 rule of thumb demand curves: Q=100*(20 -P)+100*
(10
 if P 610 or 0 if P Ú10) =3000 -100P if P < 
10 and 2000 - 100P if P Ú10. The resulting total 
demand curve is given below.
CHAPTER 6
2. a. The average product of labor, AP, is equal to Q/L. 
The marginal product of labor, MP, is equal to

 b. This production process exhibits diminish-
ing returns to labor, which is characteristic of all  production functions with one fixed input. Each 
additional unit of labor yields a smaller increase in 
output than the last unit of labor.
 c. Labor’s negative marginal product can arise from con-
gestion in the chair manufacturer’s factory. As more 
laborers are using a fixed amount of capital, they get in each other’s way, decreasing output.

 b. Because the firm is a price taker, the imposition of the 
tax on only one firm does not change the market price. Given that the firm’s short-run supply curve is its  marginal cost curve (above average variable cost), and that the marginal cost curve has shifted up (or inward), the firm supplies less to the market at every price.
 c. If the tax is placed on a single firm, that firm will go 
out of business unless it was earning a positive eco-nomic profit before the tax.
CHAPTER 9
1. a. In free-market equilibrium, LS = LD. Solving, w = $4 
and LS = LD = 40. If the minimum wage is $5, then 
LS = 50 and LD = 30. The number of people employed 
will be given by the labor demand. So employers will hire 30 million workers.
 b. With the subsidy, only w - 1 is paid by the firm. The 
labor demand becomes L
D*=80-10(w-1). So 
w = $4.50 and L = 45.
4. a. Equating demand and supply, 28-2P=4 +
4P#P*=4 and Q* = 20.
 b. The 25-percent reduction would imply that farmers 
produce 15 billion bushels. To encourage farmers to withdraw their land from cultivation, the government must give them 5 billion bushels that they can sell on the market. Since the total supply to the  market is still 20 billion bushels, the market price remains at $4 per bushel. Farmers gain because they incur no costs for the 5 billion bushels received from the government. We calculate these cost savings by taking the area under the supply curve between 15 and 20 billion bushels. The prices when Q = 15 and when Q = 20 
are P = $2.75 and P = $4.00. The total cost of produc-
ing the last 5 billion bushels is therefore the area of a  trapezoid with a base of 20  - 15 = 5 billion and an 
average height of (2.75 + 4.00)/2 = 3.375. The area is 
5(3.375) = $16.875 billion.
 c. Taxpayers gain because the government does not 
have to pay to store the wheat for a year and then ship it to an underdeveloped country. The PIK Program can last only as long as wheat reserves last. But PIK assumes that the land removed from production can be restored to production at such time as the stock-piles are exhausted. If this cannot be done, consumers may eventually pay more for wheat-based products. Finally, farmers enjoy a windfall profit because they have no production costs.
10. a. To find the price of natural gas when the price of 
oil is $60 per barrel, equate the quantity demanded and quantity supplied of natural gas, and solve for P
G. The relevant equations are: Supply:  
Q=15.90 +0.72PG+0.05PO, Demand:  Q=0.02-
1.8PG+0.69PO. Using PO=$60, we get: 15.90 +
0.72PG+0.05(60) =0.02 -1.8PG+0.69(60), so the 
price of natural gas is PG=$8.94 . Substituting into 
the supply or the demand curve gives a free- market quantity of 25.34 Tcf. If a maximum price of  natural 10.  If the firm can produce one chair with either 4 hours 
of labor or 4 hours of machinery or any combination, then the isoquant is a straight line with a slope of -1
and intercepts at K = 4 and L = 4. The isocost line, 
TC =30L+15K, has a slope of -2 and intercepts at 
K=TC/15 and L=TC/30. The cost-minimizing 
point is a corner solution, where L = 0 and K = 4, and 
TC = $60.
CHAPTER 7—APPENDIX
1. a. Returns to scale refers to the relationship between out-
put and proportional increases in all inputs. If 
F(lL,lK)7lF(L,K), there are increasing returns to 
scale; if F(lL,lK)=lF(L,K), there are constant 
returns to scale; if F(lL,lK)6lF(L,K), there are 
decreasing returns to scale. Applying this to F(L,K)=K
2L, F(lL,lK) =(lK)2(lL)=l3K2L =
l3F(L,K)7lF(L,K). So, this production function 
exhibits increasing returns to scale.
 b. F(lL,lK)=10lK+5lL=lF(L,K). The production 
function exhibits constant returns to scale.
 c. F(lL,lK)=(lKlL)0.5=(l2)0.5=(KL)0.5=l(KL)0.5 =
lF(L,K). The production function exhibits constant 
returns to scale.
2.  The marginal product of labor is 100 K. The 
marginal product of capital is 100 L. The marginal 
rate of technical substitution is K/L. Set this equal 
to the ratio of the wage rate to the rental rate of  
capital: K/L=30/120 or L = 4K. Then sub-
stitute for L in the production function and 
solve for a K that yields an output of 1000 
units: 1000 =100K#4K. So, K=2.50.5, 
L=4#2.50.5, and total cost is equal to $379.20.
CHAPTER 8
4. a. Profit is maximized where marginal cost (MC) is equal 
to marginal revenue (MR). Here, MR is equal to $100. Setting MC equal to 100 yields a profit-maximizing quantity of 25.
 b. Profit is equal to total revenue ( PQ) minus total cost. 
So profit =PQ-200 -2Q
2. At P = 100 and Q = 25, 
profit = $1050.
 c. The firm produces in the short run if its revenues are 
greater than its variable costs. The firm’s short-run supply curve is its MC curve above minimum AVC. Here, AVC is equal to variable cost, 2 Q
2, divided by 
quantity, Q. So, AVC = 2Q. Also, MC is equal to 4 Q. 
So, MC is greater than AVC for any quantity greater than 0. This means that the firm produces in the short run as long as price is positive.
11.  The firm should produce where price is equal to 
 marginal cost so that: P=115 =15+4q=MC 
and q = 25. Profit is $800. Producer surplus is profit 
plus fixed cost, which is $1250.

cost curves shift up by $1.ANSWERS TO SELECTED EXERCISES   •  723
 b. Substituting the new price of 32.56 cents into the 
supply and demand equations, we find that the U.S. production of sugar would decrease to 13.54 billion pounds, while demand would increase to 23.54 bil-lion pounds, with the additional 10 billion pounds supplied by imports. In order to find the change in the consumer and producer surpluses, it might help to redraw the graph as Figure 9(a). The gain 
to producers is given by the area of trapezoid A: A=
11
2 *(32.56 -24)(8.2) 2+(13.54 -8.2) 
(32.56 -24) =$930 million, which is $500 million 
less than the producer gain when imports were lim-ited to 6.9 billion pounds.
To find the gain to consumers, we must find the 
change in the lost consumer surplus, given by the sum of trapezoid A, triangles B and C, and rectangle D. 
We’ve already found the area of trapezoid A. Triangle  
B=

2 (32.56 -24)(13.54 -8.2) =$228.52 million, 
triangle C=1

million, and rectangle D=(32.56 -24) 
(23.54 -13.54) =$856.34  million. The sum of A, B, 
C, and D is $2.09 billion. When imports were limited 
to 6.9 billion pounds, the loss in consumer surplus  
is $2.88 billion, meaning that consumers gain  about $790 million when imports are raised to  10 billion pounds.gas were set at $3, the quantity supplied would be 
21.06 Tcf and the quantity demanded would be 36.02 Tcf. To calculate the deadweight loss, we mea-sure the area of triangles B and C (see Figure 9.4). To 
find area B we must first determine the price on the 
demand curve when quantity equals 21.1. From the demand equation, 21.1 = 41.42  - 1.8P
G. Therefore, 
PG = $11.29. Area B equals (0.5)(25.3  - 21.1)(11.29  - 
8.94) = $4.9 billion, and area C is (0.5)(25.3  - 21.1)
(8.94  - 3) = $12.5 billion. The deadweight loss is 4.9 + 
12.5 = $17.4 billion.
 b. To find the price of oil that would yield a free 
market price of natural gas of $3, we set the quan-tity demanded equal to the quantity supplied, use  
P
G = $3, and solve for PO. Therefore, QS = 15.90 + 
0.72(3) + 0.05 PO = 0.02  - 1.8(3) + 0.69 PO = QD, or 
18.06 + 0.05 PG = -5.38 + 0.69 PO, so that 0.64 PO = 23.44 
and PO = $36.63. This yields a free market price of 
natural gas of $3.
11. a. To find the new domestic price, we set the quantity 
demanded minus the quantity supplied equal to 10. Therefore, Q
D-QS=(29.73 -0.19P)-(-7.95 +
0.66P)=10. 0.85 P=27.68, meaning that P = 
32.56 cents. If imports had been expanded to 10 billion pounds, the U.S. price would have fallen by 3.44 cents.

area a, or (0.5)(200 - 100)(50) = $25 million, a loss of 
$24 million. Producer surplus increases by area b, 
or (100 - 60)(10) + (0.5)(100 - 60)(50 - 10) = $12 mil-
lion. Finally, because domestic production is equal to domestic demand at $1, no hula beans are imported and the government receives no revenue. The differ-ence between the loss of consumer surplus and the increase in producer surplus is deadweight loss which is $12 million.
13.  No, they would not. The clearest case is where labor 
markets are competitive. With either design of the tax, the wedge between supply and demand must total 12.4 percent of the wage paid. It does not  matter whether the tax is imposed entirely on the workers (shifting the effective supply curve up by 12.4 percent) or entirely on the employers (shifting the  effective demand curve down by 12.4 percent). The same applies to any com-bination of the two that sums to 12.4 percent.
CHAPTER 10
2.  There are three important factors: (1) How similar 
are the products offered by Caterpillar’s competi-tors? If they are close substitutes, a small increase in price could induce customers to switch to the competition. (2) What is the age of the existing stock of tractors? A 5-percent price increase induces a smaller drop in demand with an older population of tractors. (3) As a capital input in agricultural produc-tion, what is the expected profitability of the agricul-tural sector? If expected farm incomes are falling, an increase in tractor prices induces a greater decline in demand than one would estimate with information on past sales and prices.
4. a. Optimal production is found by setting marginal rev-
enue equal to marginal cost. If the demand function is linear, 
P=a-bQ (here, a = 120 and b = 0.02), so that 
MR = a /H11002 2bQ = 100 /H11002 2(0.02) Q. c. The deadweight loss is given by the 
sum of the areas of triangles B and C: 
B=1
2 (32.56 -24)(13.54 -8.2) =$228.52 million 
and C=1
2 (32.56 -24)(25.4 -23.54) =$79.47 mil-
lion. B+C=$228.52 +$79.47 =$308 million. 
To find the change in deadweight loss from Example 9.6, we subtract this from the original deadweight loss of $614.22 million. $614.22 million – $308 million = $306.22 million. In other words, raising the import quota to 10 billion pounds per year reduces the dead-weight loss by $306.22 million.
The gain to foreign producers is given by 
the area of rectangle D. When imports are lim-
ited to 6.9 billion pounds, D = $836.4 million; 
when imports are raised to 10 billion pounds, 
D=(32.56 -24)(23.54 -13.54) =$856.34 million. 
Because the U.S. price of sugar has increased, for-eign producers are able to earn higher profits – about $19.94 million, to be exact.
12.  First, equate supply and demand to determine equilib-
rium quantity: 50 + Q = 200 - 2Q, or Q
EQ = 50 (million 
pounds). Substitute QEQ = 50 into either the supply or 
demand equation to determine price: PS = 50 + 50 = 
100 and PD = 200 - (2)(50) = 100. Thus, the equilibrium 
price P is $1 (100 cents). However, the world market 
price is 60 cents. At this price, the domestic quantity supplied is 60 = 50 - Q
S or QS = 10, and domestic 
demand is 60 = 200 - 2QD or QD = 70. Imports equal 
the difference between domestic demand and supply, or 60 million pounds. If Congress imposes a tariff of 40 cents, the effective price of imports increases to $1. At $1, domestic producers satisfy domestic demand and imports fall to zero.
As shown in Figure 9(b), consumer surplus before 
the tariff is equal to area a + b + c, or (0.5)(200 + 60)
(70) = 4,900 million cents or $49 million. After the  tariff,

 c. Rebate coupons with food processors separate con-

8. a. A monopolist with two markets should pick quantities 
in each market so that the marginal revenues in both markets are equal to one another and equal to marginal cost. Marginal cost is the slope of the total cost curve, 40. To determine marginal revenues in each market, we solve for price as a function of quantity. Then we substi-tute this expression for price into the equation for total revenue. P
NY=240 -4QNY, and  
PLA=200 -2QLA. Then total revenues are 
TR NY=QNYPNY=QNY(240 -4QNY), and TR LA=
QLAPLA=QLA(200 -2QLA). The marginal revenues 
are the slopes of the total revenue curves: MR NY=
240 -8QNY and MR LA=200 -4QLA. Next, we set 
each marginal revenue to marginal cost ( = 40), imply-
ing QNY = 25 and QLA = 40. With these quantities, we 
solve for price in each market: PNY=240 -(4)(25) =
$140 and PLA=200 -(2)(40) =$120.
 b. With the new satellite, Sal can no longer separate 
the two markets. The total demand function is the horizontal summation of the two markets. Above a price of $200, the total demand is just the New York demand function. Below a price of $200, we add the two demands: Q
T = 60 - 0.25 P + 100 - 0.50 P = 160 - 
0.75P. Sal maximizes profit by choosing a quantity Total cost = 25,000 + 60Q, so MC = 60. Setting 
MR = MC implies 120 /H11002 0.04 Q = 60, so Q = 1500. 
Substituting into the demand function, P = 120 /H11002 
(0.02)(1500) = 90 cents. Total profit is (90)(1500) /H11002 
(60)(1500) /H11002 25,000, or $200 per week.
 b. Suppose initially that the consumers must pay the 
tax. Since the price (including the tax) that consum-ers would be willing to pay remains unchanged, the demand function can be written P + t = 120 /H11002 
0.02Q /H11002 t. Because the tax increases the price of 
each unit, total revenue for the monopolist increases by t, so MR = 120 /H11002 0.04 Q /H11002 t, where t = 14 cents. 
To determine the profit-maximizing output with 
tax, equate marginal revenue and marginal cost: 120 /H11002 0.04 Q - 14 = 60, or Q = 1150 units.
From the demand function, average revenue = 
120 /H11002 (0.02)(1150) /H11002 14 = 83 cents. Total profit is 1450 
cents or $14.50 per week.
7. a. The monopolist’s pricing rule is: ( P /H11002 MC)/P = 
/H110021/E
D, using /H110022 for the elasticity and 40 for price, 
solve to find MC = 20.
 b. In percentage terms, the mark-up is 50%, since mar-
ginal cost is 50% of price.
 c. Total revenue is price times quantity, or ($40)
(800) = $32,000. Total cost is equal to average cost 
times quantity, or ($15)(800) = $12,000, so profit is 
$20,000. Producer surplus is profit plus fixed cost, or $22,000.
10. a. Pro: Although Alcoa controlled about 90 percent 
of primary aluminum production in the United States, secondary aluminum production by recyclers accounted for 30 percent of the total aluminum sup-ply. It should be possible for a much larger proportion of aluminum supply to come from secondary sources. Therefore the price elasticity of demand for Alcoa’s primary aluminum is much higher than we would expect. In many applications, other metals, such as copper and steel, are feasible substitutes for alumi-num. Here, the demand elasticity Alcoa faces may be lower than we would otherwise expect.
 b. Con:  The stock of potential supply is limited. 
Therefore, by keeping a stable high price, Alcoa could reap monopoly profits. Furthermore, since Alcoa had originally produced the metal reappearing as recycled scrap, it would have taken into account in its output decisions the effect of scrap reclamation on future prices. Hence, it exerted effective monopolistic control over the secondary metal supply.
 c. Alcoa was not ordered to sell any of its U.S. produc-
tion facilities. Rather, (1) it was barred from bidding for two primary aluminum plants constructed by the government during World War II; and (2) it was ordered to divest itself of its Canadian subsidiary, which became Alcan.

3250 P2. Then TR =128,000 +18,000 P-2750 P2. 
Marginal cost is zero, so setting /H9004TR/ /H9004P=18,000 -
5500 P=0 implies a price of $3.27 per hour. Then total 
revenue is equal to $157,455 per week, which is more than the $150,000 per week with only serious play-ers. The club owner should set annual dues at $1053, charge $3.27 for court time, and earn profits of $7.67 million per year.
11.  Mixed bundling is often the ideal strategy when 
demands are only somewhat negatively correlated and/or when marginal production costs are sig-nificant. The following tables present the reservation prices of the three consumers and the profits from the three strategies:
RESERVATION PRICE
FOR 1 FOR 2 TOTAL
Consumer A $ 3.25 $ 6.00 $ 9.25
Consumer B 8.25 3.25 11.50
Consumer C 10.00 10.00 20.00

Pure bundling — — $ 9.25 27.75
Mixed bundling 10.00 6.00 11.50 29.00
  The profit-maximizing strategy is to use mixed 
 bundling.
15. a. For each strategy, the optimal prices and profits are
PRICE 1 PRICE 2 BUNDLED PROFIT
Sell separately $80.00 $80.00 — $320.00
Pure bundling — — $120.00 480.00
Mixed bundling 94.95 94.95 120.00 429.00
Pure bundling dominates mixed bundling because 
with marginal costs of zero, there is no reason to exclude purchases of both goods by all customers.so that MR = MC. Marginal revenue is 213.33 - 
2.67Q. Setting this equal to marginal cost implies 
a profit-maximizing quantity of 65 with a price of $126.67. In the New York market, quantity is equal to 60 - 0.25(126.67) = 28.3, and in the Los Angeles 
market, quantity is equal to 100 - 0.50(126.67) = 36.7. 
Together, 65 units are purchased at a price of $126.67.
 c. Sal is better off in the situation with the highest profit, 
which occurs in part (a) with price discrimination. Under price discrimination, profit is equal to 
p=P
NYQNY+PLAQLA-[1000 +40(QNY+QLA)], 
or p=$140(25) +$120(40) -[1000 +40(25 +40)]
= $4700. Under the market conditions in part 
(b), profit is p=PQ T-[1000 -40QT], 
or p=$126.67(65) -[1000 +40(65)] =$4633.33. 
Therefore, Sal is better off when the two markets are separated. Under the market conditions in (a), the con-sumer surpluses in the two cities are 
CS
NY=(0.5)(25)(240 -140) =$1250, and CSLA=
(0.5)(40)(200 -120) =$1600. Under the market con-
ditions in (b), the respective consumer surpluses are 
CSNY=(0.5)(28.3)(240 -126.67) =$1603.67, and 
CSLA=(0.5)(36.7)(200 -126.67) =$1345.67. New 
Yorkers prefer (b) because their price is $126.67 instead of $140, giving them a higher consumer surplus. Customers in Los Angeles prefer (a) because their price is $120 instead of $126.67, and their consumer surplus is greater in (a).
10. a. With individual demands of Q
1 = 10 - P, individual 
consumer surplus is equal to $50 per week, or $2600 per year. An entry fee of $2600 captures all consumer surplus, even though no court fee would be charged, since marginal cost is equal to zero. Weekly prof-its would be equal to the number of serious players, 1000, times the weekly entry fee, $50, minus $10,000, the fixed cost, or $40,000 per week.
 b. When there are two classes of customers, the club 
owner maximizes profits by charging court fees above marginal cost and by setting the entry fee equal to the remaining consumer surplus of the consumer with the smaller demand—the occasional player. The entry fee, T, is equal to the consumer surplus remaining after the 
court fee is assessed: T=(Q
2-0)(16 -P)(1/2), 
where Q2=4-(1/4) P, or T=(1/2)(4 -(1/4) P)
 (16 -P)=32 - 4P+P2/8. Entry fees for all play-
ers would be 2000 (32-4P+P2/8). Revenues from 
court fees equals P (Q1+Q2)=P[1000(10 -P) +
1000(4 -P/4)] =14,000 P-1250 P2. Then total rev-
enue = TR = 64,000 + 6000 P - 1000 P2. Marginal cost is 
zero and marginal revenue is given by the slope of the total revenue curve: /H9004TR/ /H9004P=6000 -2000 P. 
Equating marginal revenue and marginal cost implies a price of $3.00 per hour. Total revenue is equal to $73,000. Total cost is equal to fixed costs of $10,000. So profit is $63,000 per week, which is greater than the $40,000 when only serious players become members.ANSWERS TO SELECTED EXERCISES   •  727
several brands with different prices and characteris-
tics is one method of splitting the market into sets of customers with different price elasticities.
3. a. To maximize profit p =53Q-Q
2-5Q, we find 
/H9004p//H9004Q=-2Q+48=0. Q = 24, so P = 29. Profit 
is equal to 576.
 b. P=53 Q1-Q2, p1=PQ1-C(Q) = 53Q1-Q12 -
Q1Q2-5Q1 and p2=PQ 2-C(Q2)=53Q2 -
Q1Q2-Q22-5Q2.
 c. The problem facing Firm 1 is to maximize profit, given 
that the output of Firm 2 will not change in reaction to the output decision of Firm 1. Therefore, Firm 1 chooses Q
1 to maximize p1, as above. The change in p1
with respect to a change in Q1 is 53 - 2Q1 - Q2 - 5 = 0, 
implying Q1 = 24 - Q2/2. Since the problem is symmet-
ric, the reaction function for Firm 2 is Q2 = 24 - Q1/2.
 d. Solve for the values of Q1 and Q2 that satisfy both reac-
tion functions: Q1 = 24 - (1/2)(24 - Q1/2). So, Q1 = 16 
and Q2 = 16. The price is P = 53 - Q1 - Q2 = 21. Profit 
is p1 = p2 = P · Qi - C(Qi) = 256. Total profit in the 
industry is p1 + p2 = 512.
5.  True.  The reaction curve of Firm 2 will be q2 = 7.5 - 
1/2q1 and the reaction curve of Firm 1 will be q1 = 
15 - 1/2q2. Substituting yields q2 = 0 and q1 = 15. The 
price will be 15, which is the monopoly price.
7. a. (i) In a Cournot equilibrium, when firm A has an 
increase in marginal cost, its reaction function shifts inward. The quantity produced by firm A will decrease and the quantity produced by firm B will increase. Total quantity produced will decrease and price will increase. (ii) In a collusive equilibrium, the two firms will collectively act like a monopolist. When the marginal cost of Firm A increases, Firm A will reduce its production to zero, because Firm B can produce at a lower marginal cost. Because Firm B  can produce the entire industry output at a marginal cost of $50, there will be no change in output or price. However, the firms will have to come to some agree-ment on how to share the profit earned by B. (iii) Because the good is homogeneous, both produce where price equals marginal cost. Firm A increases price to $80 and firm B raises its price to $79.99. Assuming firm B can produce enough output, it will supply the entire market.
 b. (i) The increase in the marginal cost of both firms shifts 
both reaction functions inward. Both firms decrease output, and price will increase. (ii) When marginal cost increases, both firms will produce less and price will increase, as in the monopoly case. (iii) Price will increase and quantity produced will decrease.
 c. (i) Both reaction functions shift outward and both 
firms produce more. Price will increase. (ii) Both firms will increase output, and price will also increase. (iii) Both firms will produce more. Because marginal cost is constant, price will not change. b. With marginal cost of $30, the optimal prices and 
profits are
PRICE 1 PRICE 2 BUNDLED PROFIT
Sell separately $80.00 $80.00 — $200.00
Pure bundling — — $120.00 240.00
Mixed bundling 94.95 94.95 120.00 249.90
Now mixed bundling dominates all other strategies.
CHAPTER 11—APPENDIX
2.  We examine each case, then compare profits.
 a. Optimal quantities and prices with no external mar-
ket for engines are QE=QA=2000, PE=$8000, 
and PA=$18,000. For the engine-building division, 
TR =2000#$8000 =$16M, TC =2(2000)2=$8M, 
and pE=$8M . For the automobile-assembly divi-
sion, TR =2000#$18,000 =$36M, TC =$8000 #
2000 +16M =$32M, and pA=$4M. Total profits 
are $12M.
 b. Optimal quantities and prices with an external market 
for engines are QE=1500, QA=3000, PE=$6000, 
and PA=$17,000. For the engine-building divi-
sion, TR =1500#$6000 =$9M, TC =2(1500)2 =
$4.5M, and p=$4.5M. For the automobile-
assembly division, TR =3000#$17,000 =$51M,
TC =(8000 +6000)3000 =$42M, and p=$9M. 
Total profits are $13.5M.
 c. Optimal quantities and prices with a monopoly 
market for engines are QE=2200, QA=1600, 
PE=$8800, and PA=$18,400, with 600 engines 
sold in the  monopolized market for $9400. For the engine-building division, TR =1600#$8800 +
600#9400 =$19.72M, TC =2(2200)2=$9.68M, and 
p = $10.04M. For the automobile-assembly division, 
TR =1600#$18,400 =TR =1600#$18,400 =
$29.44M,  TC = (8000 +8800)1600 =$26.88M, and 
p = $2.56M. Total profits are $12.6M.
The upstream division, building engines, earns the 
most profit when it has a monopoly on engines. The downstream division, building automobiles, earns the most when there is a competitive market for engines. Given the high cost of engines, the firm does best when engines are produced at the lowest cost with an external, competitive market for engines.
CHAPTER 12
1.  Each firm earns economic profit by distinguishing 
its brand from all other brands. If these competitors merge into a single firm, the resulting monopolist would not produce as many brands as would have been produced before the merger. But, producing 728  •  ANSWERS TO SELECTED EXERCISES
11. a. To determine the Nash equilibrium, we calculate the 
reaction function for each firm, then simultaneously solve for price. Assuming marginal cost is zero , profit 
for Firm 1 is P
1Q1=P1(20-P1+P2)=20P1+
P12+P2P1. MR 1=20-2P1+P2. At the profit-
maximizing price, MR1 = 0. So, P1=(20+P2)/2. 
Because Firm 2 is symmetric to Firm 1, its profit-max-imizing price is P
2=(20+P1)/2. We substitute Firm 
2’s reaction function into that of Firm 1: 
P1[20+(20+P1)/2]/2 =15+P1/4. P1 = 20. By 
symmetry P2 = 20. Then Q1 = 20, and by symmetry Q2 
= 20. Profit for Firm 1 is P1Q1 = 400, and profit for 
Firm 2 is also 400.
 b. If Firm 1 sets its price first, it takes Firm 2’s reaction 
function into account. Firm 1’s profit is p1 =
P1[20-P1+(20+P1)/2]. Then, dp1/dP1=20 -
2P1+10+P1. Setting this expression equal to zero, 
P1=30. We substitute for P1 in Firm 2’s reaction 
function, P2 = 25. At these prices, Q1=20-30 +
25=15 and Q2=20+30-25=25. Profit is 
p1=30 .15=450 and p2=25 . 25=625.
 c. Your first choice should be (iii), and your sec-
ond choice should be (ii). Setting prices above the Cournot equilibrium values is optional for both firms when Stackelberg strategies are followed. From the reaction functions, we know that the price leader provokes a price increase in the follower. But the follower increases price less than the price leader, and hence undercuts the leader. Both firms enjoy increased profits, but the follower does best, and both do better than they would in the Cournot  equilibrium.
CHAPTER 13
1.  If games are repeated indefinitely and all players 
know all payoffs, rational behavior will lead to appar-ently collusive outcomes. But, sometimes the payoffs of other firms can only be known by engaging in extensive information exchanges.
Perhaps the greatest problem to maintaining a 
collusive outcome is exogenous changes in demand and in the prices of inputs. When new information is not available to all players simultaneously, a rational  reaction by one firm could be interpreted as a threat by another firm.
 2. Excess capacity can arise in industries with easy entry 
and differentiated products. Because downward- sloping demand curves for each firm lead to outputs with average cost above minimum average cost, increases in output result in decreases in average cost. The difference between the resulting output and the output at minimum long-run average cost is excess capacity, which can be used to deter new entry.4. a. There are two Nash equilibria: (100,800) and (900,600).
 b. Both managers will follow a high-end strategy, and 
the resulting equilibrium will be (50,50), yielding less profit to both parties.
 c. The cooperative outcome (900,600) maximizes the 
joint profit of the two firms.
 d. Firm 1 benefits the most from cooperation. Compared 
to the next best opportunity, Firm 1 benefits by 900 - 
100 = 800, whereas Firm 2 loses 800 - 600 = 200 under 
cooperation. Therefore, Firm 1 would need to offer Firm 2 at least 200 to compensate for Firm 2’s loss.
6. a. Yes, there are two: (1) Given Firm 2 chooses A, Firm 1 
chooses C; given Firm 1 chooses C, Firm 2 chooses A. 
(2) Given Firm 2 chooses C, Firm 1 chooses A; given 
Firm 1 chooses A, Firm 2 chooses C.
 b. If both firms choose according to maximin, Firm 1 will 
choose Product A and Firm 2 will choose Product A, 
resulting in -10 payoff for both.
 c. Firm 2 will choose Product C in order to maximize 
payoffs at 10, 20.
12.  Although antique auctions often have private-value 
elements, they are primarily common value because dealers are involved. Our antique dealer is disap-pointed in the nearby town’s public auction because estimates of the value of the antiques vary widely and she has suffered from the winner’s curse. At home, where there are fewer well-informed bidders, the winner’s curse has not been a problem.
CHAPTER 14
2.  With the new program, the budget line shifts up 
by the $5000 government grant when the worker does no work at all and takes the maximum amount of leisure hours. As the number of hours worked increases (i.e., leisure decreases), the budget line has half the slope of the original budget line because earned income is taxed at 50 percent. When the after-tax income is $10,000, the new budget line coin-cides with the original budget line. The result is that the new program will have no effect if the worker originally earned more than $10,000 per year, but it will probably reduce the amount of time worked (i.e., increase leisure) if the worker earned less than $10,000 originally.
6.  The demand for labor is given by the marginal 
revenue product of labor; MRP
L = MR · MPL. In 
a competitive market, price is equal to marginal revenue, so MR = 10. The marginal product of 
labor is equal to the slope of the production func-tion Q = 12L - L
2. This slope is equal to 12 - 2L. 
The firm’s profit-maximizing quantity of labor occurs where MRP
L = w, the wage rate. If w = 30, ANSWERS TO SELECTED EXERCISES   •  729
solving for L yields 4.5 hours per day. Similarly, if 
w = 60, solving for L yields 3 hours per day.
8.  The equilibrium wage is where the quantity of labor 
supplied is equal to the quantity of labor demanded, or 20 w = 1,200 - 10w. Solving, w = $40. Substituting 
into the labor supply equation, for example, the equilibrium quantity of labor is: L
S = (20)(40) = 800. 
Economic rent is the difference between the equilib-rium wage and the wage given by the labor supply curve. Here, it is the area above the labor supply curve up to L = 800 and below the equilibrium wage. This 
area is (0.5)(800)($40) = $16,000.
CHAPTER 15
3.  The present discounted value of the first $80 payment 
one year from now is PDV = 80/(1 +0.10)1=$72.73. 
The value of all these coupon payments can be found the same way: PDV =80[1/(1.10)
1+1/(1.10)2+
1/(1.10)3 +1/(1.10)4+1/(1.10)5]=$303.26. The 
present value of the final payment of $1000 in the sixth year is 1000/1.1
6 = $564.47. So the present value 
of this bond is $303.26 + $564.47 = $867.73. With an 
interest rate of 15 percent, PDV = $700.49.
5.  Using R = 0.04, we can substitute the appropriate val-
ues into Equation 15.5. We find that NPV  = -5 - 4.808  
- 0.925  - 0.445 + 0.821 + 0.789 + 0.759 + 0.730 + 0.701 
+ 0.674 + 0.649 + 0.624 + 0.600 + 0.577 + 0.554 + 0.533 
+ 0.513 + 0.493 + 0.474 + 0.456 + 0.438 + 0.456 = –0.338. 
The investment loses $338,000 and is not worthwhile. However, were the discount rate 3%, the NPV  = 
$866,000, and the investment would be worth under-taking.
9. a. If we buy a bottle and sell it after t years, we pay $100 
now and receive 100 t
0.5 when it is sold. The NPV of 
this investment is NPV =-100 +e-rt100t0.5 =
-100 +e-0.1t100t0.5.
If we do buy a bottle, we will choose t to maximize 
the NPV. The necessary condition is dNPV/ dt = e -0.1t
(50 - t -0.5) - 0.1e -0.1t · 100 t0.5 = 0. Solving, t = 5. If we 
hold the bottle 5 years, the NPV is -100 + e -0.1·5100 · 
50.5 = 35.62. Since each bottle is a good investment, we 
should buy all 100 bottles.
 b. You are offered $130 for resale, so you would make 
an immediate profit of $30. However, if you hold the wine for 5 years, the NPV of your profit is $35.62 as shown in part (a). Therefore, the NPV if you sell immediately rather than hold for 5 years is $30  - 
35.62 = -$5.62, and you should not sell.
 c. If the interest rate changes from 10 percent to 5 per-
cent, the NPV calculation changes to NPV = -100 + 
e
- 0.05t#100t0.5. If we hold the bottle 10 years, the maxi-
mum NPV is -100 + e- 0.05·10#100#100.5 = $91.80.
11. a. Compare buying the car to leasing the car, with r = 
0.04. The present value net cost of buying is -20,000 + 12,000/(1 + 0.04)6 = -10,516.22. The present value 
cost of leasing the car is -3600 - 3600/(1 + 0.04)1 - 
3600/(1 + 0.04)2 = -10,389.94. You are better off 
 leasing the car if r = 4 percent.
 b. Again, compare buying to leasing: 20,000 + 12,000/
(1 + 0.12)6 = -13,920.43 with buying, versus -3600 - 
3600/(1 + 0.12)1 - 3600/(1 + 0.12)2 = -9,684.18 with leas-
ing. You are better off leasing the car if r = 12 percent.
 c. Consumers will be indifferent when the present 
value cost of buying and later selling the car equals the present value cost of leasing: -20,000 + 12,000/
(1 + r)
6 = -3600 - 3600/(1 + r)1 - 3600/(1 + r)2. This 
is true when r = 3.8 percent. You can solve this 
 equation using a graphing calculator or computer spreadsheet, or by trial and error.
CHAPTER 16
6.  Even with identical preferences, the contract curve 
may or may not be a straight line. This can easily be shown graphically. For example, when both individu-als have utility functions U = x
2y, the marginal rate of 
substitution is given by 2 y/x. It is not difficult to show 
that the MRS’s of both individuals are equal for all points on the contract curve y = (Y/X)x, where X and 
Y are the total quantities of both goods. One example 
in which the contract curve is not a straight line is when the two individuals have different incomes and one good is inferior.
7.  The marginal rate of transformation is equal to the 
ratio of the marginal costs of producing the two goods. Most production possibilities frontiers are “bowed outward.” However, if the two goods are produced with constant returns to scale production functions, the production possibilities frontier is a straight line.
10.  A change from a constant-returns-to-scale produc-
tion process to a sharply-increasing-returns-to-scale process does not imply a change in the shape of the isoquants. One can simply redefine the quantities associated with each isoquant such that proportional increases in inputs yield greater than proportional increases in outputs. Under this assumption, the mar-ginal rate of technical substitution would not change, and there would be no change in the production con-tract curve.
CHAPTER 17
5. a. In the recent past, American automobiles appeared to 
customers to be of low quality. To reverse this trend, American companies invested in quality  control, improving the potential repair records of their prod-ucts. They signaled the improved quality of their products through improved warranties.
 b. Moral hazard occurs when the party to be insured (the 
owner of an American automobile with an extensive 730  •  ANSWERS TO SELECTED EXERCISES
not high enough to permit swimming, the fee could 
be increased.
The setting of a standard will be efficient only if 
the policymaker has complete information regard-ing the marginal costs and benefits of abatement. Further, the standard will not encourage firms to reduce effluent further if new filtering technologies become available. A transferable effluent permit system still requires the policymaker to determine the efficient effluent standard. Once the permits are distributed, a market will develop and firms with a higher cost of abatement will purchase permits from firms with lower abatement costs. However, unless permits are sold initially, no revenue will be generated.
9. a. Profit is maximized when marginal revenue is equal 
to marginal cost. With a constant marginal revenue of $40 and a marginal cost of 10 + 5Q, Q = 6.
 b. If bees are not forthcoming, the farmer must 
pay $10 per acre for artificial pollination. Since  
the farmer would be willing to pay up to $10 to the  beekeeper to maintain each additional hive, the marginal social benefit of each is $50, which is greater than the marginal private benefit of $40. Equating the marginal social benefit to the  
marginal cost, Q = 80.
 c. The most radical change that would lead to more 
efficient operations would be the merger of the farm-er’s business with the beekeeper’s business. This merger would internalize the positive externality of bee pollination. Short of a merger, the farmer and beekeeper should enter into a contract for pollina-tion services.warranty) can influence the probability or the magni-
tude of the event that triggers payment (the repair of the automobile). Covering all parts and labor associ-ated with mechanical problems reduces the incentive to maintain the automobile. Hence, a moral hazard problem is created with extensive warranties.
7.  Moral hazard problems arise with fire insurance when 
the insured party can influence the probability of a fire. The property owner can reduce the probability of a fire or its impact by inspecting and replacing faulty wiring, installing warning systems, etc. After purchas-ing complete insurance, the insured has little incentive to reduce either the probability or the magnitude of the loss, so the moral hazard problem can be severe. In order to compare a $10,000 deductible and 90 per-cent coverage, we need information on the value of the potential loss. Both policies reduce the moral hazard problem of complete coverage. However, if the prop-erty is worth less (more) than $100,000, the total loss will be less (more) with 90 percent coverage than with the $10,000 deductible. As the value of the property increases above $100,000, the owner is more likely to engage in fire prevention efforts under the policy that offers 90 percent coverage than under the one that offers the $10,000 deductible.
CHAPTER 18
4.  One needs to know the value to homeowners of 
swimming in the river, and the marginal cost of abatement. The choice of a policy tool will depend on the marginal benefits and costs of abatement. If firms are charged an equal rate effluent fee, the firms will reduce effluent to the point where the marginal cost of abatement is equal to the fee. If this reduction is Photo Credits
